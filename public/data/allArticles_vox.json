Now, NPR <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/10/577093288/top-fox-news-d-c-reporter-james-rosen-left-network-after-harassment-claims\">reports</a> that Rosen’s departure came amid sexual harassment allegations from some of Fox News’s female journalists. </p>\n<p>NPR’s David Folkenflik <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/10/577093288/top-fox-news-d-c-reporter-james-rosen-left-network-after-harassment-claims\">confirmed</a> details of the accusations with eight of Rosen’s former Fox News colleagues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>According to Rosen’s former colleagues ... he had an established pattern of flirting aggressively with many peers and had made sexual advances toward three female Fox News journalists, including two reporters and a producer. And his departure followed increased scrutiny of his behavior at the network, according to colleagues.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rosen tried to forcibly grope or kiss co-workers, sources told NPR. None of the women were identified in the report, and NPR verified their accounts with colleagues who were aware of the inappropriate encounters. One incident occurred as far back as the winter of 2001, when Rosen allegedly groped the breasts of a female journalist in a cab. After she turned him down, he allegedly tried to poach some of her sources. </p>\n<p>A female producer also accused Rosen of sexual harassment, and a female journalist also alleged Rosen tried to forcibly kiss her in an elevator after she refused his first advances. </p>\n<p>The women involved in the incidents did not comment directly to Folkenflik. Rosen also declined to comment to NPR. (Vox reached out to Fox News for comment, but has not yet heard back.)</p>\n<h2>Fox News comes under scrutiny again</h2>\n<p>Sexual harassment allegations have rocked major networks and publications across the industry, ushering in the abrupt ousters of high-profile media figures. </p>\n<p>Rosen isn’t the only journalist facing scrutiny this week — the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/post-reporter-joel-achenbach-suspended-for-90-days-for-inappropriate-workplace-conduct/2018/01/10/5fae0f4a-f645-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html?utm_term=.3eabbbf57d0e\">suspended</a> reporter Joel Achenbach 90 days for “inappropriate workplace conduct” allegedly involving female journalists. </p>\n<p>But the accusations against Rosen refocus some attention back on Fox News. The cable news network has wrestled with the fallout from several high-profile misconduct allegations in recent years, along with the revelations that Fox News was aware of misconduct and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html\">had contributed to payouts</a> for some of the women.</p>\n<p>Fox News’s powerful chief and mastermind Roger Ailes was ousted from the network after host Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against Ailes in July 2016. She and <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/07/six-more-women-allege-ailes-sexual-harassment.html\">multiple other women</a> came forward with allegations against him. Then, last April, Fox News lost one of its marquee names, when host Bill O’Reilly was forced out following an advertising boycott after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/media/bill-oreilly-fox-news-allegations.html\">New York Times revealed</a> a series of settlements, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/media/bill-oreilly-fox-news-allegations.html\">totaling $13 million</a>, with women over sexual harassment allegations. (It was later reported to be six settlements<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment.html\"> totaling $45 million</a>.) Fox News had been aware of complaints against O’Reilly. </p>\n<p>Fox News fired two other employees, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-payne-fox-harassment-20170908-story.html\">host Eric Bolling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/07/26/ex-executive-says-he-was-scapegoat-for-fox-news-sexual-harassment-in-48-million-lawsuit/?utm_term=.b1be4a409b46\">executive Francisco Cortes</a>, following misconduct accusations. </p>\n<p>Again, Fox News isn’t the only network facing such allegations, or to have mishandled sexual harassment complaints. But there have been questions on whether the network has done enough to address a culture that allowed for such predation. </p>\n<p>Rupert Murdoch, the co-executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/murdoch-fox-returning-to-our-roots-in-524bn-disney-deal-11170762\">said in an interview with Sky News</a> in December that it was “nonsense” that the misconduct allegations had hurt the network’s business. </p>\n<p>“There was a problem with our chief executive sort of over the years, but isolated incidents,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-16/fox-clarifies-murdoch-s-nonsense-sexual-harassment-comments\">Murdoch said. </a>“As soon as we investigated he was out of the place in hours — well, three or four days — and there’s been nothing else since then.”</p>\n<p>He added that the attention “was largely political because we are conservative.”</p>\n<p>“Now of course all the liberals are going down the drain,” <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/murdoch-fox-returning-to-our-roots-in-524bn-disney-deal-11170762\">Murdoch said,</a> referring to allegations at other networks. “There are really bad cases that people should be moved aside, and there are other things which probably amount to a bit of flirting, you know?”</p>\n<p>Fox issued a clarification, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-16/fox-clarifies-murdoch-s-nonsense-sexual-harassment-comments\">saying in a statement, </a>“Rupert has made it abundantly clear that he understands that there were real problems at Fox News.” But Rosen’s quiet departure, and the subsequent report by NPR, indicate that the network — as many other new outlets — is still grappling with how to handle such sexual misconduct allegations within its ranks. </p>",

Smiley will serve as the event’s moderator. </p>\n<p>“We need to have a national dialogue about these issues so women and men know how to engage each other in the workplace. I am eager to join this essential conversation, starting with this tour,” Smiley said in the Facebook post.</p>\n<p>In December, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/pbs-suspends-distribution-of-tavis-smiley-after-misconduct-allegations\">PBS announced</a> that following a misconduct investigation into Smiley, the network would suspend distributing the host’s popular long-running nightly talk show. An outside investigation “uncovered multiple, credible allegations of conduct that is inconsistent with the values and standards of PBS, and the totality of this information led to today’s decision,” a PBS spokeswoman said in December. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/tavis-smiley-pbs-1202639424/\">According to Variety</a>, the investigation “found credible allegations that Smiley had engaged in sexual relationships with multiple subordinates.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Variety reported,<strong> </strong>“witnesses described Smiley as creating a verbally abusive and threatening environment that went beyond what could be expected in a typical high-pressure work environment. Several expressed concerns about retaliation.”</p>\n<p>Smiley has vehemently denied those allegations, vowing to “<a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/suspended-pbs-host-tavis-smiley-vows-to-fight-back-agai-1821291403\">fight back</a>” against his inclusion in the list of prominent men felled by sexual misconduct allegations in recent months. It appears that he sees this tour as one way to do it. </p>\n<p>While Smiley later acknowledged that he had engaged in a relationship with a former employee, he argued that the investigation was “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TavisTalks/videos/10155818158281278/\">biased and sloppy,</a>” saying that he was only been made aware of it when former members of his staff told him about it. </p>\n<p>Smiley sought to distinguish himself from other men that have been swept up in the ongoing sexual harassment reckoning, arguing that his relationships were consensual and should not be lumped in with egregious sexual misconduct. </p>\n<p>“I celebrate and applaud these women who have had the courage to come out and to tell their truth, and lead us in a conversation about how to create healthy work spaces,” he said during a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GMA/status/942737477919416320\">December 18 interview</a> on Good Morning America. “At the same time I want to make sure we don’t lose all sense of nuance and proportionality in this conversation because, if we do, people end up being guilty simply by accusation.”</p>\n<p>Smiley’s prior statement that he had only one relationship with a subordinate was contradicted during that interview, in which he admitted to having had relationships with multiple employees, a discrepancy that PBS said further <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/18/pbs-says-tavis-smiley-should-get-his-story-straight-about-sexual-relationships-with-employees/?utm_term=.1942f263bf51\">justified</a> the suspension. </p>\n<p>Smiley hopes to bounce back quickly. In the same statement announcing the tour, Smiley said that he had signed a deal to host a new online show called “The Upside with Tavis Smiley.” According to Smiley, the show “will celebrate the spirit of resilience, the power to overcome that resides in each of us.”</p>",

The book, which purports to reveal <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">the toxic inner workings of the Trump White House</a>, has flown off the shelves so quickly that there are few left: You can’t get a hard copy of <em>Fire and Fury</em>, well, basically anywhere.</p>\n<p>Amazon is expecting a two- to four-week wait. Barnes &amp; Noble warns customers that they won’t have the book back in stock <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Ffire-and-fury-michael-wolff%2F1127464088%23%2F\" target=\"_blank\">until January 19</a>. The New York Public Library has <a href=\"http://time.com/5090567/donald-trump-michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-library/\">more than 1,000 holds</a> on its 49 copies. Independent bookstores report that they sold out <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/politics/news/trump-fire-and-fury-sales-1202655013/\">on the first day the book was available</a>. The supply here is not coming anywhere close<strong> </strong>to meeting the demand.</p>\n<p>Some commentators have suggested that’s because Wolff’s publisher, Henry Holt and Co., “botched” the rollout. “Holt’s struggles to keep up with demand have deprived thousands of readers of a book they want right away and likely cost significant sales,” <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/146544/fire-fury-took-publishing-world-surprise\">wrote Alex Shephard at the New Republic</a>, decrying Holt’s “flat-footed” response and calling the situation a “debacle.”</p>\n<p>It’s true that Henry Holt and Co. significantly underestimated the demand for <em>Fire and Fury</em>. John Sargent, the CEO for Holt parent company Macmillan, <a href=\"https://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2018/01/macmillan-1-million-fire-fury-hardcovers-process-sold-hundreds-thousands-ebooks/\">has said</a> that <em>Fire and Fury</em> had an initial print run of 150,000 copies, and that to keep up with demand, Henry Holt has begun a second print run of more than 1 million copies. “We would never have predicted [President Trump’s] statement and thus never have predicted the full scope of demand for the book,” Sargent said, referring to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/5/16854008/donald-trump-michael-wolff-fire-fury-authors-guild-libel-suit-threat\">Trump’s threat to sue both Michael Wolff and Henry Holt for libel</a>, which sparked such widespread interest in the book that Holt moved up the publication date from January 9 to January 5. </p>\n<p>At the New Republic, Shephard argues that while Holt couldn’t have foreseen Trump’s threats, it should have known interest in the book would be high regardless. “Henry Holt not only had the first<em> Game Change</em>-style book about the Trump White House,” <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/146544/fire-fury-took-publishing-world-surprise\">he writes</a>, “but also an author who, unlike <em>Game Change </em>authors Mark Halperin and John [Heilemann], was more than willing to burn his sources.”</p>\n<p>But the scales of publishing are set up to heavily encourage Holt to hedge its bets and err on the side of a lower print run. While it’s arguable Holt should have known it had a big hit on its hands, all of the business practices of the publishing industry would have discouraged it from starting out with a print run big enough to accommodate current demand.</p>\n<p>Here’s how<strong> </strong>publishing works to keep print runs conservative, and how it led to you not being able to buy a hard copy of <em>Fire and Fury</em> anywhere.</p>\n<h3>In book publishing, megahit best-seller numbers look very different from those of ordinary best-sellers</h3>\n<p>Scales of success in book publishing are very, very quirky. </p>\n<p>There are some books that become major cultural touchstones that everyone in the country wants to read and have an opinion on — your <em>Harry Potter</em>s and your <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>s. Those books sell millions of copies and are wildly in demand.</p>\n<p>But those books are vanishingly rare. Most books, including most best-sellers, are not major cultural touchstones. They might be well-respected, well-reviewed, and well-read, but that usually means sales in the range of hundreds of thousands, at best, not in the millions. </p>\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/futurebook/bestselling-books-2014\">the two best-selling books of the year</a> were true cultural events: <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, which sold 1.2 million copies over the course of the year, and <em>Gone Girl</em>, which sold just under a million. </p>\n<p>The third-best-selling book of the year? <em>Awful Auntie</em>, a children’s book that sold just over half a million copies. </p>\n<p>Which means that the difference between the third-best-selling book of the year and the No. 1<strong> </strong>best-selling book of the year can be <em>m</em><em>o</em><em>re than </em><em>500,000 books</em>, an increase of 100 percent. </p>\n<p>That’s a ridiculous level of variance! How can anyone possibly predict that a book, even a book you truly believe in, will be a No. 1 best-seller with a justified print run of a million-plus copies, rather than a No. 3<strong> </strong>best-seller, better served by a more conservative print run of several hundred thousand copies?</p>\n<p>When <em>Fire and Fury</em> got an initial print run of 150,000, it was a show of confidence. It suggested that Holt believed it could enter into respectable best-seller range, maybe even third-best-selling-book-of-the-year range. Holt just wasn’t confident that the book was No. 1<strong> </strong>best-seller-of-the-year material.</p>\n<p>And it had good reason to be cautious. Because if publishers get it wrong and overestimate their print runs, the economic ramifications can be painful.</p>\n<h3>An outdated Depression-era returns policy means publishers have to print low</h3>\n<p>Book publishing’s returns policy is different from that of almost every<strong> </strong>other industry. Essentially, if a bookstore doesn’t sell all its copies of a book, it can return unsold copies to the publisher for full credit, regardless of their condition, and the publisher will pay the shipping costs. </p>\n<p>“Imagine that Best Buy had the right to return all its flat-screen TVs to the manufacturer, at cost,” a publisher once told me bitterly, “and it didn’t matter if they all had their screens kicked in. And then the manufacturer was like, ‘Sure, we’ll pay for the trucks.’”</p>\n<p>In practice, that means that the major booksellers, particularly Amazon and Target, will often over-order books on the off chance they might need them, and then return them a few months later to the publisher, having lost nothing but the cost of processing and briefly storing the books. (Indie bookstores, with their limited space, tend to order more conservatively.) </p>\n<p>It’s a Depression-era policy that never quite got updated, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91461568\">NPR reported in 2008</a>: “During the Great Depression, publishers were looking for a way to encourage booksellers to buy more books and to take a chance on unknown authors. So they offered bookstores the right to return unsold books for credit.” </p>\n<p>Now the policy is thoroughly entrenched in the way publishers and booksellers do business. And that means that when publishers are figuring out how many copies of a book to print, they have to figure that <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/70298-with-print-book-sales-stabilized-return-rate-lowers.html\">roughly 20</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brooke-warner/putting-an-end-to-returns_b_7794600.html\">to 30 percent</a> of the books they print will come back to them as returns. So if you’re a publisher, you have to plan on eating the cost of two or three<strong> </strong>books for every 10 you sell — plus shipping — and then somehow figure out how to still make a profit.</p>\n<p>All of which means that print runs are <em>already</em> inflated just to cover the returned books that publishers don’t expect to sell. If you overestimate demand for a book and print too many copies, you just burden yourself with even more excess inventory that you need to pay to store, on top of the excess inventory already coming in from bookstore<strong> </strong>returns. </p>\n<p>All of this is to say that in an industry as quirky and illogical as book publishing — a business run by English majors — the incentive to lowball a print run is strong. Henry Holt and Co. may have botched the release of <em>Fire and Fury</em>, but it had an entire industry’s worth of norms pushing it to do so.</p>",

She was the first woman to fly solo nonstop across the United States and the first woman — and second person, after Charles Lindbergh — to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean. But she wasn’t the only record-breaking female flier of her time, and she certainly wasn't the best. </p>\n<p>Earhart’s contemporaries Louise Thaden, Ruth Nichols, and Beryl Markham were arguably more competent pilots and had record-breaking careers of their own. But they didn’t get the same recognition as Earhart, who went on to become an iconic name in aviation. What set her apart from her peers was a carefully executed publicity campaign.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aLCPysNDS97mOc1w9aPYvT5hZm0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10009829/GettyImages_530843062.jpg\">\n<cite>Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Aviatrix Ruth Elder sitting on her plane engine, 1929.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Earhart’s husband, George Palmer Putnam, was an influential American book publisher who chose Earhart to fly (as a passenger) over the Atlantic Ocean in 1928, making her the first woman to do so.

Maryland state Sen. Jim Rosapepe, one of the co-sponsors of the plan, tells me they’d like to set the fees similar to where they’ve been under the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>And it doesn’t stop there. Instead of simply collecting fines from the uninsured, the Maryland proposal would give those people the option to use their penalty money to purchase a health insurance plan. (You can read a one-page fact sheet about the plan <a href=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10010187/Fact.Sheet.HealthInsuranceDownpayment.010817.1pm__1_.0.pdf\">here</a>). </p>\n<p>”Instead of looking at it as a penalty, Maryland would look at it as a health insurance down payment,” says Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at Families USA, a pro-Obamacare advocacy group that has worked on the plan. </p>\n<p>”The point of this effort is to get people health insurance,” says Rosapepe. “It’s not to penalize people. It was kind of crazy [under the ACA] to collect these penalties and then go spend them for national defense. I’m all for national defense, but why not put that money toward buying these people coverage?”</p>\n<p>The idea, as Dorn and Rosapepe outline it, <em>isn’t </em>to collect penalties from people who didn’t buy coverage. Instead, it’s to do everything the state can to nudge those people into using the fee to enroll in a plan.</p>\n<p>It does so in a few ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Making enrollment in health care — instead of paying the fine — the default option. </strong>As the legislators behind the Maryland plan envision it, they would send out a form to those who were uninsured the previous year. It would tell them that unless they take action, the state will use that penalty to pay premiums on a new health plan. The state will describe it as a “health care down payment.” Tax filers would have to check a box to opt out of this option, to affirmatively choose to pay their fine to the government and not get coverage. “If you really want to pay the fine, you check the box,” Dorn says. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>The state begins to play a role in helping consumers shop for health insurance. </strong>The Maryland plan envisions a significantly bigger role for the state, where it would match uninsured consumers into zero-dollar premium plans. Usually it’s the individual who does all the shopping and comparisons. But Maryland envisions the state trying to make it even easier to enroll in coverage by taking over that shopping experience. This does, however, raise the question of how the government will decide which plan is the best for the consumer if there are multiple options at zero dollars — and what role that consumer will play in the choice. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Allowing uninsured Marylanders to hold their penalty fee in escrow until the next enrollment period. </strong>There will certainly be people who <em>can’t </em>find a zero-dollar premium plan. These might be people with higher incomes who don’t qualify for federal subsidies and who would be required to chip monthly payments of their own. For those people, Maryland escrow offering to hold the penalty payment in an ESCROW account until open enrollment — when they could shop for a plan that they’d pay for with a combination of the penalty fee and their own money.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Maryland has been thinking about how to deal with Obamacare repeal for a while</strong></h3>\n<p>The state was able to move quickly because for the past year — ever since Trump was elected to the presidency — it has run a commission on protecting health care. The whole point was to come up with a plan to keep as much of the Affordable Care Act as possible intact in the Maryland should Republicans in Congress be successful with their repeal efforts.</p>\n<p>It is that commission that heard a presentation from Dorn on the idea of health care down payments. </p>\n<p>The Maryland legislative session runs for 90 days — through early April — and the sponsors of this plan are aiming to get a bill passed by the end of it. </p>\n<h3><strong>Other states could follow the Maryland approach</strong></h3>\n<p><strong> </strong>Dorn says (and I agree) that this approach would be pretty easy to export to any state that runs its own marketplace and has a state income tax. This list includes nine states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Another 10 states have a marketplace that is run in partnership with the federal government as well as a state income tax, which may be enough to move the Maryland idea forward. </p>\n<h3><strong>What the wonks say</strong></h3>\n<p>Duke University’s David Anderson — a very close observer of the health law marketplaces — describes Maryland’s idea as “nifty and creative. It also highlights the extreme option value of a state running its own exchange. I don’t know if Healthcare.gov could mechanically do what Maryland wants to do.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Gruber at MIT told me he sees it as a “very promising way to combine the best of standard health economics (the mandate) with the best of behavioral economics (the auto-enrollment).” One challenge he raised was identifying the uninsured — since Maryland will rely on tax forms from the prior year, it’s possible the state will miss some people who recently lost coverage. </p>\n<p><em>This story appears in VoxCare, a newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate.

She was accepting the Cecil B. DeMille award for career achievement and taking the opportunity to speak out against sexual assault in America. But to many viewers, it looked as though she was also in the process of launching a bid for the White House, and this speech was her “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/the-ad-that-helped-reagan-sell-good-times-to-an-uncertain-nation.html\">it’s morning again in America</a>” moment. </p>\n<p>Oprah’s speech was stirring, hopeful, even statesman-like — and many Democrats eagerly pounced on it. </p>\n<p>“Lord, we need passion and excitement,” state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/talk-of-oprah-running-for-president-captivates-democrats/2018/01/08/2498180c-f4a5-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html?utm_term=.dd2f4e9763a9\">told the Washington Post</a>. “I know it’s conjecture right now, but I’d ask her to give it serious consideration. If anybody could bring us together, it’s her.”</p>\n<p>It’s not “the craziest of ideas,” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/8/16862592/oprah-golden-globes-president\">wrote Vox’s Emily Stewart</a>. CNN reported that <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/08/media/oprah-golden-globes/index.html\">Oprah was actively considering the idea</a> of running. </p>\n<p>“It’s up to the people,” her longtime partner, Stedman Graham, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mog-golden-globes-oprah-president-20180107-story.html\">told the LA Times</a>. “She would absolutely do it.”</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Oprah 2020, explained&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/9/16868252/oprah-2020-president-explained&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>Complicating many observers’ response to the possibility of a President Oprah is our current president, Donald Trump, who like Oprah is a TV celebrity first and foremost. </p>\n<p>“I think one of the arguments for Oprah is 45,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/talk-of-oprah-running-for-president-captivates-democrats/2018/01/08/2498180c-f4a5-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html?utm_term=.dd2f4e9763a9\">Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post</a>, referring to Trump by his rank as the United States’ 45th president. “I think one of the arguments against Oprah is 45.”</p>\n<p>Trump and Oprah represent two poles of the fantasy of the celebrity president, one of America’s favorite daydreams. It was the fantasy America indulged when it elected Ronald Reagan, when it salivated over the Kennedys’ every move, when it mused over how <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/30/opinions/obeidallah-jon-stewart-president/index.html\">Jon Stewart</a>. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/25/opinions/colbert-president-2020-trump-obeidallah-opinion/index.html\">Stephen Colbert</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/dwayne-johnson-seriously-considering-running-for-president-w514003\">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a>, etc. should be president.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There's something so inevitable about the American people getting to choose between the TV person whose signature move is firing people and the TV person whose signature move is everyone getting a free car.</p>— Tom Gara (@tomgara) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/950417589523632128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>The celebrity president is an enduring fantasy, and that’s not (only) because America likes electing political neophytes to high office. </p>\n<p>Celebrities are avatars of America’s subconscious. They are the people onto whom we project all our deepest fears and fantasies. </p>\n<p>Marilyn Monroe represented sex and innocence simultaneously; she is the vessel into which postwar American culture poured all of its erotic longings and all of its Freudian anxieties. Cary Grant represented postwar American masculinity at its most virile; Jimmy Stewart was the American Everyman, humble and downtrodden but always striving to do the right thing. Today, Beyoncé represents goddess-like empowerment. </p>\n<p>So when we fantasize about electing a celebrity as president, we’re not imagining that Oprah is secretly a brilliant legislator or that the Rock has hidden depths as a policy wonk. We’re imagining that the perfect, untouchable, and morally righteous figure of our dreams can stride straight off the screen into the White House and make everything better.</p>\n<h3>Reagan and Trump both embodied different TV dad fantasies, to wild success</h3>\n<p>If anyone understood how powerful the fantasy of the celebrity president could be, it was Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s star image was practically designed for the presidency: all twinkling avuncular eyes and an air of condescending father-knows-best competence.</p>\n<p>His competence felt familiar and reliable, because he’d spent years inside of American living rooms, on TV, and in movies. Reagan’s star image was a known quantity, intimate. He didn’t just feel like <em>a</em> father figure; he felt like <em>your</em> father figure, a sense that he courted and developed assiduously. </p>\n<p>In televised press conferences, he spoke to reporters, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/132690/host-ronald-reagan\">the New Republic wrote in 1984</a>, “on a cozy, chummy, faintly paternalistic first-name basis.” Reagan knew how to act as the benevolent dad not just to the nation, but to every individual person who might be in his base, right on down to the press pool. </p>\n<p>The question of whether or not Reagan himself <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/01/ronald-reagan-policy-political-failure\">was a competent president</a> was irrelevant to the fantasy he personified to his supporters. Reagan didn’t need to be good at his job; he just needed to look like he was good at it. </p>\n<p>He embodied the ideal of a benevolent patriarch for the conservative base that he mobilized, who badly wanted a father-knows-best type at the helm. They wanted someone to bring the hippies and the poor and the minorities and the counterculture types in line — but someone who would do it in a way that felt respectable. Fatherly.</p>\n<p>Trump, in contrast, harnessed a much less benign-seeming fantasy to make his way to the White House. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/what-would-trump-be-without-twitter?utm_term=.hjzBa6MVA#.wywPzZEN8\">Anne Helen Petersen captured this shortly after Trump’s election</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In truth, Trump was a reality star just waiting for the reality age: No other medium portrays his impulse toward conspicuous consumption and conspicuous demonstrations of power as effectively. With <em>The Apprentice</em>, Trump solidified the reality era–tinged understanding of the American dream: It’s not actual hard work that makes you successful, but the ability to evince the <em>feeling and effect</em> of power and wealth.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump didn’t exude competence and fatherliness so much as he exuded wealth, power, a kind of crassness that can feel like honesty, and most of all, rage at those who had made America not great anymore. Only Trump’s wealth, power, and greed could fix it. He was Archie Bunker to Reagan’s Ward Cleaver, and he became wildly successful.</p>\n<h3>Oprah’s star image is based on empathy, wisdom, and success — qualities in demand from a large swath of the electorate</h3>\n<p>The President Oprah fantasy is different. Oprah’s star image is rooted not so much in rage and resentment as it is in a sense of wisdom and kindness and empathy. </p>\n<p>Oprah the celebrity is not a condescending-but-correct <em>L</em><em>eave It </em><em>t</em><em>o Beaver</em> dad, like Reagan was, or a furious real-talk-delivery-system Archie Bunker dad, like Trump. Instead, she’s a nonthreatening, endlessly positive mother figure. She loves you no matter what. She is wise and positive and understanding. When she talks to her audience onscreen, you feel like she’s talking just to you.</p>\n<p>Director Ava DuVernay has <a href=\"http://kticradio.com/abc_entertai/ava-duvernay-reveals-why-she-cast-oprah-in-a-wrinkle-in-time-abcid36012107/\">called Oprah</a> “the all–knowing, wisest lady in the universe.” Oprah is “the best woman alive,” <a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/eight-reasons-why-oprah-is-the-best-woman-alive-6509174\">the Miami New Times</a> once declared. “Oprah has a unique way of connecting with people,” <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hennainam/2013/07/30/why-oprah-is-worth-2-8-billion-the-power-of-questions/#58355242657b\">says Forbes</a>. </p>\n<p>“She understands how to connect with audiences and give them what they want at a particular time,” Janice Peck, author of <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Age-of-Oprah-Cultural-Icon-for-the-Neoliberal-Era/Peck/p/book/9781594514685\"><em>The Age of Oprah</em></a>, told me. “She’s always been very smart at figuring at who her audience is and how to resonate with them.”</p>\n<p>“She’s identified as this warm, caring, super successful, and absolutely non-controversial figure,” Peck explained. “There’s this sense that Oprah would be good at being president because she’s so good at all this other stuff. She has an ability to connect with an audience.”</p>\n<p>But Peck argues that Oprah’s ability to connect with her audience is in and of itself political. Part of the secret to her enduring appeal, Peck says, is her ability to keep white women — her biggest demographic — from thinking of her as black. “You have all these white fans who have historically talked about her as if she is a personal friend of theirs, as if she could come into their homes,” Peck said, “which of course she did, on their TV screens.” </p>\n<p>Oprah’s celebrity image, Peck argues, is at once empowering, carefully non-threatening, and appealing to mainstream liberals. “She’s a reminder of the ways in which there was supposed to be this erasure of race,” Peck argues, and of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/post-racial-society-distant-dream/395255/\">the post-racial moment</a> that America was imagined to have entered after Obama took office in 2008 but which never truly emerged. </p>\n<p>“She’s in favor of racial opportunity and fairness,” Peck said, “but she also has taken a lot of opportunities in her past to distance herself from the so-called black underclass, from those she considers to be angry black people.” (<a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/books/oprah-winfrey-cultural-icon-mainstream-white-america\">Peck cites remarks of Oprah’s like</a>, “Race is not an issue. It has never been an issue with me. … Truth is, I’ve never felt prevented from doing anything because I was either black or a woman,” which Peck said seem to ignore the systemic inequalities of American society.) “And all of those moves cement her as someone that mainstream liberals can relate to and not be threatened by.” </p>\n<p>The fantasy of President Oprah, then, is not a fantasy that supposes that Oprah Winfrey, billionaire businesswoman and media icon, is also<strong> </strong>secretly a political genius. </p>\n<p>“Many of the same people horrified about Obama would be horrified about her, for racial reasons,” Peck said. “Then there would be gender reasons. It’s not like it’s everybody who wants President Oprah. The people who are really responsive here, she resonates for them because she is a neoliberal Democrat. She’s like Obama or Clinton. It’s like, ‘We need to bring that person back, and she’s got charisma. Why not?’”</p>\n<p>It’s a fantasy that a figure of non-controversial warmth, wisdom, and empathy; of post-racial unity and post-feminist idealism; of the beloved Obama era — that this figure could take control of the country, affect change, and <em>fix everything</em>.</p>\n<p>This is the antithesis of the fantasy represented by Trump. There’s a reason Trump impulsively said he’d like to have Oprah as his vice president <a href=\"http://ew.com/tv/2018/01/08/donald-trump-oprah-winfrey-vice-president-larry-king-live/\">back in 1999</a>: Her image is a perfect photographic negative of his, warm and nurturing where his is harsh and abrasive, uplifting and giving where his is withholding and punishing.</p>\n<p>The fantasy is the idea that when Oprah says, “I’m here to help you turn up the volume in your life,” she means it for all of us, forever. And that she can really do it — because if Oprah can’t, who can?</p>",

It’s also created an odd coalition of opponents including environmental groups and Republican lawmakers in coastal states like South Carolina and Florida.</p>\n<p>But on Tuesday, the Department of Interior was already starting to walk back parts of its sweeping proposal. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced in a tweet that he was removing Florida from the draft proposal because Florida is “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretaryZinke/status/950876846698180608\">unique</a> and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.” But many interpreted it as a brazen political favor to Gov. Rick Scott.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FLGovScott?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FLGovScott</a>, I am removing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Florida?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Florida</a> from the draft offshore plan. <a href=\"https://t.co/lZIfdCDNOR\">pic.twitter.com/lZIfdCDNOR</a></p>— Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretaryZinke/status/950870010242719745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Leaders of other coastal states are now irritated — they not only object to the proposal but are also questioning why the Interior Department heeded Florida’s concerns about drilling’s threat to tourism and wildlife but not theirs.</p>\n<p>It was, after all, only eight years ago that 4 million gallons of crude oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico in the epically disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

There’s also growing competition from other energy sources and applications, with electric vehicles and renewables gaining ground and challenging the place of oil and gas in transportation and power production.</p>\n<p>Given this backdrop, I asked Jack Gerard, CEO and president of the American Petroleum Institute, whether there is a business case to drill for oil and gas in these new areas. “The answer to that is, ‘We’ll have to see,’” he said. </p>\n<p>For now, the big thing the industry wants to do is find what’s out there, something that’s hard to discern without drilling test wells. Then they want to see where it would be cheap and easy to extract, which is governed largely by the presence of existing oil and gas infrastructure. </p>\n<p>That means new offshore drilling is likeliest in areas that already have offshore oil platforms. But having new waters to explore is still important for oil companies because it allows them to hedge in a notoriously volatile industry. </p>\n<p>“It’s our view that more options are always preferable when it comes to potential lease acreage — both on and offshore,” said Curtis Smith, a spokesperson for Shell, in an email. “But it’s too early to know, specifically, how the Draft 5YP [five-year plan] would play into future portfolio decisions.”</p>\n<p>Oil prices can <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/10/reuters-america-update-6-oil-prices-hit-fresh-highs-but-worries-grow-of-overheated-market.html\">still spike</a>, and even if demand holds steady, drillers still need to find new wells to replace the ones that are tapped out. Meanwhile, oil and gas infrastructure, from wells to pipelines to refineries, all cost billions of dollars and take years to build. </p>\n<p>And despite political tailwinds, just getting from the point of buying leases and securing permits to actually going out into the water to see what’s there can stretch up to 15 years, according to Gerard. </p>",

About two-thirds of those overdoses were linked to opioids.</p>\n<p>To understand how this crisis keeps growing, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180104.835958/full/?tr=y&auid=17509590\">an insightful map by amfAR</a>, an advocacy group dedicated to the fight against HIV/AIDS.<strong> </strong>The map shows three things: the availability of facilities that treat drug addiction, the facilities that provide at least one <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/20/15937896/medication-assisted-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-naltrexone\">medication for opioid addiction</a> (marked as MAT, or medication-assisted treatment, on the map), and the facilities that provide all three kinds of medications for opioid addiction.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0J8fcxhNcfrOx_LljprCdZ2yxE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10013747/MATFacilities2.gif\">\n<cite><a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180104.835958/full/?tr=y&auid=17509590&\">amfAR</a></cite>\n<figcaption>A map of drug addiction treatment facilities across the country that provide medications for opioid addiction.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Clearly, there are <em>a lot</em> of gaps in coverage. In <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180104.835958/full/?tr=y&auid=17509590\">a post on Health Affairs</a>, Austin Jones, Brian Honermann, Alana Sharp, and Gregorio Millett of amfAR looked at <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/substance-abuse-facilities-data-nssats/reports\">2016 data</a> from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and found that only 41.2 percent of the more than 12,000 drug addiction treatment facilities in the US offered at least one kind of medication for opioid addiction. Only 2.7 percent offered all three.</p>\n<p>These medications are widely considered by experts to be the gold standard in opioid addiction care. Studies, including systematic reviews of the research, have found that opioid addiction medications in general cut all-cause mortality among opioid addiction patients by <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.13193/full\">half</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1550\">more</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/idu/facts/MethadoneFin.pdf\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/use-medications-methadone-buprenorphine\">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/treatment_opioid_dependence/en/\">World Health Organization</a> acknowledge their medical value. That doesn’t mean these medications are for everyone (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/20/15937896/medication-assisted-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-naltrexone\">they’re not</a>), but there’s a lot of good evidence for their general efficacy.</p>\n<p>So it is pretty bad that a <em>majority</em> of addiction treatment facilities don’t provide access to any of these medications. It is similarly bad that even more of these facilities don’t offer access to more than one kind of medication; the individual types of medications don’t work for everyone — nothing in addiction treatment does — so it’s important to provide multiple options. </p>\n<p>We are, as a country, nowhere close to that goal.</p>\n<p>If the US isn’t making good use of even the bare minimum of evidence-based treatment, it’s no wonder the opioid crisis keeps getting worse.</p>\n<p>One caveat: The map likely understates the amount of addiction treatment that is available in some parts of the US. For one, physicians can gain the ability to prescribe buprenorphine through a special waiver, but those kinds of practices wouldn’t appear in a map solely dedicated to drug addiction treatment facilities. Still, <a href=\"http://opioid.amfar.org/indicator/bup_phys\">other data</a> collected by amfAR shows that there are big swathes of the country without doctors who can prescribe buprenorphine.</p>\n<p>There’s also other data that exposes America’s big gaps in addiction treatment. According to <a href=\"https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/\">a 2016 report</a> by the surgeon general, just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment. The report attributed the low rate to severe shortages in the supply of care, with some areas of the country lacking affordable options for any treatment — which can lead to waiting periods of weeks or even months.</p>\n<h3>The map exposes America’s inaction in the opioid epidemic</h3>\n<p>More than showing the specific counties and states that don’t have access to some kinds of treatment and medications, amfAR’s map shows that America isn’t truly serious about dealing with its opioid epidemic. </p>\n<p>Given that we know these medications are highly effective for opioid addiction, providing access to them should be the low-hanging fruit for dealing with a drug overdose epidemic fueled by opioids. Coverage remains sparse, and there’s been little attention to changing that.</p>\n<p>A major reason for that is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/12/18/16635910/opioid-epidemic-lessons\">stigma</a>. These medications are often characterized as “replacing one drug with another” — say, replacing heroin use with methadone use. </p>\n<p>This fundamentally misunderstands how addiction works. The problem is not drug use per se; most Americans, after all, use caffeine, alcohol, and medications without major problems. The problem is when drug use becomes a personal or social burden — for example, putting someone at risk of overdose or leading someone to commit crimes to obtain drugs. </p>\n<p>Medications for opioid addiction, by staving opioid withdrawal and cravings without leading to a significant risk of overdose, mitigate or outright eliminate those problems — treating the core concerns with addiction.</p>\n<p>Another reason for the treatment gap is a lack of federal attention. In the past few years, for example, the only new federal effort to dedicate a serious amount of money to the opioid crisis was the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/8/13858268/opioid-heroin-epidemic-congress-cures-act\">Cures Act</a>, which committed $1 billion over two years. </p>\n<p>Even that sum fell woefully short of the tens of billions <em>annually</em> that experts <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/1/15746780/opioid-epidemic-end\">argue</a> is necessary to deal with the opioid epidemic. For reference, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623005\">a 2016 study</a> estimated the total economic burden of prescription opioid overdose, misuse, and addiction at $78.5 billion in 2013, about a third of which was due to higher health care and addiction treatment costs. So even an investment of tens of billions could save money in the long run by preventing even more in costs.</p>\n<p>As Stanford drug policy expert Keith Humphreys <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/1/15746780/opioid-epidemic-end\">previously told me</a>, “Crises in a nation of 300 million people don’t go away for $1 billion. This is the biggest public health epidemic of a generation. Maybe it’s going to be worse than AIDS. So we need to go big.”</p>\n<p>America has not gone big, at least yet. So the opioid epidemic continues, killing tens of thousands of people in the process every single year.</p>\n<p>For more on the opioid epidemic, read <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/3/16079772/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdoses\">Vox’s explainer</a>.</p>",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951094078661414912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 10, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>William Alsup, the judge who issued <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000160-de32-da22-ad65-fffa4f5d0001\">the ruling defending DACA</a>, serves on the US District Court for the Northern District of California. But Trump’s insult is less about the District Court on which Alsup serves, and more about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate court to which the case proceeds now. (The district court is a trial court within the Ninth Circuit; the appellate court is one step higher on the ladder and oversees all individual districts.) </p>\n<p>The tweet is more than idle vituperation on the president’s part or a continuation of his diatribes about judges who rule against him. It reflects a widespread loathing of the Ninth Circuit, specifically, that has grown in conservative circles for years. The circuit’s appellate court, which covers California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii, Alaska, and Montana, has long been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25sfninth.html\">stereotyped as a liberal outlier</a>, prone to left-wing rulings that are frequently reversed by the Supreme Court on appeal.</p>\n<p>Rush Limbaugh calls it <a href=\"https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2017/02/09/keeping-a-sharp-eye-on-the-9th-circus/\">“the Ninth Circus”</a>; Newt Gingrich, while running for president in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2011/12/gingrich-abolish-anti-american-ninth-circuit-judges/\">called it “anti-American” and “dictatorial,” </a>and demanded its abolition. Trump himself has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/26/donald-trump/does-ninth-circuit-have-overturn-record-close-80/\">attacked the Ninth Circuit in the past</a> when other district judges have struck down versions of his Muslim travel ban and his restrictions on “sanctuary cities.”</p>\n<p>The circuit also makes news more than its peers due to its sheer size and reach. The Ninth Circuit is by far the largest federal appellate court, with 29 judges. (The Fifth Circuit, covering Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, is second, with 17.) The Ninth covers a population of 64.3 million people, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US,WA,CA,NV,AZ,OR/PST045217\">latest Census data</a>, or nearly 20 percent of the US. The 11th Circuit in Florida/Georgia/Alabama, which has the second-largest population of the circuits, only covers 36.3 million people.</p>\n<p>But its reputation as a massive outlier is somewhat undeserved. While the Ninth Circuit has some of the nation’s most famous liberal jurists, it has more ideological diversity than its critics give it credit for, and it’s evolved considerably from the 1980s, when its reputation took shape.</p>\n<h3>How liberal is the Ninth Circuit?</h3>\n<p>The Court’s reputation arguably derives from its transformation under President Jimmy Carter. While Carter was the only the fourth president to make no appointments to the Supreme Court, he did appoint <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-feuer-centrist-ninth-circuit-20160911-snap-story.html\">15 people to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, out of 23 judges total at the time. (It’s since expanded.)</p>\n<p>“Carter appointed some of the most liberal judges ever, to any court,” Alex Kozinski, a Reagan appointee and former chief judge of the Ninth Circuit who retired following <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/18/571677955/federal-judge-retires-in-the-wake-of-sexual-harassment-allegations\">repeated accusations of sexual harassment</a> last year, told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25sfninth.html\">New York Times in 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>Stephen Reinhardt, a Carter appointee who’s still serving, is widely viewed as one of the most liberal appellate judges on federal courts. He wrote the <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf\">Ninth Circuit’s opinion </a>striking down California’s same-sex marriage ban Proposition 8 in 2012, ruled that the Second Amendment <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silveira_v._Lockyer\">doesn’t recognize an individual right to bear arms</a>, and argued that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/02/us/high-court-to-decide-if-the-dying-have-a-right-to-assisted-suicide.html\">bans on assisted suicide are unconstitutional</a>.</p>\n<p>He also joined in <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/usfc/9/newdow_v_us.htm\">one of the court’s most notorious rulings</a> in 2002, in which Judge Alfred Goodwin wrote that the Pledge of Allegiance’s “under God” clause is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.</p>\n<p>But Reinhardt is increasingly a liberal outlier on the court. It also includes conservative luminaries like Diarmuid O’Scannlain (a Reagan appointee who took senior status in 2016) and Kozinski.</p>\n<p>Political science research attempting to quantify appellate judges’ politics also finds that the court has changed with time. A <a href=\"http://epstein.wustl.edu/research/JCS.pdf\">2007 look at Judicial Common Space scores</a> by political scientists Lee Epstein, Andrew Martin, Jeffrey Segal, and Chad Westerland found that the Ninth Circuit was among the most liberal appellate courts. But they also found that it shared the distinction with the Second Circuit, had a number of conservative judges, and grew sharply less liberal as a result of Reagan and George H.W. Bush’s appointments, before rebounding as a result of Clinton’s.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit’s trajectory over time is represented by the bottom left chart below; when the line goes lower, it means the court is getting more liberal; when it goes higher, it means the court is getting more conservative.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Judicial ideology scores based on Senators’ opinions\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X5ooQpW0387a09AlNZAobGgT8V4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10010779/jcs_chart.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"http://epstein.wustl.edu/research/JCS.pdf\">Epstein, Martin, Segal, Westerland 2007</a></cite>\n</figure>\n<p>But that analysis ended at 2000. A <a href=\"https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2432&context=law_and_economics\">more recent attempt to measure judicial ideology</a>, covering data up to 2014, relied on campaign donations by law clerks; the earlier study used the ideology of home-state senators who approved the judges’ appointments. </p>\n<p>While most law clerks, even for conservative judges, tend to be liberals who donate to Democratic politicians, conservative judges are still <em>likelier</em> to hire conservatives, and liberal ones likelier to hire liberals, so average clerk ideology can give a sense of where the different courts stand relative to each other.</p>\n<p>Political scientists and legal scholars Adam Bonica, Adam Chilton, Jacob Goldin, Kyle Rozema, and Maya Sen found that the court with the most liberal clerks was not the Ninth Circuit, but the First Circuit, headquartered in Boston; the Second Circuit, based in New York City, also hired more liberal clerks than the Ninth Circuit:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Ideology by court, as measured by clerks’ donations\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/357OhIsGMUDyrkm0aic7Cvz8YWE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10010947/clerk_ideology.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2432&context=law_and_economics\">Bonica, Chilton, Goldin, Rozema, Sen 2016</a></cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Conservatives like Trump like to make hay of the Ninth Circuit’s high rate of reversals by the Supreme Court. And it’s true: Most of its rulings that make it to the Supreme Court are overturned.</p>\n<p>But that’s true for literally every appellate court. After all, why would the Supreme Court accept an appeal if it didn’t think it was likely to overturn the lower court?</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Ninth Circuit is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/03/21/does-the-9th-circuit-court-overturn-80-percent-or-0-1-percent-of-its-cases/?utm_term=.2dafb107729c\">not the most frequently overturned circuit court.</a> From 2010 to 2015, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of the cases it took, and 79 percent from the Ninth Circuit. But it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/10/sean-hannity/no-9th-circuit-isnt-most-overturned-court-country-/\">reversed 87 percent of Sixth Circuit rulings</a>, and 85 percent of 11th Circuit rulings, both of which are notably more conservative courts than the Ninth.</p>\n<p>Intriguingly, the reversal rate doesn’t seem to have much to do with how liberal or conservative an appeals court is. The absolute lowest reversal rate goes to the 10th Circuit, a fairly moderate court, while second prize goes to the First Circuit (liberal) and the Fourth Circuit (conservative).</p>\n<p>Of course, these measures are about the appeals court, and despite Trump directing his ire at the circuit level, the DACA decision that set him up is at a district level. It’ll be a while yet before the case and related challenges to Trump’s DACA decision-making filter up to the Supreme Court and become part of the Ninth Circuit’s overall reversal (or nonreversal) statistics.</p>",

Paul Getty.</p>\n<p>The reshoots, which took place in late November, reportedly cost $10 million, and in December Scott <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/12/19/michelle-williams-mark-wahlberg-reshot-kevin-spaceys-all-money-scenes-free/966670001/\">told USA Today</a> that the budget was “expensive but not as expensive as you think” because “everyone did it for nothing.” While Plummer and the crew got paid, Scott refused payment, he said at the time, and so did star Michelle Williams.</p>\n<p>“I said I’d be wherever they needed me, whenever they needed me,” <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/12/19/michelle-williams-mark-wahlberg-reshot-kevin-spaceys-all-money-scenes-free/966670001/\">she told USA Today in December</a>. “And they could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted. Because I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort.” </p>\n<p>It turns out that Williams, who plays the lead character in the film, actually did get paid for the reshoots — a nominal fee of a little less than $1,000, about $80 per day (<a href=\"https://www.sagaftra.org/files/rate_sheet_theatrical_8_15_0.pdf\">about the minimum allowed by SAG-AFTRA</a>). Meanwhile, supporting actor Mark Wahlberg, who’s made no such statement regarding the reshoot or his fee, received a payout that eclipsed Williams’s by a factor of 1,500.</p>\n<p>On January 9, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/09/exclusive-wahlberg-paid-1-5-m-all-money-reshoot-williams-got-less-than-1-000/1018351001/\">USA Today reported</a> that Wahlberg earned $1.5 million for the reshoot, which constitutes 15 percent of the reshoot budget. That means Williams made less than 0.1 percent of Wahlberg’s salary for the reshoot. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg in All the Money in the World\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H6eetZ92Ph4N_bFsZBjunAmO_IA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9909593/allthemoney2.jpg\">\n<cite>TriStar Pictures</cite>\n<figcaption>Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg in <em>All the Money in the World.</em>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>That’s electrifying enough on its own; what’s more startling is that both actors are represented by the same agency, William Morris Endeavor, and Williams reportedly was not told that Wahlberg’s representatives had negotiated the hefty fee for him. </p>\n<p>While <em>All the Money in the World</em> is garnering fair to middling reviews from critics (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/21/16804720/all-the-money-in-the-world-review-ridley-scott-christopher-plummer-michelle-williams\">including me</a>), many reviews praise <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/all-the-money-in-the-world-movie-review.html\">Williams’s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/movies/all-the-money-in-the-world-review-christopher-plummer.html?_r=0\">Plummer’s</a> performances. Williams, Plummer, and Scott were all nominated for Golden Globes. But more than a few critics have <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/12/21/all-the-money-in-the-world-is-better-than-we-feared-not-as-good-as-we-hoped/\">pointed</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/all-the-money-in-the-world-should-have-been-the-christopher-plummer-show/549680/\">Wahlberg’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/all-the-money-in-the-world.html\">performance</a> as a low point in the movie. </p>\n<p>USA Today’s reporting came on the heels of <a href=\"http://time.com/5093087/golden-globes-2018-catt-sadler-wage-gap/\">pointed jabs</a> at the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/pay-gap-men-women-hollywood-growing/story?id=49376405\">gender pay gap</a> in Hollywood at Sunday’s Golden Globes. And while it’s not particularly surprising that the gap exists in this case — in August 2017, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2017/08/22/the-worlds-highest-paid-actors-2017-mark-wahlberg-leads-with-68-million/#10bd07c43f92\">Forbes reported</a> that Wahlberg was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, despite having had a very bad year at the box office — the size of the gap, the fact that it was apparently negotiated without Williams’s knowledge, the disparity between the two roles, and, most importantly, the fact that they are represented by the same agency all make the story especially damning. </p>\n<p>It’s not a good look for Wahlberg or for WME. And it’s one more data point to add to the call for wage equality in Hollywood.</p>",

The reports present a number of unverified allegations about Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia.</p>\n<p>The dossier paints Cohen as a key player in the Russia-Trump relationship, and includes (again, unverified) claims that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague in August 2016 to discuss how to pay Kremlin-linked hackers for targeting Clinton during the election.</p>\n<p>In his lawsuits, Cohen <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-cohen-trumps-personal-attorney-files-lawsuits-fusion/story?id=52247639\">alleges</a> that the Steele dossier was full of “false and defamatory” claims that caused “harm to his personal and professional reputation, current business interests, and the impairment of business opportunities.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuits are the latest move in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/14/16762840/mueller-trump-hannity-gaetz-jordan-perry-fire\">coordinated campaign</a> by conservatives in and out of government against special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. On Wednesday, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951109942685126656\">tweeted</a> his oft-repeated line that the Russia probe is “the single greatest Witch Hunt in American history.” Trump, however, has yet to sue anyone involved in releasing information about his potential Kremlin connections.</p>\n<p>BuzzFeed News says it plans to fight Cohen’s charges. “The dossier is, and continues to be, the subject of active investigations by Congress and intelligence agencies,” Matt Mittenthal, BuzzFeed News’s spokesperson, wrote to me in an email. “It was presented to two successive presidents, and has been described in detail by news outlets around the world. Its interest to the public is obvious. This is not the first time Trump’s personal lawyer has attacked the free press, and we look forward to defending our First Amendment rights in court.”</p>\n<p>Andy Wright, a law professor at Savannah Law School, thinks Cohen is unlikely to win his case. “Cohen would have to prove BuzzFeed knew what it published was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity,” Wright told me. “But he is likely to fail to show BuzzFeed wasn’t privileged to print the dossier under these circumstances, or that the reporters and editors acted with actual malice.”</p>\n<p>Outside of the courtroom, Cohen’s lawsuit will likely push Fusion GPS even further into the spotlight than it already is.</p>\n<h3>Why conservatives are mad at Fusion GPS</h3>\n<p>Many conservatives <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/14/16762840/mueller-trump-hannity-gaetz-jordan-perry-fire\">believe</a> the dossier is what led to the FBI’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the first place. They argue that because the dossier was paid for in part by people connected to the Clinton campaign, the Trump-Russia investigation that is based on the dossier is therefore a political hit job.</p>\n<p>That isn’t true. We know this in part because on Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is also conducting its own Trump-Russia investigation, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/9/16870106/simpson-testimony-transcript\">released</a> the transcript of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson’s 10 hours of testimony to the committee on August 22, 2017.</p>\n<p>Simpson <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/9/16870106/simpson-testimony-transcript\">said</a> that when Steele presented the dossier to the FBI, they told him that they were already looking into<strong> </strong>the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. In other words, the dossier was not what sparked the FBI investigation. </p>\n<p>Still, that controversy is likely to roil the halls of Congress. Meanwhile, Cohen wants to bring up his own issues with Fusion GPS and BuzzFeed News in the courtroom. That means this issue isn’t going anywhere.</p>",

It reads all over me. I could never lie very well to my parents. They always knew. Some people have that face. I guess I have that face. If people laugh, if they get enjoyment, if they say, ‘Oh, I can taste it, because of the way that your face is tasting it,’ that’s great! I’m happy to help.”</p>\n<p>Rosenthal is one of my favorite people to talk to in all of the entertainment industry because he combines true showbiz savvy with a real affection for making people laugh that reminds me of my funniest uncles growing up. So I was thrilled to have him join me for the <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/i-think-youre-interesting/episodes/dee5b778-4c84-404d-900b-92e6eed3fe9e\">latest episode</a> of my podcast, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/i-think-youre-interesting\"><em>I Think You’re Interesting</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Rosenthal could have easily rested on his laurels from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/9/27/13037234/everybody-loves-raymond-anniversary\"><em>Everybody Loves Raymond</em></a>, the classic comedy he created (based on the comedy of <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/i-think-youre-interesting/episodes/e9dbf852-43ee-4599-9697-ecdabf040e87\">Ray Romano</a>), which ran for nine seasons on CBS, from 1996 to 2005. The show stood as a beautiful example of the family sitcom at a time when it seemed to be on its last legs, and many members of its cast (four of whom won Emmys for their performances) and most of its writers have found huge success elsewhere since it went off the air.</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Everybody Loves Raymond deserves to be remembered as a TV classic&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/9/27/13037234/everybody-loves-raymond-anniversary&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>But in more recent years, Rosenthal has set his sights on making a show about two of his favorite things in the world: travel and food. In <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80146601\"><em>Somebody Feed Phil</em></a>, whose newest season debuts Friday, January 12, on Netflix, he visits the world’s best food cities and devours anything and everything he can find, both good and bad, and then his face lights up with everything he’s tasting in that moment. (The show was originally known as <em>I’ll Have What Phil’s Having </em>and produced for PBS. That season is <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80068216\">also available on Netflix</a>.)</p>\n<p>Because Rosenthal has worked both within the very strict confines of network television, and outside them, in the much looser world of streaming, I wanted to know whether he prefers the former or the latter. But instead of choosing one over the other, he answered my question with some of the best writing advice I’ve heard: It’s not what your superiors tell you you can get away with that matters; what matters is that you set your own standards for yourself. </p>\n<p>I’ll let him explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I love self-imposed discipline. What do I mean? On CBS, even from 1996 to 2005, when we were on, we actually got some notes, “Could you be a little hipper and edgier? Could you be a little hotter and sexier?” I’m, like, “Yeah, that’s Ray and me. Hotter and sexier. You got the right guys for this.”</p>\n<p>I felt like we could have been way more suggestive in our language. We could have said words that you hear all the time now in sitcoms. Number one, I thought it was easy. So did my crew and my staff and my writers, who I’d be nothing without. So did Ray. We knew that we could suggest something — what was the cleverest way to do it? What was the way that the adult would get it, and the kid wouldn’t? Let’s aim over the kids’ heads, so that the family can watch together, and so that grandma isn’t offended.</p>\n<p>That was a conscious choice. There’s a show we did about a sculpture. [Season six episode <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0574189/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">“Marie’s Sculpture,”</a> for which writer Jennifer Crittenden received an Emmy nomination.] Marie makes a sculpture. It looks like a woman’s part of the anatomy. We could have said the word for that. But what if it was almost like a comedic challenge? What if we never had to say it? To me, the show is funnier for it. </p>\n<p>On Netflix, they say “around an hour.” But they say if it’s 15 minutes short, that’s okay. If it’s 15 minutes long, that’s okay. ... It literally doesn’t matter to them. So, self-imposed. I think we should be under an hour. I think maybe there will be exceptions, where there’s so much great stuff, we have to be over an hour. But I’m saying as good as the show is now, I’m looking at cuts. What can we cut to get it under an hour? I think that’s important. </p>\n<p>You want to be as tight and good as possible, because you can become indulgent and say, “Oh, yes, just me eating is fascinating to watch.” No! It’s not. There has to be more to it than that. If it was just me eating, I think you’d get bored. There has to be more. It has to be funny. It has to be entertaining. It has to be beautiful. I want it to be — a very modest goal — the most entertaining food and travel show in the world. That’s my goal. I’m going for it. How many shots do you get?</p>\n<p>On <em>Raymond</em>, I felt, “How many shots do we get?” It has to be good! I want to make it good for us, not because of some ratings or something. We live and die by our work. Your name is on it. At the end of the day, you have this DVD, this tape, of your show. You want to be able to show it to people later? You want your kids to be able to show it to their friends? </p>\n<p>That’s what’s in the back of our heads. I used to tell people, “Yeah, I’m doing <em>Everybody Loves Raymond</em> for CBS, but in the back of my mind, it’s for Nick at Nite.” And guess what? With that goal in mind, it’s now on TV Land. It lasted because we decided to make something that might be worthy of lasting. It’s not just, “Let’s get those ratings right now.” We’ll have a sexy thing and make a sexy joke and be a little vulgar even. That’ll get attention. Yeah, you’ll win the battle, but you lose the war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Listen to the <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/i-think-youre-interesting/episodes/dee5b778-4c84-404d-900b-92e6eed3fe9e\">full episode</a> to hear more from Rosenthal about producing a show that films all over the world, creating timeless television, and what shows are making him laugh now.</p>\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://art19.com/shows/i-think-youre-interesting/episodes/dee5b778-4c84-404d-900b-92e6eed3fe9e/embed?primary_color=%234f7177&theme=light-gray-blue\"></iframe></div>\n<p><em>To hear more interviews with fascinating people from the world of arts and culture — from powerful showrunners to web series creators to documentary filmmakers — </em><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/i-think-youre-interesting\"><em><strong>check out the </strong></em><strong>I Think You’re Interesting</strong><em><strong> archives</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>",

But we as a society somehow reached a new low Tuesday afternoon after Trump staged a pointless, unproductive televised discussion of immigration policy with several members of Congress and successfully earned media plaudits for the feat of not suffering from any obvious symptoms of dementia. </p>\n<p>I wish I were exaggerating, but this literally happened. </p>\n<p>Emily Stephenson, a Politico editor, tweeted that the session was “a rebuke of reports that [Trump] is less than fully capable” while promoting a Louis Nelson story that congratulated the president for his ability to recall the names of the participants in the meeting he organized.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump's unusually public negotiating session seemed like a rebuke of reports that he is less than fully capable. <a href=\"https://t.co/0gjVexEifw\">https://t.co/0gjVexEifw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/louisjnelson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@louisjnelson</a></p>— Emily Stephenson (@ewstephe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewstephe/status/950826160593801217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>I asked what about the meeting demonstrated that Trump is capable, and she replied that she meant, quite literally, that the meeting seemed to show that Trump knows the names of several members of Congress.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Story doesn’t say he was or wasn’t impressive, just that he wasn’t repeating stories and forgetting names like the book indicated.</p>— Emily Stephenson (@ewstephe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewstephe/status/950829166525603841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>This tendency reached comical new heights via David Martosko of the Daily Mail, who first congratulated Trump for a commanding display the likes of which we’d never seen from Barack Obama before swiftly retreating to the contention that Trump had proven he’s not senile.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Y'all can stop reminding me about Obama in 2010. Those were great events too. In this context, though, Trump's seemed calculated to push back about all the dementia claims. It's a different context.</p>— David Martosko (@dmartosko) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmartosko/status/950811488809357312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>This tendency has reached new heights (or maybe lows) thanks to Michael Wolff’s new book <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/1/9/16860598/michael-wolff-fire-fury-donald-trump-book\"><em>Fire and Fury</em></a><em>, </em>which is squarely focused on unflattering assessments of the president’s fitness for office from members of his own staff. But while I cannot believe this actually has to be said, “not senile” is not an appropriate bar to set for the president of the United States, and an afternoon of lucidity doesn’t even prove Trump meets this bar. </p>\n<p>An effective president doesn’t need to understand all the details of every policy issue under the sun, but he needs to understand <em>some</em> of them (the ones he’s made the focus of his administration, for example), and he needs to demonstrate a capacity to get up to speed<em> </em>on the whole range of often unexpected problems that end up landing on the president’s desk. The meeting yesterday was a clear indictment of Trump in this regard. </p>\n<p>The issue at hand was the fate of hundreds of thousands of DREAMers whose lives Trump capriciously threw into chaos last year. Time is running out for these people, whose welfare has been jeopardized through his own action. And <em>by far</em> the most important takeaway from the president’s day of DACA is that he is doing this for no good reason and, indeed, barely seems to understand what’s happening. </p>\n<h3>Trump’s chitchat proves nothing</h3>\n<p>As anyone who’s ever watched an elderly relative decline mentally can tell you, a discrete spell of lucidity is hardly proof that nothing is wrong. Just the previous night, for example, Trump <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42619347\">appeared to forget the lyrics to “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</a> Others think the issue was simply that Trump doesn’t hear very well. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For those grousing about Trump seemingly not knowing the words to the national anthem: 1) He's hard of hearing and 2) down on the field, the sound bounces around a lot and it's hard to decipher the music. Singing along wouldn't be easy for him.</p>— Anthony Zurcher (@awzurcher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/950542355886682113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Studies show, however, that hearing loss in the elderly is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/well/vision-and-hearing-loss-are-tied-to-cognitive-decline.html?_r=0\">strongly correlated with cognitive decline</a>, so I’m not sure this really gets Trump out of the woods. </p>\n<p>Those touting Trump’s ability to remember the names of the members of Congress he was talking to, meanwhile, should probably note that everyone was seated around the table with name placards. So really nothing at all was demonstrated about the president’s memory — according to Trump himself, it’s “one of the great memories of all time” but we’re long past the point where we expect him to conduct himself with a modicum of honesty — beyond his ability to read. </p>\n<p>All that said, to be even arguing about this is well beyond the point of absurd. The thing we saw on full display at the meeting was that when it comes to immigration policy — the closest thing Trump has to a signature issue — the president of the United States has zero substantive command of the topic. </p>\n<h3>Trump has no idea what he’s talking about</h3>\n<p>The key exchange of the afternoon came when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked the president if he might like to completely abandon his administration’s stated position on the issue under discussion and, instead, adopt the Democratic position.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here's the incredible moment where Trump initially agrees to Feinstein's suggestion that they do a clean DACA bill, before being corrected by Republicans about what she was actually suggesting. <a href=\"https://t.co/RaXAQAi8JF\">pic.twitter.com/RaXAQAi8JF</a></p>— David Mack (@davidmackau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmackau/status/950798611587174401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>“What about a clean DACA bill now,” she asked “with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure like we did, you know, back when Kennedy was here?”</p>\n<p>At this point, you would expect a Republican Party politician to restate the Republican Party’s position on the issue — that action for DACA recipients should be paired with some form of border security measures, and that no kind of “comprehensive” reform makes sense until such time as total border security has been achieved. One might even expect a Republican Party politician to offer some kind of argument in favor of this position, an explanation of its merits. </p>\n<p>Trump, instead, just said he agreed with Feinstein! “I have no problem — I think that’s basically what Dick is saying,” he said, referring to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), who, as a Democrat, agrees with Feinstein’s position rather than Trump’s. Except Trump seemed to think he, Durbin, and Feinstein were all on the same page: “We’re going to come up with DACA, we’re going to do DACA, and then we can start with phase two, which would be comprehensive.”</p>\n<p>It was then left to Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to gently correct the president and say, “Mr. President, you need to be clear, though. I think what Senator Feinstein is asking there — when we talk about just DACA, we don’t want to be back here two years later. You have to have security.”</p>\n<p>Trump, confused, said, “I think that’s what she’s saying.”</p>\n<p>McCarthy, like a real politician with some kind of cursory grasp of what’s happening in American politics, again corrected the president: “No, I think she’s saying something different.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, McCarthy’s position prevailed and the discussion broke up with no meaningful progress having occurred beyond Trump’s<strong> </strong>line about a “clean” DACA deal getting mysteriously <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fifty-five-minutes-at-the-table-trump-tries-to-negotiate-and-prove-stability/2018/01/09/0b41af64-f570-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html\">omitted</a> from the White House transcript, as the Washington Post reported yesterday. Republicans and Democrats remained in their respective corners, and for Republicans this is apparently good enough. Trump may not have any grasp of what his own party — indeed, his own administration — is doing, but he defers to congressional Republicans on policy matters and is probably not suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Congratulations, America!</p>\n<h3>Trump is harming the country </h3>\n<p>There’s something more than a little pointless about the mental fitness debate. Trump is, for better or worse, now pursuing an utterly orthodox Republican Party approach on every policy issue under the sun. Ultimately, Trump’s slothful work habits and boundless incuriosity are more a problem for that party’s leaders than for anyone else. If their considered judgment is that this policy agenda is better pursued by a lazy, ignorant cable news addict than by Mike Pence, that’s really their problem. </p>\n<p>The agenda itself, however, is a problem. </p>\n<p>And lost in the shuffle of whether we’re supposed to be impressed that Trump remembers Feinstein’s name is “Dianne” or appalled that he can’t remember what his position on DACA is, we have the fact that Trump’s position on DACA is appalling. </p>\n<p>Trump canceled DACA supposedly out of scrupulous worry that extending deportation protection and work permits to this group of immigrants exceeded the Obama administration’s legitimate constitutional authority. On a policy level, however, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/economic-fiscal-impact-repealing-daca\">Ike Brannon and Logan Albright of the Cato Institute</a> have concluded that “deporting the approximately 750,000 people currently in the DACA program would be over $60 billion to the federal government along with a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade.” </p>\n<p>Of course, there is no realistic way that all 750,000 DACA recipients will be deported, but losing legal authorization to live and work in the United States will hurt them nonetheless by forcing them out of the legitimate labor market and into the shadows. A report compiled this summer by the Center for American Progress concluded that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/08/28/437956/daca-recipients-economic-educational-gains-continue-grow/\">obtaining DACA protection raised recipients’ wages by 69 percent on average</a>, and it stands to reason that losing it would cause a large-scale reversal with concomitant negative effects for GDP growth, productivity, and tax collection.</p>\n<p>With the economy finally enjoying low unemployment (as Trump likes to brag), there is no conceivable upside to deporting a large group of young, well-educated workers who are contributing meaningfully to the American economy. Which is precisely why Republicans keep teasing their willingness to offer them some legislative relief. But instead of doing the right thing for the country, the GOP is hung up on the idea of using the DACA issue as leverage to jam up the Democrats and either extract some concessions on other immigration issues or force the party into an internecine argument about whether they are doing enough for the DREAMers. </p>\n<p>This may or may not work in the end, and Trump may or may not understand what’s going on, but what’s <em>clearly</em> true is that it’s already harming hundreds of thousands of people and will only continue to harm them — and the public at large — more the longer it continues. It’s cynical, it’s appalling, and it fundamentally does Trump no favors to insist that he’s mentally acute and fully in command of the agenda he’s unleashed. </p>",

These disruptions have led in turn to the questioning of political forms of organization — although in the earlier period, the questioning came mostly from the left rather than from the right.</p>\n<p>We therefore have much to gain from reading the most important political and economic authors of the pre-WWI era. </p>\n<p>In fact, those century-old writings are in many ways as useful for understanding the current situation, and in some cases <em>more </em>useful<em>,</em> than the work of today’s intellectuals.</p>\n<p>Granted, any comparison of the intellectual output of the two periods will be highly subjective. There were thousands of authors then, and there are millions today. The world population in 1900 was about 1.7 billion people, less than a quarter of today’s, literacy in the world was vastly inferior, and the number of media outlets was immensely lower. Statistically, we are comparing one rather small sample with one enormous sample. </p>\n<p>What’s more, much mediocre work from the past has slipped into oblivion, creating a kind of hindsight bias.</p>\n<h3>The older generation of social scientists considered social structure more broadly</h3>\n<p>These caveats aside, what advantages do the writers of the turn of the 20th century offer? The main difference and prime advantage, I think, lies in their holistic approach to economic and political analysis. It was holistic in the sense that they discussed the structural features of capitalism: social relations between capital owners and wage workers, distribution of national income between capital and labor, formation of the social elite. In contrast, today’s discussion was until recently dominated by attempts to apply small fixes and to keep questions about the systemic structure off the table.</p>\n<p>The recent narrower approach is, at least in economics, a product of two developments. The first, dating to the 1950s or so, involves a systematic disregard for the differences in people’s positions in the process of production: their agency, power, and material inequality. Gradually, the discussion of classes, so salient in early economics, disappeared, and all individuals were considered simply as “economic agents” maximizing their utility under the conditions of given endowments. </p>\n<p>The second trend, exacerbating the first, was the triumphalism that spread after the end of communism. Social scientists came to believe that the fundamental problem of how a human society should be organized was solved: liberal democracy politically and capitalism economically. Scholars embraced the idea that the structural edifice of society was immutable, and that only small homeopathic fixes were needed to solve the outstanding problems. </p>\n<p>Many people — though still too few — are awakening to the fact that the problems of rich Western democracies, and to a lesser extent of emerging market economies, are fundamental. This is why it is useful to go back to the old masters, who had no doubts that the problems they faced were profound, even if many of them proposed solutions that made some of these problems worse. Fortunately, we can now sift through the proposed solutions and discard the mistakes.</p>\n<p>Here are some authors and works I’ve been revisiting that discuss issues that manifestly remain as relevant today as a century ago. Let’s focus on three issues in particular: globalization and the class cleavages it creates within rich countries, threats to democracy, and migration.</p>\n<h3><strong>Inequality</strong></h3>\n<p>In several works, but most famously in his 1902 book <em>Imperialism</em>, the English economist John Hobson made the following prescient point: High domestic inequality in rich countries made domestic aggregate demand weak but generated large investible resources in the hands of what we would today call “the top 1 percent.” These funds were invested abroad, lowering demand for domestic labor. </p>\n<p>We face a similar problem today: High inequality has generated huge stashes of capital looking for profitable investment opportunities. The owners of capital make profits either by lending to people who may not be able to repay the loans (one cause of the global financial crisis) or by outsourcing and investing abroad (and, as in Hobson’s time, keeping demand for domestic labor low). </p>\n<p>Hobson correctly highlighted the conflict of interest between the rich elites and workers that persists to this day. </p>\n<p>The solutions are either a reduction in inequality or protectionism including capital controls. Yet countries today remain frozen by indecision on this front. Protectionism clashes with the long-held tenets of globalization, and no OECD country is contemplating measures to reduce income and wealth inequality. Most economists and politicians appear to be hoping that the problem will disappear by itself, or that trickle-down economics, many times tried and failed, will <em>this time</em> do the trick.</p>\n<p>Surveying the same early-20th-century economic landscape, Rudolf Hilferding, a leading figure in the Social Democratic Party during the Weimar Republic, described in his <em>Financial Capital</em>, published in 1919, a symbiosis at the top between large industrial complexes and banks. (The work grew out of his prewar thinking.) He was concerned about rising monopolization and cartelization of the economy — trends noted as well by Marxist authors including Vladimir Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, and Nikolai Bukharin. Concentration of economic power and “personal union” among the elite ensured a political stranglehold by the rich: The state was increasingly becoming a political tool used by the rich to maintain and increase economic power. </p>\n<p>We see clear similarities to today — a time when the new information technology giants control the lion’s share of their markets, avoid paying taxes, and aggressively move to buy ownership of the media companies and to fund politicians. </p>\n<h3>Democracy</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Max Weber, circa 1917.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3YdGr-_yllingwDZ9RqUx35aFlk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10010485/GettyImages_541488545.jpg\">\n<cite>Archiv Gerstenberg/ullstein bild/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Max Weber, circa 1917.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Which brings us to the fragility of democracy. Consider so-called crony capitalism — long a feature of emerging market economies and the subject of renewed interest in the United States. In <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,</em> published in 1904, the sociologist Max Weber accurately diagnosed this as “politically determined capitalism.” He developed the idea in his posthumous <em>Economy and Society</em>: “[P]olitical capitalism exists,” he writes, “ … wherever there [is] tax farming, the profitable provision of state’s political needs, war, piracy, large-scale usury, and colonization.” </p>\n<p>For “tax farming” today, look no further than Luxembourg luring Amazon’s business with a low tax rate. For satisfaction of political needs through extravagantly overbilled public works, look at Arkady Rotenberg, a judo partner of Vladimir Putin, whose company (which had never built a single bridge!) was contracted to make a very complicated bridge between Russia and Crimea. America’s wars in Iraq and elsewhere have bolstered many companies that depend on government contracts. </p>\n<p>These old-school writers were also very astute about the political science of demagoguery, which Weber defined as manipulation of the electorate through proffering of unrealistic promises. He thought the rise of demagogues was specific to Western political culture; it was a potentially dangerous side effect of democracy. Demagoguery appeared, according to Weber, first in the Mediterranean city-states and then spread to Western parliamentary systems through the role of party leaders. </p>\n<p>There is little doubt that Brexit would not have happened without demagoguery. Demagoguery is also the way Viktor Orbán (Hungary’s prime minister), Jaroslaw Kaczyński (leader of Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice Party), Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Turkey’s president), and Vladimir Putin are able to rule using their overwhelming parliamentary majorities. All but Orbán are in effect controlling the majorities informally, able to dominate both the executive and the legislative branches despite not serving as prime minister. </p>\n<p>The source of their power — given their high popularity ratings and successful identification with themes of national grandeur and the undoing of actual or supposed victimizations — is much better understood as demagoguery than autocracy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Migration</strong></h3>\n<p>Finally, let’s look at migration, another feature that we share with the world of a century ago. Not only was capital moving then as now, but people were moving, too — probably even more than today in relative terms (that is, taking the global population into account). Such movements provoked strong negative reactions in the receiving countries, notably among trade unions. As a result, those countries, including the US, Australia, and Canada, outright banned some kinds of migrants or imposed heavy “landing fees,” very similar to today’s fees paid to buy citizenship.</p>\n<p>The resistance to migration was not limited to those who might have been in wage competition with migrants. Moral and cultural arguments against migration were also common, not only among the partisans of eugenics (like Schumpeter) and racial purity (like Cecil Rhodes) but even among top economists. Here is England’s Alfred Marshall, the most influential economist of the time, opining on the role of migrants in 1898, in a book that was then the equivalent of Samuelson’s <em>Economics</em> or Greg Mankiw’s <em>Principles of Economics (</em>Marshall wrote a book with the same title):</p>\n<blockquote><p>For immigrants coming from a country in which the standard of living is low, to one in which it is high, may injure [the second country] materially as well as morally even though they carry in their own persons a good deal of invested capital, and produce in the country of their adoption, more than they consume. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Today’s economic analysis of migration is much more nuanced and less racist than its forebears, but it is also significantly out of step with public opinion, especially in Europe. By focusing solely on the economic calculus of benefits and costs of migration, which is overwhelmingly favorable, do not economists overlook other factors that enter into people’s preferences and guide their opinions, even if these factors may often be nationalistic or borderline racist? And don’t they reduce their own influence by doing so?</p>\n<p>Older writers cannot provide us with ready-made answers to the questions that are specific to today. And things are indeed changing for the better in the intellectual sphere — thanks to the works of authors such as Thomas Piketty, Ed Wolff, Joe Stiglitz, Dani Rodrik, and Martin Gilens, who are willing to ask bigger questions (and answer them with much better data than previously existed).</p>\n<p>But the older writers can help us realize that the problems we face are not all new or unique. They supply us also with forgotten points of view that better illuminate the trade-offs we face in politics and economics. Most importantly, they might show us what we should <em>not </em>do, in order that this era of globalization does not end up like the previous one — in the carnage of war.</p>\n<p><em>Branko Milanovic is </em><em>a </em><em>visiting presidential professor and senior scholar in the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality, at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

I haven’t read them, I’ve heard about them,” he said. “In my life, I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I’ve done. I have to do that to maintain my well-being. I do it whenever I know there’s something wrong or that needs to be changed; I make it a point to do it. The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate. But I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn’t have a voice for so long. I don’t want to shut them down in any way. It’s, I think, a good thing, and I support it.”</p>\n<p>Franco’s reputation was not squeaky clean to begin with. In 2014, a then-35-year-old Franco <a href=\"http://gawker.com/james-franco-tried-to-hook-up-with-a-17-year-old-on-ins-1557491436\">tried to arrange a hookup</a> with a 17-year-old girl on Instagram. (Said hookup never actually happened.) <a href=\"http://gawker.com/james-franco-says-he-did-hit-on-a-teen-because-social-1558165191\">He later admitted to the incident</a> on <em>Live </em><em>W</em><em>ith Kelly and Michael</em>, saying, “I’m guess I’m, you know, embarrassed, and I guess I’m just a model of how social media is tricky. What I’ve learned, because I’m new to this, is just that you don’t know who’s on the other end.” Screencaps of the conversation provided by the girl in question show her informing Franco that she is “nearly 18.”</p>\n<p>On <em>The Howard Stern Show</em>, <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/fr/news/537462/james-franco-on-trying-to-pick-up-a-17-year-old-i-m-not-going-to-high-schools-looking-for-dates\">Franco later added</a>, “Seventeen is legal in New York, but that being said, it’s still pretty damn young. … They make it out like I’m pursuing young women. I’m not going to high schools looking for dates. I’m leaving my work and they’re coming there. So, I’m seeing attractive women.”</p>\n<p>So when Franco appeared at the Golden Globes on Sunday night wearing a Time’s Up pin, hackles were raised. The sight of Franco being feted amid <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861532/black-gowns-golden-globes-red-carpet\">a large and visible protest</a> against the sexist mistreatment of women in Hollywood inspired several women to come forward with<strong> </strong>new accusations against him — most prominently actress Violet Paley, who accused Franco of sexual assault on Twitter.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cute <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIMESUP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TIMESUP</a> pin James Franco.

Why is James Franco allowed in? Said too much.”</p>\n<p>Sheedy’s comments were the only ones Franco addressed specifically on <em>The Late Show</em>. “First of all, I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy,” he said. “I directed her in a play off Broadway. I had nothing but a great time with her. Total respect for her. I have no idea why she was upset. She took the tweets down. I don’t know. I can’t speak for her, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>Franco’s quasi-apology slash denial is fairly par for the course when it comes to the apologies we’ve seen so far from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/8/16751712/late-night-seth-meyers-apologize-sexual-harassment-amber-ruffin\">other powerful men accused of sexual misconduct</a>, especially in its emphasis on his own allegedly sterling morality. As awards season continues, and Franco’s publicity tour with it, it remains to be seen whether this apology will need to develop further.</p>",

It’s a preliminary injunction — an order to temporarily stop a government policy, while the courts hash out the question of whether the policy is legal and constitutional. That makes it, by its nature, temporary.</p>\n<p>Preliminary injunctions are issued when the judge believes it’s likely that the policy in question will ultimately be struck down in court — and when the cost of allowing the policy to go into effect is large and irreversible enough that it’s best not to risk it. </p>\n<p>In this case, of course, the policy already <em>has </em>gone into effect (despite the tendency of the Trump administration and others to say that DACA “expires” on March 5). </p>\n<p>In September, the Department of Homeland Security stopped allowing people to apply for an initial two-year grant of protection from deportation and work permit under DACA. It prevented people whose current work permits expired after March 5, 2018, from applying for renewal. </p>\n<p>The department set a deadline of October 5 for anyone whose work permit was going to expire in the next six months to apply for one last renewal — a deadline that roughly 22,000 DACA recipients missed. (Many, it turns out, because of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/13/16772630/daca-expire-ice-arrest-deport\">Postal Service delays</a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16650400/daca-renewal-deadline-rejected-lockbox-uscis\">narrow deadline interpretations by US Citizenship and Immigration Services.</a>)</p>\n<p>Judge Alsup’s order doesn’t fully reanimate the DACA program. It does not allow people who had not previously applied for DACA — even if they became eligible (say, by turning 15) after the Trump administration stopped accepting new applications on September 5 — to apply. It doesn’t allow those who currently have DACA to apply for “advance parole,” or the ability to leave the United States and come back.</p>\n<p>The order says the Trump administration has to make it possible for people who already were approved for DACA to apply for two-year renewals of their work permits and deportation protections. </p>\n<p>That applies to the estimated 11,000 people whose work permits have already expired since September. It also applies to immigrants whose work permits are set to expire in the coming weeks or months but who didn’t get a chance to reapply under the administration’s rules.</p>\n<h3>This doesn’t mean DACA recipients are home free if they just reapply now</h3>\n<p>Tuesday night’s order <em>doesn’t </em>say that the Trump administration has to start accepting DACA renewal applications again immediately.</p>\n<p>US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that administered DACA, has to provide public notice about how people can apply for renewals again — and it has to do so in a “reasonable” amount of time. That’s not a specific timeline; it just means that if the plaintiffs think USCIS is dragging its feet, they can go back to Judge Alsup and argue that the government is violating the order by not being “reasonable.”</p>\n<p>It’s not at all clear how long it might take USCIS to do that. It’s only just finished assessing the scope of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16650400/daca-renewal-deadline-rejected-lockbox-uscis\">Postal Service errors that resulted in more than 1,900 applications getting rejected as “late,”</a> six weeks after the problem was brought to light. </p>\n<p>It’s also not clear how long Alsup’s ruling will stand. The government has the ability to appeal it to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and from there to the Supreme Court. Or it can ask the Ninth Circuit to put a hold (a “stay”) on the injunction. The government’s odds of getting a hold are decent — especially because the Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/us/politics/supreme-court-daca-documents.html\">already slapped down one order by Alsup</a> in this case (an attempt to force the government to turn over documents about its decision-making process for ending DACA).</p>\n<p>That puts people who might be eligible to reapply for DACA now in a bind. Do they submit renewal applications — including a $495 check — as quickly as possible, in hopes that USCIS will start accepting them even before it puts out formal guidance? Or do they wait, so they don’t accidentally violate rules for renewal that USCIS hasn’t yet set? And what happens if they send in their renewal applications but another court overturns Alsup’s order before they’ve heard back?</p>\n<p>It’s an extremely difficult risk calculus — the sort that requires guidance from an immigration lawyer to suss out. But even immigration lawyers are telling their clients, and the public, different things. </p>\n<p>The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that “our understanding is that the administration must grant renewal status to DACA grantees.” But Marielena Hincapie of the National Immigration Law Center said that because “there isn’t yet a mechanism” for US Citizenship and Immigration Services to accept those renewals, DACA recipients <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/daca-injunction-what-a-federal-judges-ruling-means-for-dreamers/2018/01/10/ecb5d492-f60c-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html?utm_term=.856a44f6990c\">“can’t go back and renew today.”</a></p>\n<p>The upshot for the people who might be affected by Tuesday night’s injunction is that it replaces the certainty that their DACA will end with a very fragile possibility that they can renew it.</p>\n<h3>Judge Alsup ruled that the Trump administration needed to show its work better before ending a program that people relied on</h3>\n<p>Legally, Judge Alsup found, there’s reason to believe that the decision to end DACA was made so hastily that it could violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the actions of federal agencies.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the legal argument against DACA was largely based on the claim that President Obama violated the APA by creating the program. But as far as Alsup is concerned, that’s not relevant to the question of whether Trump violated the APA in <em>ending </em>it.</p>\n<p>For one thing, Alsup writes, “the agency’s decision to rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise.” The administration said it was ending the program because DACA was unconstitutional — if Republican state officials followed through with a threat to sue over DACA’s constitutionality, the administration didn’t think it could win. </p>\n<p>“Our collective wisdom,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in September, “is that the policy is vulnerable to the same legal and constitutional challenges that the courts recognized” when the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stopped an attempted expansion of the DACA program, and a related deferred action program, from going into effect in 2015.</p>\n<p>Because the Trump administration acted preemptively to kill DACA, the courts never actually hashed out the question of DACA’s constitutionality. Alsup found the administration made a false assumption that DACA wouldn’t be constitutional. </p>\n<p>“One way an agency action can be deemed arbitrary” under the law, said Josh Rosenthal of the National Immigration Law Center (who is litigating a similar case over DACA in New York), “is if the legal premise is erroneous.” Alsup’s injunction finds that might have happened here.</p>\n<p>That finding opens the door for the Trump administration to actually hash out the constitutionality of DACA in court — and if it ultimately persuades the courts that the program was unconstitutional, it would be able to proceed with killing it. The second argument Alsup makes, according to Rosenthal, would be harder for the Trump administration to respond to.</p>\n<p>“It’s established law,” says Rosenthal, “that if people have built reliance around a government policy” — even if that policy isn’t formalized as a regulation, as DACA wasn’t — “the agency has to take into account before changing the policy.” Even if the agency thinks the policy is illegal, it has to consider that “reliance interest.”</p>\n<p>Ever since DACA went into effect in 2012, critics of the program from left and right have argued that it was by design a temporary stopgap that could be reversed by a future administration; but in practice, advocates argued, DACA recipients (not to mention their employers, families, schools, etc.) had been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/14/16752114/daca-children-us-citizens\">able to rely on the security the program offered them</a> for five years.</p>\n<p>The “reliance interest” doesn’t require the administration to keep doing something illegal — it just requires the administration to consider that impact. And Judge Alsup wrote on Tuesday that it’s probable the Trump administration didn’t consider it enough.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Rosenthal says, a loss on “reliance interest” grounds could force a government agency to go back to square one and redo the decision-making process. The question, of course, is what the decision-making process to end DACA actually was — and whether the government wouldn’t just come to the same conclusion even if it had taken “reliance” into consideration.</p>\n<h3>DACA is still very fragile</h3>\n<p>The injunction ordering the government to partially resurrect DACA comes in the midst of plodding negotiations in Congress over a permanent replacement for the program. Those negotiations were kick-started when the administration announced it would bring DACA to a close — and they’ve proceeded with an eye toward the March 5 “deadline.” </p>\n<p>But Alsup’s ruling could send a signal to some in Congress that the March 5 deadline isn’t as much a problem as they’d feared, since people whose work permits are set to expire on March 6 should now (pending USCIS instructions) be able to renew them. </p>\n<p>That’s an outcome that the advocates who just won a victory with Alsup’s injunction clearly dread. “The uncertainty illustrates why there’s still an urgency for Congress to act,” Rosenthal said. </p>\n<p>Ironically, the arguments made by DACA advocates now are strikingly similar to arguments made by critics of the program when it was in effect. They’re saying that an executive branch program, one that can be started up or shut down at any time with the stroke of a judge’s pen, shouldn’t be a substitute for legislation: something that is permanent both in the law and for the people who benefit from it. </p>\n<p>While DACA was in effect, even people who thought it usurped the authority of Congress weren’t agitating for Congress to act to protect DREAMers. The pressure wasn’t on until DACA was brought to an end. </p>\n<p>And with so many obstacles to a congressional DACA deal already, it’s still not clear whether Judge Alsup’s fragile, partial, likely short-lived ruling will be taken by Congress as a permanent reprieve.</p>",

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) ignored the objections of her Republican colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee and released the full transcript of <a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf\">Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson’s extensive congressional testimony</a> about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16845704/steele-dossier-russia-trump\">Christopher Steele’s famous dossier on Donald Trump and Russia</a>. </p>\n<p>Today, President Trump woke up angry and tweeting about the situation — pretending that there’s something illegal about this and hoping people will ignore the key takeaway from the testimony, which is that conservatives in Congress have been misleading people about the origins of the FBI investigation into Trump and Russia.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951106475254059008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 10, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>No law was broken here. Simpson testified in a closed session, but he wasn’t discussing classified information (he’s not a government official) or anything about anyone’s private life (there are some minor redactions to ensure this). And Simpson had already publicly called for the full release of his testimony. </p>\n<p>What Feinstein violated was the normal rules of Senate decorum, which Republicans had been using to cover up a key point that debunks some of their own talking points about this matter.</p>\n<p>The key takeaway is that the FBI was already investigating potential links between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russian government <em>before</em> they got the Steele dossier. The hearing lasted for hours, and the transcript is extremely long and fairly tedious. But Simpson does clearly state that when Steele spoke to the FBI about his findings, the bureau “believed Chris’s information might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization.”</p>\n<p>That sounds like Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/30/16833954/george-papadopoulos-trump-times\"><strong>according to a recent report in the New York Times</strong></a>, accidentally kicked off the Trump–Russia investigation by telling Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russia had political dirt on Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, after a night of heavy drinking in May 2016. </p>\n<p>Conservatives have recently been pushing a theory that the basis for the FBI investigation was an opposition research document compiled at the behest of Clinton’s campaign. Simpson’s testimony seems to confirm the Times account and thereby debunk a conservative counternarrative that places the dossier itself at the center of the story.</p>\n<h3>Wait, who are these people?</h3>\n<p>Glenn Simpson is one of the co-founders of Fusion GPS, a “strategic intelligence” firm that was hired first by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news publication, and later by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to conduct opposition research on Donald Trump. Fusion, in turn, contracted with former MI-6 Russia specialist Christopher Steele to look specifically at Trump and Russia. </p>\n<p>Steele’s investigation ended with a number of allegations, including that Trump is possibly being blackmailed by Russian security services with a recording of him paying prostitutes to pee on a bed at a luxury hotel at Moscow, and also that Trump’s campaign was the beneficiary of a multifaceted Kremlin plot to interfere in the 2016 US election. </p>\n<p>BuzzFeed published Steele’s dossier in January 2017, setting off a firestorm of controversy and intriguing many liberals. But in recent months, the dossier has taken on new life as the centerpiece of a conservative counter-conspiracy theory, which holds that the whole Trump-Russia investigation was cooked up by the president’s political enemies. Simpson’s testimony is significant in the present context primarily for debunking that narrative. </p>\n<h3>The dossier is now the centerpiece of a conservative counternarrative</h3>\n<p>On January 3, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) — a key House conservative — rolled out a tweetstorm asking 18 questions about the FBI and Russia, many of them centering on the dossier.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1) Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, author of the dossier?</p>— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/948567147155947520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Jordan, joined by another leading House conservative, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), is also <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/reps-mark-meadows-and-jim-jordan-its-time-for-jeff-sessions-to-go-as-shown-by-the-latest-fbi-leak/article/2644934\"><strong>calling for Trump to fire Jeff Sessions</strong></a> so he can put a new attorney general in place who would oversee (and presumably quash) the Russia investigation. This is part of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/5/16737350/mueller-russia-scandal-peter-strzok-trump\"><strong>broader conservative effort to discredit the Mueller investigation</strong></a>, which in turn is part of a broader <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/19/16503026/trump-tweets-russia-uranium-dossier\"><strong>conservative counternarrative on the whole Russia scandal</strong></a>. </p>\n<p>And the dossier plays a key role in this conspiracy theory. </p>\n<p>Because conservatives are “just asking questions” about the FBI and Steele, they tend not to explicitly state what they think happened. But in broad strokes, the theory is something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trump’s political enemies paid Fusion GPS to write a dossier full of debunked claims about his connections to Russia.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/22/14598834/trump-deep-state\"><strong>“Deep state”</strong></a> anti-Trump elements in the FBI used this false opposition research document to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant targeting <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/1/16724232/flynn-testify-against-trump\"><strong>Michael Flynn</strong></a>.</li>\n<li>The Flynn surveillance, which never should have been allowed because it was based on the phony dossier, was used to catch him in a lie about a meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that was completely innocuous. </li>\n<li>This got Flynn fired and, by making meetings with Kislyak into a hot-button issue, also forced Sessions into recusing himself, which in turn gave Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (whom Trump has decided is <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365406-trump-privately-calling-rosenstein-a-threat-to-his-presidency-report\"><strong>“a Democrat,”</strong></a> though it’s not clear why) the opportunity to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel. </li>\n<li>Mueller, in turn, is buddies with former FBI Director James Comey, who is bitter about having been fired by Trump (Comey under this theory is a bad guy because he went too easy on Hillary Clinton over the email server, and we’re not supposed to pay attention to the fact that Trump’s stated reason for firing him was that he was <em>too</em> <em>hard</em> on Clinton) and is therefore leading an anti-Trump witch hunt. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, of course, other penumbras and emanations around the conservative account of the Steele dossier. Former Rep. Jason Chaffetz was on Fox recently, for example, arguing that it’s <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/03/following-bombshell-report-fox-news-desperately-clinging-their-alternate-reality-about-russia/218961\"><strong>against the law to hire a foreign national</strong></a> to do work for a campaign (this is not true) and therefore the existence of the dossier is just another example of Crooked Hillary’s lawbreaking. </p>\n<p>The reality, however, is that while Steele is well-regarded in intelligence circles, there is no indication that his work has ever been the basis of the FBI’s Russia investigation.</p>\n<p>Papadopoulos was the start of the investigation</p>\n<p>A New York Times report earlier this month indicated that the investigation began not with Steele’s dossier but with Papadopoulos’s drunken conversation with Downer, Australia’s ambassador to the UK and a former Australian foreign minister. </p>\n<p>Simpson’s testimony appears to independently corroborate what the New York Times already reported — the FBI listened to Steele because they already had an investigation into this question underway, an investigation that was launched because Papadopoulos’s conversation with Downer was shared with other Australian officials, who ultimately passed word of it to their American counterparts once the hacking of Democratic email accounts became a big deal.</p>\n<p>As best as we can tell, this, rather than Steele’s memo, was the start of the investigation.</p>\n<p>And while the investigation has not yet proven the existence of anything like the vast conspiracy that Steele alleges, it certainly has uncovered real evidence of wrongdoing — including a guilty plea from Papadopoulos himself, and serious charges against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. </p>\n<p>We’ve also learned from the investigation that key Trumpworld figures, including Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr., were, at a minimum, eager to potentially collaborate with the Russian government on revealing anti-Clinton “dirt,” rather than emulating Downer in alerting the authorities to the existence of an active Russian intelligence effort aimed at the United States.</p>\n<p>It also, obviously, continues to be an ongoing investigation that might yet reveal other criminal activity. Or it might not. But either way, Simpson’s testimony — which Republicans on the committee didn’t want released to the public — is more evidence that the question was taken seriously by law enforcement for reasons that had nothing to do with Steele or his dossier.</p>\n<p></p>",

Islamophobia into the official guiding light of American immigration policy,” legitimizing and codifying the xenophobia and racism Trump had harnessed to win the presidency. And in many respects, Trump’s strategy has been effective. The ban — and the Trump presidency overall — has heralded a new wave of Islamophobic incidents in America. According to the Council on American Islamic Relations, 2017 was potentially <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017-in-review/2017/12/29/16821690/2017-religion-trump-evangelicals-roy-moore-witches\">one of the worst years in America for Muslims</a>, with anti-Islamic violence and hate speech exceeding the year immediately following the 9/11 attacks. </p>\n<p>But a<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11109-017-9439-z%3Fno-access%3Dtrue\" target=\"_blank\"> study</a> published this week in the journal <em>Political Behavior</em> suggests that Trump’s Muslim ban may have had an unexpected upside, according to political scientists Loren Collingwood, Nazita Lajevardi, and Kassra A.R. Oskooii of the<strong> </strong>University of California Riverside, Michigan State University, and the University of Delaware, respectively. </p>\n<p>The authors found that the national discourse about the Muslim ban — and a general sense from liberal and mainstream media that the policy was at odds with “American values” — prompted some respondents to shift their attitudes, ultimately causing many Americans who had previously supported or been neutral on the issue of Trump’s Muslim ban to come down against it. </p>\n<p>The team surveyed 423 people in early 2017, right before and then about a week after Trump signed the executive order. The study’s authors concluded that the media backlash to the ban and the national conversation it prompted caused many participants to reevaluate their views. More than 30<s> </s>percent of participants said they felt more negatively about the ban a week after its announcement than they did in the days leading up to it.</p>\n<p>This is striking in part because, according to the study’s authors, sudden significant shifts in public opinion tend to be rare. Second, those whose views shifted most radically were those who cited their identity as Americans as a major part of their self-conception overall. This suggests that public debate that centered on the Muslim ban being “un-American,” or otherwise counter to American values of openness and hospitality toward foreigners, had contributed to this shift. Write the study’s authors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the hours and days after the executive order was signed we also demonstrated that the information environment — which overwhelmingly focused on the ban above other news events and executive orders — painted the ban, to some degree, as inherently un-American. Challenges to the ban were numerous, with protesters, media commentators, and elites repeatedly and openly critiquing it as fundamentally incompatible with core American values.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, when challenged by what the paper’s authors describe as a media atmosphere focusing on what it “means” to be American, respondents generally found that “Americanness” meant inclusivity, not isolation.</p>\n<p>Trump’s appeals to patriotism and “American values” have done much to advance a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/22/14762030/donald-trump-tribal-epistemology\">jingoistic and xenophobic agenda</a>. But in this case, at least, the study’s authors suggest that “American values” can mean so much more.</p>",

Doug Jones (D-AL) means that Senate Republicans have a razor-thin majority of 51 votes. They need 60 votes to pass a long-term spending bill. Democrats have made clear<strong> </strong>that whatever fiscal bill they pass should include<strong> </strong>a legislative fix for the<strong> </strong>young, unauthorized immigrants known as DREAMers. Republicans want to pass a standalone immigration bill with increased border security. The Trump administration recently brought back the demand of a border wall, a Democratic no-go. </p>\n<p>On paper, Democrats have the leverage; Republicans need at least nine Democratic votes in the Senate to keep the government open. But Democrats’ path to getting what they want is politically risky, especially if they decide to force a government shutdown. Things are complicated by the fact that 2018 is a high-stakes election year that already has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/11/16748716/chart-democrats-2018-midterms-elections\">the makings of a blue wave</a> — something Democrats don’t want to screw up.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s clear that either party has leverage,” said Frances Lee, a political science professor at the University of Maryland who studies Congress. “It’s a politically ambiguous moment.” </p>\n<h3>Republicans could get a lot of blame for a shutdown</h3>\n<p>Republicans have typically shouldered the blame for past government shutdowns, but neither party has walked away unscathed. </p>\n<p>The fallout from the biggest government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 was complicated; both then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and President Bill Clinton were criticized after Clinton vetoed a Republican spending bill over disagreements on spending levels. </p>\n<p>The 2013 government shutdown was pinned squarely on conservative Republicans — particularly Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who held a long-term spending bill hostage in an attempt to defund Obamacare. Though their poll numbers plummeted in the immediate aftermath of the shutdown, Republicans went on to win in a wave election during the 2014 midterms when they retook the Senate and consolidated their largest House majority since 1928.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very tricky business to say we can pin a shutdown on one party and one party alone,” John Sides, associate professor of political science at George Washington University, said. </p>\n<p>Since Republicans currently hold the power in all branches of government, it’s unlikely they’d escape blame if a shutdown was triggered over immigration. That’s especially because President Trump’s administration began sunsetting the DACA program in September — punting a fix to Congress. Trump has also talked openly about the possibility of shutdown, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/331512-trump-us-needs-a-good-shutdown\">tweeting</a> last spring, “Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!”</p>\n<p>The president’s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\">approval rating</a> has been at a historic low since he entered office, and a government shutdown that he has publicly encouraged probably wouldn’t be a boost.</p>\n<p>“A shutdown is as much a risk for (Trump) as it is for other Republicans,” Sides said. “His actions, I think, could be interpreted as contributing to it.”</p>\n<h3>But then, so could Democrats </h3>\n<p>While Republicans — particularly hardline conservatives — have been known to pull dramatic political tactics, Democrats have long tried to portray themselves as the responsible governing party. </p>\n<p>“It would be dangerous for Democrats to use a filibuster to cause a government shutdown over DACA and immigration,” Lee said. “It looks like an extreme move to shut the government down over an issue that impacts a small minority living in the US.”</p>\n<p>Still, Democrats have plenty of reasons to fight for immigrants. There is <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2488\">widespread support</a> in the American public, including Republicans, for a long-term DACA fix. Many immigrants’ rights groups are closely aligned with the progressive grassroots movement.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>And immigrants have been waiting for a fix for nearly two decades. They’ve been asked to swallow a lot of compromises over the years, and Democrats failing to secure a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=daca+explained+vox&oq=daca+explained+vox&aqs=chrome..69i57.2731j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">permanent protections for undocumented youth</a> who have spent nearly their whole lives in the United States is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/21/16800808/house-senate-democrats-activists-spending-bill-daca\">unacceptable to many</a>. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, Democrats have been moving dramatically to the left on immigration issues in recent years, and Latino votes are key for them to capture in upcoming elections. As Vox’s Dara Lind <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/18/16458164/democrats-daca-border-security-schumer-pelosi\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Democrats have come to defer<em> </em>to organized immigration activists in a way they didn’t 10 years ago, or even during the early years of the Obama administration. Thanks in part to a change of strategy by major labor unions, whose success in organizing immigrant-heavy professions like the hospitality industry rather than relying on its traditional manufacturing base, this important component of the Democratic base has wholly embraced the idea of comprehensive immigration reform. As a result, the party has moved substantially to the left on the issue of immigration enforcement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Democratic leadership have to walk a fine line between listening to activists and barreling towards a shutdown. </p>\n<p>“The Democratic leadership has to balance these two things,” said University of Maryland political science professor David Karol. “In general, the party has to think about how much do we have to do for the groups in our coalition to keep them from bolting.” </p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers are already blaming Republicans for a possible shutdown, painting their colleagues as obstinate and unwilling to negotiate.</p>\n<p>“President Trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall. With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the minority whip, said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/949401306816569344\">statement on Friday</a>. “It’s outrageous that the White House would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish list of hardline anti-immigrant bills — plus an additional $18 billion in wall funding — on the backs of these young people.”</p>\n<p>It was the most explicit statement that Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and a key player in the immigration debate, has made so far on the possibility of a government shutdown. But he was careful to pin responsibility on the Republicans, who have been doing the exact same thing to Democrats. </p>\n<p>Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) complained on the Senate floor earlier this week that Democrats were aiming too high, and not bargaining in good faith. Grassley griped that Democrats wouldn’t negotiate for anything less than a clean DREAM Act, without the border security measures the GOP wants.</p>\n<p>“As the Democrats see it, it’s take it or leave it, their way or the highway,” Grassley said. “That isn’t good faith. That isn’t negotiation.”</p>\n<h3>The 2018 electoral stakes probably don’t matter that much — but that doesn’t stop Democrats from worrying about them</h3>\n<p>The 2018 midterms are on the horizon, and they’re sure to play into both Republican and Democratic calculations on whether or not to push a shutdown. But electorally, it probably doesn’t matter all that much, because we are still nine months out from November, Lee and Sides said.</p>\n<p>“It’s too far out from the election for this to matter,” Lee said. “This is just January; public memory is pretty short.”</p>\n<p>Case in point, the shutdowns in 1995-1996 and 2013 didn’t really hurt Republicans. Democrats picked up a few seats in the 1996 midterms, but Republicans retained their majority. In 2014, Republicans made huge gains, solidifying majorities in both the House and Senate and sweeping state legislatures and governors’ mansions. </p>\n<p>The tide appears to be turning in 2018. Democrats are currently leading <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2018_generic_congressional_vote-6185.html\">RealClearPolitics’ generic ballot</a> polling average by 11.4 points, and have been in a double-digit lead in recent months. For context, the last time their polling average was this good was before the 2006 midterms, when <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/21/16803050/latest-2018-midterms-polling-extremely-good-democrats\">Democrats flipped the House</a>. </p>\n<p>“Clearly, the energy leading into this year’s midterms (is with) the Democrats,” Sides said. “I think Republicans are much more scared than Democrats are.”</p>\n<p>Still, the generic ballot is not ironclad; lots could happen between now and November. And even if Republicans escaped relatively unharmed from their shutdowns, Democrats are sure to be worrying about how a shutdown could impact their 2018 chances.</p>\n<p>Activists and the left wing of the party want Democrats in Congress to hold firm and push for a deal on DACA. They’re not the only ones; the Center for American Progress Action Fund recently released a memo on behalf of its president, Jennifer Palmieri, formerly a key Obama White House and Clinton campaign staffer, echoing the same message. <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogressaction.org/content/uploads/2018/01/07111144/MemoOnDreamers.pdf\">In the memo</a>, Palmieri issued a call to congressional Democrats to stand strong for DREAMers, or face the consequences. </p>\n<p>“If Democrats can’t even stand up to Trump and Republicans in defense of Dreamers —whose moral case is unassailable — they will leave a lot of progressives wondering who Democrats will fight for,” Palmieri wrote. “At that point, Latinos may not be the only constituency within the Democratic base that becomes dispirited and disengaged. If Democrats don’t try to do everything in their power to defend Dreamers, that will jeopardize Democrats’ electoral chances in 2018 and beyond.”</p>",

What power does Trump’s Cabinet have to declare him incapable of performing his duties?</p>\n<p>The answer to both questions turns on an interpretation of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv\">25th Amendment </a>to the Constitution, which was ratified in the aftermath of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. The amendment sought to establish a process whereby the president could be removed or replaced in the event of death or some other incapacitation. </p>\n<p>It was primarily about ensuring continuity in government, but Section 4 of the amendment stipulates that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can declare the president unfit for office and then send a formal notice to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate. Once that happens, the vice president becomes the “Acting President.”</p>\n<p>Are we inching closer to that possibility right now? And if so, is there a legitimate case to make that the 25th Amendment ought to be invoked?</p>\n<p>To understand what the 25th Amendment is, how it was intended to be used, and if it can be plausibly invoked to remove Trump from office, I reached out to Jay Berman, a former chief of staff to Sen. Birch Bayh (D-IN) and one of the co-authors of the amendment. </p>\n<p>A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows. </p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>You helped write the 25th Amendment. Why was it created?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>It was created very specifically in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination, which was a real crisis point for our government and for the country. But it was also created at a moment that was perceived to be the beginning of the nuclear age, and so we recognized that we needed processes that fit the realities of the new world. Suddenly the stakes were higher, and the power of the presidency was enormous. We needed procedures and checks in place so that the government could still function in the event of an emergency or some other unanticipated crisis. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>But certainly one of the goals was to have the ability to remove an unstable or unfit president from office if it was deemed necessary for the sake of the country.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>That was definitely one of the purposes.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What does it actually say about the conditions under which a president can be removed from office?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Well, that’s the big question, isn’t it? It’s much more about process than it is about setting into the Constitution a trigger mechanism. The president has to be unfit to fulfill his obligations. Everything about the 25th Amendment implies that removing an elected president is primarily a political act. Of course, it should be informed by medical opinion on both the physical and mental health of the president, but ultimately the act of removing the president is a political act.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>So how does that process get started? Who initiates the use of the 25th Amendment?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>The mechanism for triggering it is the vice president taking the first step and getting a majority of the Cabinet to assert that the president is incapable of fulfilling his duties. If that happens, they then send a formal written notice to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate. </p>\n<p>If the president doesn’t dispute this, the vice president becomes the “Acting President.” But if the president disputes this declaration, then two-thirds of the Senate must agree that he’s unfit for office in order for him to be removed. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>It’s relatively easy to determine that a president is physically incapable of performing his duties, but how do we decide that a president is mentally unfit?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Everything begins with the vice president. The vice president has to determine in his own mind that the president can’t meet his constitutional responsibilities because of a variety of mental reasons. If the 25th Amendment had included a set of circumstances in which the trigger mechanism said, “You know, he’s wacko, he tweets insane things, he says insane things, we have to remove him,” it never would have passed.</p>\n<p>So we determined that it would be a political decision left to the vice president, the Cabinet, and Congress. That’s how we designed it, for better or worse.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Does it allow for Congress to act in the event that the vice president is negligent or unwilling?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>The 25th Amendment didn’t provide the specific trigger you’re asking about it, but it does authorize Congress, under Section 4, to create a body that could examine the president’s fitness for office. But in a partisan environment like this, it’s hard to believe that this could ever happen. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“I think he was elected to do these dumb things. He hasn’t become dumber or meaner since he was elected — this is who he’s always been.”</q></aside></div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>I’ll ask you straightforwardly: Do you think the 25th Amendment should be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>No.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Why not?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>At this moment, I don’t think he meets the test of a president who’s incapable of fulfilling his responsibilities. I think he was elected to do these dumb things. He hasn’t become dumber or meaner since he was elected — this is who he’s always been. This was who he was when he ran, and may well have been the reason people elected him. </p>\n<p>The problem is that we have a ridiculous electoral system and a bizarre set of circumstances that conspired to make this situation possible. But I can’t honestly say that the 25th Amendment is the answer right now. The answer right now is impeachment. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Well, that leaves us in almost an absurd position. The country made a grievous mistake, we all know it, and yet we’re forced to watch this tragicomedy unfold knowing how disastrously bad it could get.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Correct.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>You’re not cheering me up, Jay.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>I think we ought to be talking more about how horrible our electoral system is, a system that commits the person with less votes to beat the candidate with more votes. This is the fundamental issue which people have neglected to think about in the rush to the 25th Amendment. None of this would have happened if we had a direct popular election, but we don’t do it that way, and now we’re trying to fit the 25th Amendment into this unique set of circumstances.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>I understand all that, but we are where we are and I’m trying to think through the options we have. The 25th Amendment, whatever its original intent, still allows for a determination to be made about a president’s mental fitness. If someone like Trump, who each day appears more unhinged, more unstable, more deluded, cannot be declared mentally unfit, is it conceivable that anyone could?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>It’s very alarming, what we’re witnessing right now. But the bar for the 25th Amendment is set extraordinarily high. I agree that the president appears unhinged, but he’s always appeared unhinged, and he was still elected in a legitimate political act. If, for example, he decided he wanted to go to war with North Korea against the advice of literally everyone else, then we would be in different territory in terms of the 25th Amendment. But right now I just don’t see it. I see more than enough grounds for impeachment, however. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“I sleep worse every night knowing Donald Trump is president”</q></aside></div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Perhaps, but for the partisan reasons you mentioned above, impeachment is equally unlikely to happen, unless the Democrats retake Congress.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>I never suggested we were in a good place. We’re in a very bad place. I sleep worse every night knowing Donald Trump is president, but I don’t think we can find some shortcut for dealing with that. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Should we be talking about the 25th Amendment at all?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Absolutely. I think there should be changes to the 25th Amendment to make it more viable and applicable to today’s world. I’m not saying that in terms of Donald Trump, but I’m saying to the world we live in. I think we need to empower Congress further to act in a responsible and timely way, but again, there is a mechanism in the 25th Amendment already that permits Congress to do something. But I’ll repeat what I said earlier: Would you trust this Congress to do its job?</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>At this point, I wouldn’t trust Congress to make a cup of coffee.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>If you sat down to rewrite the 25th Amendment today, what would you change? What would you add?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>I would amend it to actually require that in the process of determining if the president is fit for office, that there be some professional medical input on an ongoing basis, not some commentary on what the guy did yesterday, because every day he does something crazy. That’s one way to make it more relevant to a circumstance like the one we’re now in. </p>\n<p>I certainly prefer that to what we have now, which is knowing this guy is crazy but unable to prove it. </p>",

He is the founder and editor-at-large of the conservative magazine <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/\">the Weekly Standard</a>. </p>\n<p>In the 1990s, he helped <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/6/10/8759221/bill-kristol-1993-health-memo-obamacare\">kill Bill Clinton’s health care plan</a>, ushering in what one Slate commentator called the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/dying_breed.html\">death of the “reasonable Republican.”</a> He helped <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/bill-kristol-doesnt-want-any-more-credit-sarah-palins-career/311984/\">launch Sarah Palin’s national political career</a>. He served as a foreign policy adviser for John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign. </p>\n<p>And he fervently supported the Iraq War, saying in 2003 that US forces <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2015/05/21/iraq-war-architect-bill-kristol-knowing-what-we/203725\">“will be welcomed in Baghdad as liberators”</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/17/AR2007071701456.html\">that</a> “very few wars in American history were prepared better or more thoroughly than this one by this president.” </p>\n<p>Then came Donald Trump, who, after <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/2016-bill-kristol-republicans-conservative-movement-donald-trump-politics-214025\">failing</a> to get Kristol’s support, called him “a dummy” and “a loser.” (Breitbart called him a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/05/16/breitbart_calls_bill_kristol_a_renegade_jew_is_disgusting.html\">“renegade Jew.”</a>) Kristol quickly emerged as the never-est of the Never Trumpers — Republicans and conservatives who could not and would not support Trump’s nomination for the presidency. </p>\n<p>In March 2016, Kristol told <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/kristol-explains-never-trump-argument/article/2001654\">CNN’s Jake Tapper</a>, “People really need to stop and think, do you want Donald Trump to be the national spokesperson through an entire presidential election for the Republican party and the conservative movement? Is that acceptable?” </p>\n<p>That’s led to a surprising bedfellows coalition with some liberals, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/kristol-is-clear/485180/\">who supported his efforts</a> to find a third-party candidate to challenge Trump and have followed him on Twitter by the thousands.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The GOP tax bill's bringing out my inner socialist.

But we started our conversation by discussing the relationship between the conservative movement and conservative voters. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<h4>Bill Kristol</h4>\n<p>Every political movement, and certainly [every] intellectual movement, is obviously a bit orthogonal to the actual interest of voters. I think conservatism has been pretty successful, actually, at navigating between being a sort of excessively abstract movement that would be out of touch entirely of voters and simply capitulating to or mirroring voters’ instincts, prejudices, and so forth. </p>\n<p>I mean, it’s not like Pat Buchanan hasn’t existed. It’s not like Ron Paul hasn’t existed. It’s not like there aren’t a lot of things that people like me found, not just distasteful, but really important to defeat within the conservative ambit. I kind of assumed Trumpism was just the latest iteration of that, [like Ross] Perot, if you want to be nicer. </p>\n<h4>Jane Coaston</h4>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Bill Kristol</strong> </h4>\n<p>Who wasn’t, you know, I think bigoted the way Buchanan and Paul are, but still, it was a mixture of sensible unhappiness with certain things and then some various crackpot theories. And so that was the surprise. I think conservatives had gotten too complacent, just too confident, in a way, that these things could be managed. So I wasn’t surprised that the voters weren’t where I was on a lot of things. </p>\n<p>I was surprised that Trump was able to be a very successful demagogue and foster anxieties and resentments in ways that couldn’t be overcome by the, quote, “normal” Republican candidates in 2015-2016. I was then surprised that he won the election, as I guess everyone was. I’m not entirely shocked, because I always said during the campaign that he had a one-in-four chance of winning, just because when you’re in a wrong-track environment, the candidate of the status quo always has a risk of losing.</p>\n<p>But it is true that once he becomes president, it’s a whole different story. Presidents have real effects on the country, on their own party, on the movement which they’re vaguely associated with. And in that respect, I think it’s very much up in the air for me, you know, how fundamental the effect of Trump is. </p>\n<p>Could it be ultimately a kind of unfortunate parenthesis in the history of the Republican Party and of conservatism, modern American conservatism? Or is it an inflection point where the party has to fundamentally rethink itself, or you need to have a new party, or conservatism has to be almost fundamentally redefined, or you have to say, “that was a good 60-year run for American conservatism, but time for something else”?</p>\n<p>That, I think, is really, for me, an open question, and more of an open question at the end of this year [2017] than it was at the beginning. I think if we had had this conversation 10 months ago, I would have said, “You know, I think we can get beyond Trump.”</p>\n<p>But now the degree of rationalization by Republicans, among Republicans, the degree of excuse-making for Trump, the degree to which Trump has changed, apparently, Republican voters’ views. </p>\n<p>That, I think, could be temporary, and yeah, they’re susceptible to that. Voters tend to follow the president of their own party that they voted for. But the degree to which he’s sort of changed conservative thinkers’ views, or seems to have, that’s unnerving and worrisome, and makes me think maybe we are in a more fundamental inflection point. </p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>Why do you think voters did not agree with you? If conservatism is working, why do voters not see it?</p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>Well, it’s not.</p>\n<p>It’s not working as well maybe as it could. It certainly got a little out of touch. I mean, I wouldn’t overdo it. I mean, I think progressives like you would be the first to admit that, much to your displeasure, conservatism has been electorally quite successful. And last I looked, there is a Republican Congress and there are Republican governors, and a fair number of conservative policies are being pursued — some of them intelligent, some of them not so sound. Certainly, the dissatisfaction with elites of both parties is very great. </p>\n<p>There were aftereffects of 2008, obviously, and of Iraq and other things, but the degree of unhappiness with elites of both parties and of both ideologies, if you will, is greater than certainly than I would have expected. </p>\n<p>Some of that is real, based on stagnant incomes and other things. Some of it is ... people get themselves whipped up and overly unhappy with the way things, are and if politicians can tap into that, people can be very unhappy, even if the objective facts might suggest they shouldn’t be quite that unhappy. At some point, you do have to educate voters and make your case to voters, not just capitulate to them. </p>\n<p>The capitulation across the board on the right has been very striking to me. This was a movement that was full of people who had kind of proud memories of themselves or others standing up to the voters at times. And the whole point of conservatism, in a way, is not to believe that the people are always right. </p>\n<p>It’s not to believe that history goes in one direction. It’s not to believe the arc of history tells you what you should do. It’s to be a little bit resistant to all that. And because Trump wins one election with 46-point-something percent of the vote, we’re all supposed to just decide that everything we’ve studied for years, all the history we’ve read for years, all the people we’ve admired for years, that was all wrong. </p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>There was a lot of talk before Inauguration Day that under Trump, we’re going to be <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/27/presidential-debate-nafta-agreement/\">setting fire to NAFTA</a> and that there’s going to be widespread change of a more populist, kind of a Steve Bannon-esque line. But this year, Trump has run, in many ways, a largely standard Republican platform. When Trump is making decisions that you agree with, but it’s still Trump doing it, is that challenging for you, and how do you examine that? </p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s somewhat challenging, because of course who makes the decision and how he justifies it does matter as well. So the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454779/david-frum-proves-my-point\">balls and strikes</a> thing is just simple-minded and silly, ultimately. I mean, you’ve got one team, if you want to use this analogy and belabor it, that isn’t committed to playing the game according to the traditional rules. </p>\n<p>At that point, you can’t just sit there and say, “I’m just calling balls and strikes and I don’t care if the pitcher is, you know, stepping 20 feet off the mound and throwing spitballs and trying to bean the other team’s batters.” At some point, you have to say, “We have to defend the rules of the game.”</p>\n<p>So it does get complicated. I’m not on the “balls and strikes” side. I’m not on the “fanatically opposed to everything that the Trump administration does because it’s done by the Trump administration side,” either. So I support the moving of the [US] embassy to Jerusalem, or the revision of Title IX, or traditional positions the Weekly Standard has argued for before Trump even existed. </p>\n<p>But I think it would also be foolish to go the other direction and say you don’t rethink anything. The fact of Trump is a big fact. You’d be foolish not to rethink your judgment of some aspects of conservatism, insofar as it’s enabled Trump, insofar as so many conservatives are enabling Trump. It has made me rethink certain aspects of conservative doctrine and dogma. </p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>Like what? </p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s something like voter ID [laws]. Obviously you have to have some way of making sure people don’t vote many times. On the other hand, there are legitimate arguments about how to do that. But someone like me would have said a year or two ago, “Come on. Is having a driver’s license such a big deal?” But I’m a little more sympathetic, I’d say, to the arguments of the left on some of those issues, that there are racial undertones to some of these policies, especially in certain parts of the country. </p>\n<p>On other issues, one has to also just say, look, if certain policies are right, or if the world is going to be safer if we do this, the fact that the public is, quote, “war-weary” or the public has certain instincts about how they don’t want to do X, Y or Z, those instincts have be challenged. I mean, just like in the ’30s, the public had all kind of instincts, and a lot of them were very damaging over the next 10 years. </p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>I’ve talked to [conservative commentator] <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/8/16742978/inside-bubble-roy-moore-conservative-media\">Ben Shapiro</a>, for example, about conservative media, and something that Shapiro brought up is that there used to be gatekeepers. One of the first things that [William F. Buckley, founder of National Review] did was <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448774/william-f-buckley-john-birch-society-history-conflict-robert-welch\">essentially kick out the John Birch Society</a> and say, “Okay, we can’t have rampant anti-Semitism. We just can’t do it.” I can even think of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/04/national-review-fires-john-derbyshire-119887\">National Review basically saying</a>, “Okay, John Derbyshire, you’ve got to go.”</p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>But what Shapiro says is that over the last five, six, seven years, is that there’s no need for those gatekeepers, so you’re getting kind of the more Breitbart-y, far-right conservatism. What do you think about that? </p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>I think a lot of that is just technology and social media, obviously. I’m not one to think that, you know, oh, in the good old days, there were these gatekeepers. I mean, a) they didn’t keep the gates very well. I mean, people are a little too nostalgic about the good old days, and there were a lot of other people who weren’t expelled and a lot of people who did very well in the era of radio in the ’50s. Joe McCarthy existed before social media. </p>\n<p>I think people are too nostalgic, on the one hand, and maybe too despairing about the current situation. It’s a free country, you know. </p>\n<p>Breitbart is entitled to have their website, and they’re entitled to make their case. Maybe we haven’t done a very good job of making the alternate case. Maybe sometimes the mood just sweeps you along and you have a bad few years. </p>\n<p>Again, none of this would be that noticeable, honestly, if Trump hadn’t won. And, look, I don’t mean to minimize that he won, so it’s a big deal. [But] it wasn’t inevitable that he was going to win. He won in a somewhat flukey election. </p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>Because of your opposition to Trump, you’ve now got a bunch of liberals who are now saying, “Ah, yes. I have this strange new respect for you,” perhaps changing their views of you in the process. What do you think of that? </p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>Well, they should rethink. That’d be good. If they rethought their mindless progressivism and realize that limited government is a good thing. Having a president who doesn’t control the rest of the country, a government that doesn’t control the rest of the country, is a good thing. Federalism is a good thing. </p>\n<p>In a lot of states, the locality is morally right, the private sector is a good thing. You don’t want government, the president, personally choosing what companies flourish and which don’t, so you want some markets, sort of impersonal markets to work. </p>\n<p>You don’t want America First foreign policy, and that does mean if the alternative is just America withdrawal, there also shouldn’t be America withdrawal, but kind of American-global leadership, so that gets you back in the business of everything from nation building to international alliances.</p>\n<p>I mean, Trump in a way is the ultimate victory of a certain kind of identity politics. He saw it as, “Well, gee, if everyone else gets to have identity politics, let’s just have white working-class identity politics.” </p>\n<p>And guess what? The white working class is big, and the white working-class identity politics turned out to be pretty nasty, and since they’re bigger than the various minority groups that were engaged in identity politics, it turns out they win an election and can follow up some of these things in a very nasty way. </p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Jane Coaston</strong> </h4>\n<p>It’s interesting that you said that, because there is a reflexive anti-liberalism that is a part of, I think, some of modern conservatism.</p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>Sure.</p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>Where the point is not, “This is a good policy.” The point is, “This is going to make liberals really upset.”</p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>Yeah. </p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>And you hear from Trump supporters that, “Well, conservatives just <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2017/09/25/conservative-inc-is-being-replaced-by-us-militant-normals-n2385943\">never fought</a>.” What do you think about that?</p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>They should go back and read histories of Reagan’s uphill struggles and others’ later on, and fights over the Iraq War, which you mentioned. It did not end up being a popular position to support the surge in 2006 and defend it in 2007, so I think we’ve fought plenty. Look, any movement will have a certain reflexive, “If they like it, we shouldn’t like it.” You and I do this. I’m sure everyone does this. </p>\n<p>As a serious guide to policy or to politics it’s, of course, idiotic, and it’s depressing how many conservatives don’t see that. This is honestly the essence of their understanding of politics, as hating the things that the people they hate like. </p>\n<p>Why do they even hate the people in the first place, though? I mean, that’s sort of — it’s sort of circular, right? I guess because I don’t know why, because they’ve been fighting them for 10 years or they have temperamental dislike for them or something like that. </p>\n<p>It is right-wing identity politics. The left in America today is multicultural, multiethnic, younger, diverse, different from some of these Trump supporters’ view of America, and they look at that and they just recoil; then they decide they love Trump because he’s making [the left] very angry. That’s childish. And we all probably indulge that a little too much on the right. </p>\n<p>I guess I’ll make this point. You mentioned earlier about people being so unhappy. There’s something a little crazy about our discourse now, I think. I mean, America in 2016, 2017 is not the worst country in the history of the world to live in. </p>\n<p>The liberal world order, with America at its core over the last 70 years, has not produced the worst 70 years in history of the world, let alone in the history of the last 100 years. </p>\n<p>We kind of know what the first half of the 20th century was like. It’s not so that there hasn’t been progress in a huge number of social spheres. Here, I will argue against conservatives and give liberals some credit for that.</p>\n<p>People are just too unhappy with the status quo, in my opinion. If you came down and looked at America and at the world, you’d say there’s a fair amount to be happy and be grateful for. </p>\n<p>And that’s always what conservatives were pretty good at, actually, was making the point to progressives that, “Hey, slow down here. There’s a lot to be grateful for, and you shouldn’t take it for granted before you race off to change this or that.” That’s a kind of sensible conservative instinct. And it would be nice to have a bit of a return of that.</p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Coaston</strong></h4>\n<p>Do you think that conservatism or the conservative movement bears any responsibility for Donald Trump?</p>\n<h4><strong>Bill Kristol</strong></h4>\n<p>Yeah. Just practically speaking, I mean, most conservatives opposed Trump in the primaries, and that’s good. But there was a fair amount of accommodation to Trump even early and then, of course, some massive accommodation to Trump once he clinched the nomination. </p>\n<p>So just in a very practical sense, conservatives and the conservative movement bear some responsibility for the fact that he’s president. ... And since he’s been president, there has obviously been a lot of rationalizing of him, so again, just in a very kind of concrete way, the answer has to be yes. In a deeper way, in terms of the last five, 10, 20, 30, 40 years, I would say yes. </p>\n<p>There was a kind of, in retrospect, excessive tolerance of things that should have been denounced more firmly. I mean, I thought we denounced them. I will say, you know, the Weekly Standard was pretty unapologetically anti-birther and anti-Buchanan and anti-Ron Paul, and anti- so many things that Trump exploited. Pretty liberal on immigration, but maybe in retrospect we didn’t take those things serious enough. </p>\n<p>When we started denouncing Trump, it seemed to help him in a way. There was always that argument of, “Well, if you establishment types denounce him, that’s just going to make him look stronger.” I never bought that. I think that’s a big excuse people use. I mean, it’s idiotic. You have to make your case as much as you can even if people will try to turn it against you.</p>\n<p>I am personally surprised by the amount of rationalizing and enabling of Trump. I think I underestimated the power of rationalization as a human psychological fact. They start with a very hardheaded look, [saying] he’s not good and the tweeting is horror, he’s a jerk, and the tweeting is distasteful, but you know, we’ll get this and this. He’ll be better than Hillary and we can live with it, but we’ll have to control him.</p>\n<p>And then a month later it’s, “The media is being very unfair in their attacks. He’s getting more done than you realize.” And a month later it’s, “Some of the stuff you think is vulgar is probably necessary to really break though.” And then a month later it’s, “I kinda think he’s saying some things that other people haven’t said.” </p>\n<p>Within six months, people I know personally, they started off with a very hardheaded, limited defense of Trump. And they’re now all in and saying that Robert Mueller is some partisan hack who wants to destroy Trump and no other Republican has ever fought for anything. It’s just kind of idiotic Trumpy talking points. That slippery slope is more slippery than I realized. </p>",

She was speaking about her daughter, activist Erica Garner, who died<strong> </strong>December 30 after a heart attack. Garner went<strong> </strong>into cardiac arrest following an asthma attack a week earlier, and was later <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/28/16827004/erica-garner-critical-condition-heart-attack\">placed in a medically induced coma.</a> She reportedly<strong> </strong>suffered extensive brain damage due to a lack of oxygen. </p>\n<p>“She lived on her own terms,” Snipes-Garner said at her daughter’s Harlem, New York, funeral Monday evening. “And she died on her own terms.”</p>\n<p>For those who knew Garner well or followed her activist<strong> </strong>work, her death has been difficult to process. That she died at 27 is a tragedy. That she became an activist to seek justice in the wake of her father <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7327745/eric-garner-grand-jury-decision\">Eric Garner’s death</a> from an NYPD officer’s fatal chokehold is painful.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>During her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/nyregion/erica-garner-funeral-black-lives-matter.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&smtyp=cur&mtrref=t.co\">funeral</a>, those who gathered in her memory said that Garner was one of many who gave their lives to the fight for racial justice, a person whose life and death stand as a reminder of both the resilience of those who lose loved ones to police violence and the long-term effects that trauma often has on black women. </p>\n<p>“When her father died, she was the one going out there in Staten Island every Tuesday and Thursday,” Rev. Kevin McCall <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/erica-garner-hailed-harlem-funeral-fierce-advocate-article-1.3745760\">said</a>. “She was the one to bring this to a national level.”</p>\n<p>But as a young mother who gave birth in August to her second child, a boy named after her late father, <a href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2018/01/03/sickened-by-oppression-mourning-erica-garner/\">Garner is among an alarming number</a> of women in the US who die during pregnancy or within one year of childbirth. </p>\n<p>The ongoing maternal mortality crisis disproportionately affects black women, who the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm\">three to four times more likely</a> than white women to die from complications related to pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Why is this happening? The medical field is seeking answers, but one of the most obvious solutions is ensuring black women’s access to quality, unbiased medical care. </p>\n<p>“The combination of institutionalized racism, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901405/\">chronic stress, and the physical stress of childbirth can</a> be deadly, and some believe that this was the case for Garner, as it is for so many Black women in the United States,” Katie Mitchell wrote for<s> </s><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/after-erica-garners-death-we-need-to-talk-about-how-maternal-mortality-affects-black-women-7739678\">Bustle</a>. “And as we mourn [Garner’s] loss, we need to have a conversation about why <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/race-maternal-mortality-are-linked-black-mothers-are-paying-the-price-3017625\">maternal mortality disproportionately affects Black women</a> in the US, and what can be done about it.” </p>\n<h3>The US has failed to deal with its high rates of maternal mortality on many fronts — particularly for women of color</h3>\n<p>The US has very high maternal mortality rates compared to the rest of the developed world. As Vox’s Julia Belluz has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/6/29/15830970/women-health-care-maternal-mortality-rate\">reported</a>, maternal deaths have been on the rise in the US, increasing by 27 percent, to 24 deaths per 100,000 births, between <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001799/\">2000 and 2014</a>. Belluz notes that this rate is more than three times the maternal death rate of the United Kingdom, and about eight times the rate of Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. </p>\n<p>In recent years, a growing number of maternal health-focused organizations and academics have dedicated more time and resources to better understand the crisis. </p>\n<p>But there is still plenty that we don’t understand, particularly when it comes to the growing gap between the deaths of black mothers and their white peers. </p>\n<p>Research has shown that a number of factors, including poor access to pre- and postnatal care, chronic stress, and the effects of racism, and inadequate medical treatment in the years preceding childbirth are all likely to play a role in a black woman’s likelihood to suffer life-threatening complications in the months that come before and after childbirth. </p>\n<p>These issues might appear to suggest that the disparity between black women and white women dying from pregnancy-related causes is due to economic differences, but research has found that black women in higher economic brackets are still more likely than white women to die from pregnancy- and childbirth-related problems. </p>\n<p>A recent story from ProPublica’s Annie Waldman illustrates why black women in cities like New York cannot simply educate or earn their way out of the crisis: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even when accounting for risk factors like low educational attainment, obesity and neighborhood poverty level, the city’s black mothers still face significantly higher rates of <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf\">harm</a>, the agency found. Of note, black mothers who are college-educated fare worse than women of all other races who never finished high school. Obese women of all races do better than black women who are of normal weight. And black women in the wealthiest neighborhoods do worse than white, Hispanic and Asian mothers in the poorest ones.</p>\n<p>The health department has even mapped where the most maternal harm occurs, dividing the city into community districts. The highest rates of complications are concentrated in a swath of land in Central Brooklyn, in an area largely untouched by the wave of gentrification that has swept other parts of the borough. Here, mothers face up to four times the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf\">complication</a> rates of neighborhoods just a few subway stops away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In all, black women are 243 percent more likely than white women to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes, producing one of the largest racial disparities in women’s health, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth\">according to ProPublica</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem is further exacerbated by the American health care system’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/12/7/16746790/health-care-black-history-inequality\">history of disparate treatment of black women</a>, whose health struggles have been systemically minimized or dismissed, funneling them into medical facilities that are <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-hospitals-are-failing-black-mothers\">less equipped</a> to handle their pregnancies. </p>\n<p>As journalists Nina Martin and Renee Montagne<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth\"> explained</a> in a story on black maternal mortality in December, black women still report facing bias when receiving pregnancy-related care: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The feeling of being devalued and disrespected by medical providers was a constant theme. The young Florida mother-to-be whose breathing problems were blamed on obesity when in fact her lungs were filling with fluid and her heart was failing. The Arizona mother whose anesthesiologist assumed she smoked marijuana because of the way she did her hair. The Chicago-area businesswoman with a high-risk pregnancy who was so upset at her doctor’s attitude that she changed OB-GYNs in her seventh month, only to suffer a fatal postpartum stroke.</p>\n<p>Over and over, black women told of medical providers who equated being African American with being poor, uneducated, noncompliant and unworthy. “Sometimes you just know in your bones when someone feels contempt for you based on your race,” said one Brooklyn woman who took to bringing her white husband or in-laws to every prenatal visit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But if some of the problems have been identified, there are others that remain opaque. Much of our understanding of maternal deaths focuses on women who die from complications in the period preceding and immediately following childbirth, leaving those who die in the weeks and months after delivery, like Garner, less known. </p>\n<p>Because of the structure of the US maternal care system, which ProPublica has noted is <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system\">largely focused</a> on the health of infants and less on their mothers, women predisposed to the conditions that make a pregnancy high-risk can fall through the cracks.</p>\n<p>While limited and often inadequate health care access is certainly an issue, there have been disagreements about exactly how cuts to women’s health programs have affected the crisis in states like Texas, which has the highest rates of maternal mortality in the US. </p>\n<p>It’s not really an urban versus rural issue either. ProPublica notes that in New York City, Erica Garner’s hometown, “black mothers are 12 times <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ms/pregnancy-associated-mortality-report.pdf\">more likely</a> to die than white mothers.” </p>\n<p>Only one thing is certain: The crisis affects black women more than any other group. </p>\n<p>“This is a national tragedy, [but] we aren’t doing the research that’s needed and could hold hospitals accountable nationwide,” Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a senior fellow studying maternal mortality with MomsRising and a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, told Vox. </p>\n<p>While Garner’s death wasn’t officially deemed a result of her pregnancy, we know that her pregnancy exacerbated already present health issues.<strong> </strong>Snipes-Garner <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/nyregion/eric-garners-27-year-old-daughter-is-in-a-coma.html?mtrref=www.google.com\">told the New York Times</a> in December that her daughter’s first heart attack occurred shortly after giving birth to her second child in August. Doctors said the pregnancy strained Garner’s enlarged heart, a condition she was previously unaware of.</p>\n<p>“What we’re seeing with Erica Garner is not just complications because of birth, but a larger conversation around her lack of access to health care,” Khan-Cullors said. “Black women don’t receive the health care we deserve from the moment we are born. And our mothers didn’t receive the health care they deserve. By the time that we get pregnant and go to have children, the [absence of] care that we should have received [has had an effect] and our bodies are aged beyond our years.”</p>\n<h3>When health disparities go beyond medical issues </h3>\n<p>According to researchers, obesity, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/topic/health/diseases-illnesses/diabetes-HEDAI0000022-topic.html\">diabetes</a>, cesarean births, and delayed prenatal care are some of the risk factors that increase a woman’s chances of dying from pregnancy-related complications. Black women are particularly likely to deal with many of these issues. </p>\n<p>That’s not to mention other problems that black women are statistically more likely to face in their daily lives, like <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resources/women-and-poverty-state-state/\">poverty</a>, limited or infrequent access to health care, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-criminalization-of-black-girls-in-schools/473718/\">harsher discipline in schools</a>, and <a href=\"https://thelily.com/the-pay-gap-is-worse-for-black-women-heres-a-look-at-the-statistics-2c0adc0d3267\">lower pay</a> — all of which can contribute to high stress among black women. </p>\n<p>Such stress can make a pregnancy deadly for expectant and new black mothers and their children. Black infants are more than twice as likely as white infants to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/20/570777510/how-racism-may-cause-black-mothers-to-suffer-the-death-of-their-infants\">die within the first year of life</a>.</p>\n<p>“It’s chronic stress that just happens all the time — there is never a period where there’s rest from it, it’s everywhere, it’s in the air, it’s just affecting everything,” Fleda Mask Jackson, an Atlanta researcher and member of the <a href=\"http://blackmamasmatter.org/\">Black Mamas Matter Alliance</a>, told ProPublica last year. </p>\n<p>If chronic stress, largely driven by the daily effects of racism and discrimination, plays<strong> </strong>a role in killing black mothers, then particularly stressful incidents, like those brought on by the trauma of police violence, could be particularly aggravating. </p>\n<p>Christen Smith, an associate professor of African and African diaspora studies and anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin, argues that the aftermath of police violence is particularly harmful to black women, who are forced to deal with lingering trauma that may very well be killing them slowly. </p>\n<p>“When we think of police lethality, we typically consider the immediate body count: The people that die from bullets and baton blows. The <a href=\"https://policeviolencereport.org/\">death toll</a> gives the impression that black men are the disproportionate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">victims of police killings</a>. But these numbers do not reveal the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/slow-death-is-the-trauma-of-police-violence-killing-black-women-62264\">slow death</a> that black women experience,” Smith wrote in a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-fallout-of-police-violence-is-killing-black-women-like-erica-garner-89654\">recent op-ed</a> about Garner’s death<strong> </strong>and the long-term effects of police violence on black women. </p>\n<p>Garner’s case, Smith says, fits this pattern. In the years since Eric Garner’s death, Erica Garner became a prominent activist and outspoken critic of misconduct in policing. </p>\n<p>A few months after her father’s death, she staged a “die-in” on the same corner where he had been placed in a chokehold by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo.

Maybe.</p> <p>The big question for many casual observers of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/14/16764472/disney-fox-deal-merger\">Disney’s December 2017<strong> </strong>purchase of almost all of 21st Century Fox’s assets</a> has been, “Why?” The answer, a bit disappointingly, lies somewhere between “Disney wants as much streaming content as it can possibly get, and Fox’s film and TV libraries are chock full of <em>stuff” </em>and “because Disney could.”</p>\n<p>But it’s also worth looking at the individual Fox assets that Disney will end up owning, should the deal be finalized. (Regulators will have 12 to 18 months to approve or scuttle the deal.) While there are obvious areas where Fox and Disney overlap (like producing films <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/14/16738852/disney-fox-marvel-acquisition-x-men-superhero\">featuring superheroes who originated in Marvel comics</a>), there are also certain things Fox has that Disney doesn’t.</p>\n<p>In particular, Disney has never been great at playing to either the prestige film or prestige TV market. No movie released under the Disney banner has won Best Picture at the Oscars (though former subsidiary Miramax won a few times). The company’s fleet of networks (headed up by ABC) have had some success at the Emmys in the comedy categories but lag far behind networks like HBO, Netflix, or FX at recent trophy ceremonies.</p>\n<p>Certainly winning awards isn’t everything. But in the TV world, especially, having Emmys and critical acclaim often helps a show go from an obscurity to a staple of streaming services. (See: <em>Mad Men</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em>.) </p>\n<p>Did you notice how I mentioned FX above? Well, guess what cable network Disney just purchased.</p>\n<h3>In a best-case scenario, Disney turns FX into its own HBO. In a worst-case scenario, it strips the network for parts.</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The Night King’s dragon spits blue fire at the Wall on Game of Thrones.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5k7wJJpSMKkudrlMH7PC4hx6_k8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9129629/Courtesy_of_HBO__Photo_6_.jpg\">\n<cite>HBO</cite>\n<figcaption>Who wouldn’t love a <em>Game of Thrones</em> of their very own?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Disney is unusual in that it doesn’t really have an obvious prestige TV player within its massive corporate monolith. Showtime is part of the CBS family. HBO nestles within Time Warner. Netflix makes creating prestige dramas part of its business model. </p>\n<p>But Disney, for all its success in certain areas of show business (animated films and big franchise movies; family sitcoms and fast-paced melodramas on TV), lacks an obvious partner to make the sort of big, splashy drama series — think <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/westworld\"><em>Westworld</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/stranger-things\"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> — that suck up media attention, cultural oxygen, and viewers. </p>\n<p>You can make an argument (and, believe me, HBO has) that <em>Game of Thrones</em> is the most-watched show <em>in the world</em>, and it’s the big hit everybody is chasing right now. Why wouldn’t Disney? Thus, it would make sense for Disney to see FX as its best shot at HBO-style prestige drama.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of structural reasons FX might struggle to become as massive a brand as HBO, particularly on a global scale. The network’s workforce (which chief executive John Landgraf pegged in a recent press conference at 270 people) pales in comparison to HBO’s (which has over 2,000 workers). And it doesn’t offer the sort of standalone streaming experience HBO or Netflix does: FX+, while ad-free, is available only with a cable subscription.</p>\n<p>That “cable subscription” component reveals perhaps the biggest reason FX has never set its sights on worldwide domination like HBO and Netflix have. While FX can certainly spend plenty of money on a series if it needs to — Landgraf told me in an interview that the network’s per-episode budgets for drama series range from $4 million to $7 million — it’s never found itself with a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-level hit to support.</p>\n<p>The massive HBO show’s final season will command a reported budget of $15 million per episode (which is almost certainly lower than what HBO will actually end up paying). As evidenced by<strong> </strong>AMC’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-walking-dead\"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>, which was a hit at the level of <em>Game of Thrones</em> for much of its run but has never commanded as big a budget, it’s harder for basic cable networks to compete at that funding level.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple: Basic cable networks like FX or AMC still receive much of their budget from “carriage fees,” which is what your cable company pays each network per subscriber. Such fees are usually under $1, but when there are enough subscribers around the country, they can add up. Toss in advertising dollars and selling these series’ broadcast rights to streaming platforms and other distributers<strong> </strong>around the world, and a basic cable network has a lot of different ways to make money.</p>\n<p>But the carriage fee component means that one aspect of this overall picture is essentially fixed — and is now gradually decreasing as more cable users cut the cord. </p>\n<p>HBO, which makes the bulk of its money off subscriber fees and has a package designed exclusively for those who’ve cut the cable cord (HBO Now), is much less burdened by this decrease, while Netflix, funded by a combination of subscriber fees and massive amounts of venture capital, isn’t burdened by it at all. </p>\n<p>FX is still playing catch-up in this arena, and were it to become a closer corporate cousin to Hulu under the Disney banner, it might finally have a natural streaming partner. (At present, FX more or less plays the field, selling rights to its programs to Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon, all three of the major streaming players.)</p>\n<p>I asked Landgraf if he thought FX would have been able to continue to support a hit like <em>Game of Thrones</em> at the budgetary level it would require, had it been on his network. He said he didn’t think FX would have a problem doing so, but the question, for now, remains purely hypothetical. </p>\n<p>FX’s biggest current hits, <em>American Horror Story</em> and <em>American Crime Story</em>, reset with every season, meaning that they can alleviate some of the increase in actors’ salaries that come with ongoing series (though they do have to build entirely new sets each season, which is expensive). </p>\n<p>But <em>Game of Thrones</em> is a unique enough case study in the history of television — no show this big has also required this level of expense — that it’s possible the needs of the show would cause <em>any</em> network to sink more money into it than it had ever spent before. After all, even HBO hasn’t previously had a series budgeted at $15 million an episode. Generally, big hit shows get almost everything they need, and what <em>Game of Thrones</em> needs is lots and lots of money.</p>\n<p>Still: We haven’t had to see what FX would do with a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-size hit because it hasn’t had one yet. And in order to facilitate finding a series that humongous, it would make sense for a Disney-charged FX to finally have room to expand directly into territory largely owned by HBO and Showtime, probably with an able assist from Hulu. </p>\n<p>When you consider that the network is led by Landgraf, one of the most respected TV executives in the business and someone who’s built an incredibly autonomous operation with an extremely high batting average for making great television, it would make even more sense for Disney to bolster FX with more resources and get out of the way.</p>\n<p>Yet at the same time, it’s hard to imagine FX being of much value to Disney <em>without</em> Landgraf, who would almost certainly be heavily wooed by other networks were he to decide not to follow FX over to the Disney lot. </p>\n<p>Since government regulations mean that everybody at FX — including Landgraf — has to keep operating as though they’ll continue to work for Fox for the foreseeable future, there’s no good way for anybody to know exactly what Disney has planned, beyond a handful of reassurances from Disney head Bob Iger and the vague rumor that Disney wouldn’t mind a prestige TV maker of its very own. I wouldn’t count it as particularly likely that Disney completely scraps FX, but as worst-case scenarios go, it’s not impossible either.</p>\n<h3>Landgraf says he’s not an empire builder. But he might have to become one anyway.</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"2018 Winter TCA Tour - Day 2\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UykewY8oh7BjtMxyImWQLgbitOc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10004787/901702362.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>John Landgraf appears at the 2018 Television Critics Association winter press tour.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“We take time. We’re methodical. We go step by step. There’s a reason why we have almost no failure,” Landgraf told me post-press conference, in a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of FX compared to the models of HBO and Netflix. “The reason is that we don’t buy things sight unseen for a kajillion dollars. We go through a process that allows virtually everything we work on to be good.”</p>\n<p>Landgraf estimates that since he joined the channel in 2004, it has made 30 drama pilots, with 25 of those going to series. FX Productions has stepped up its output, to the degree that FX almost exclusively picks up series from its sister studio (which has also sold series to Netflix, TBS, and others). The network is in a place where “we grow our own food,” as Landgraf puts it.</p>\n<p>FX does, of course, enter the crazy bidding wars that other networks do. Landgraf admits to me that FX put in a bid on <em>The Crown</em>, which ultimately went to Netflix, and several years ago the network <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/fxs-john-landgraf-talks-bidding-war-hbos-true-detective/\">went after <em>True Detective</em></a>, which landed at HBO. But its typical process is to develop a project in house with one of its trusted creative voices, like Ryan Murphy, who currently has four series in series production at the network, with another in production under the FX Productions banner for Netflix. </p>\n<p>This is by design. FX limits the numbers of series it makes, which has led to its high batting average but also its surprisingly small footprint compared to its most obvious rivals. </p>\n<p>“In general, I’m not an empire builder,” Landgraf said. “I’m not someone who is interested in financing a slate and is fine as long as there’s enough success to offset the failure. I wanna win ’em all.”</p>\n<p>This is perhaps why he’s been sounding the alarm about Netflix for almost as long as the streaming service has been programming its own series. If there’s a common thread between FX and HBO, it’s that the two networks, by virtue of having to turn a profit, can’t float along on a seemingly endless sea of venture capital like Netflix can.</p>\n<p>“When you’re in a situation where even if 80 percent of your series are on year-end best lists, that turns out to be 11 series for you, and Netflix has 41,” Landgraf said, “even if 20 percent of their series are on year-end best lists, [that’s still nearly 10]. ... I don’t think we need their level of volume. But I think we need a little bit more volume.” </p>\n<p>Presumably, that sea of venture capital will dry up at some point, and the big question is just who will be left behind in the wake of Netflix, which could drive a bunch of players out of business or just contract quite a few into a handful of larger media behemoths. </p>\n<p>That, presumably, is where FX is headed, as it seems likely to become part of the Disney empire. If that gives FX the money it needs to compete with Netflix, even a little bit, then the merger might end up being the best thing that could happen to FX. </p>\n<p>“If there are 77 programming services that made or marketed a show that one of you [TV critics] put on your year-end best lists, that’s just too many. It’s gonna compress down to a handful of relevant, adult, premium scripted brands,” Landgraf said. “We have all of the wherewithal from the creative, curatorial, marketing, and branding standpoint to be one of those brands. We just need enough resources that we can continue to command the consumer’s attention.”</p>\n<p>Then again, as I’m sure Landgraf would tell you, that’s a whole lot of really big ifs. </p>",

What power does Trump’s Cabinet have to declare him incapable of performing his duties?</p>\n<p>The answer to both questions turns on an interpretation of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv\">25th Amendment </a>to the Constitution, which was ratified in the aftermath of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. The amendment sought to establish a process whereby the president could be removed or replaced in the event of death or some other incapacitation. </p>\n<p>It was primarily about ensuring continuity in government, but Section 4 of the amendment stipulates that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can declare the president unfit for office and then send a formal notice to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate. Once that happens, the vice president becomes the “Acting President.”</p>\n<p>Are we inching closer to that possibility right now? And if so, is there a legitimate case to make that the 25th Amendment ought to be invoked?</p>\n<p>To understand what the 25th Amendment is, how it was intended to be used, and if it can be plausibly invoked to remove Trump from office, I reached out to Jay Berman, a former chief of staff to Sen. Birch Bayh (D-IN) and one of the co-authors of the amendment. </p>\n<p>A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows. </p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>You helped write the 25th Amendment. Why was it created?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>It was created very specifically in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination, which was a real crisis point for our government and for the country. But it was also created at a moment that was perceived to be the beginning of the nuclear age, and so we recognized that we needed processes that fit the realities of the new world. Suddenly the stakes were higher, and the power of the presidency was enormous. We needed procedures and checks in place so that the government could still function in the event of an emergency or some other unanticipated crisis. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>But certainly one of the goals was to have the ability to remove an unstable or unfit president from office if it was deemed necessary for the sake of the country.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>That was definitely one of the purposes.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What does it actually say about the conditions under which a president can be removed from office?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Well, that’s the big question, isn’t it? It’s much more about process than it is about setting into the Constitution a trigger mechanism. The president has to be unfit to fulfill his obligations. Everything about the 25th Amendment implies that removing an elected president is primarily a political act. Of course, it should be informed by medical opinion on both the physical and mental health of the president, but ultimately the act of removing the president is a political act.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>So how does that process get started? Who initiates the use of the 25th Amendment?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>The mechanism for triggering it is the vice president taking the first step and getting a majority of the Cabinet to assert that the president is incapable of fulfilling his duties. If that happens, they then send a formal written notice to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate. </p>\n<p>If the president doesn’t dispute this, the vice president becomes the “Acting President.” But if the president disputes this declaration, then two-thirds of the Senate must agree that he’s unfit for office in order for him to be removed. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>It’s relatively easy to determine that a president is physically incapable of performing his duties, but how do we decide that a president is mentally unfit?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Everything begins with the vice president. The vice president has to determine in his own mind that the president can’t meet his constitutional responsibilities because of a variety of mental reasons. If the 25th Amendment had included a set of circumstances in which the trigger mechanism said, “You know, he’s wacko, he tweets insane things, he says insane things, we have to remove him,” it never would have passed.</p>\n<p>So we determined that it would be a political decision left to the vice president, the Cabinet, and Congress. That’s how we designed it, for better or worse.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Does it allow for Congress to act in the event that the vice president is negligent or unwilling?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>The 25th Amendment didn’t provide the specific trigger you’re asking about it, but it does authorize Congress, under Section 4, to create a body that could examine the president’s fitness for office. But in a partisan environment like this, it’s hard to believe that this could ever happen. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“I think he was elected to do these dumb things. He hasn’t become dumber or meaner since he was elected — this is who he’s always been.”</q></aside></div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>I’ll ask you straightforwardly: Do you think the 25th Amendment should be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>No.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Why not?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>At this moment, I don’t think he meets the test of a president who’s incapable of fulfilling his responsibilities. I think he was elected to do these dumb things. He hasn’t become dumber or meaner since he was elected — this is who he’s always been. This was who he was when he ran, and may well have been the reason people elected him. </p>\n<p>The problem is that we have a ridiculous electoral system and a bizarre set of circumstances that conspired to make this situation possible. But I can’t honestly say that the 25th Amendment is the answer right now. The answer right now is impeachment. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Well, that leaves us in almost an absurd position. The country made a grievous mistake, we all know it, and yet we’re forced to watch this tragicomedy unfold knowing how disastrously bad it could get.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>Correct.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>You’re not cheering me up, Jay.</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>I think we ought to be talking more about how horrible our electoral system is, a system that commits the person with less votes to beat the candidate with more votes. This is the fundamental issue which people have neglected to think about in the rush to the 25th Amendment. None of this would have happened if we had a direct popular election, but we don’t do it that way, and now we’re trying to fit the 25th Amendment into this unique set of circumstances.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>I understand all that, but we are where we are and I’m trying to think through the options we have. The 25th Amendment, whatever its original intent, still allows for a determination to be made about a president’s mental fitness. If someone like Trump, who each day appears more unhinged, more unstable, more deluded, cannot be declared mentally unfit, is it conceivable that anyone could?</p>\n<h4>Jay Berman</h4>\n<p>It’s very alarming, what we’re witnessing right now. But the bar for the 25th Amendment is set extraordinarily high. I agree that the president appears unhinged, but he’s always appeared unhinged, and he was still elected in a legitimate political act. If, for example, he decided he wanted to go to war with North Korea against the advice of literally everyone else, then we would be in different territory in terms of the 25th Amendment. But right now I just don’t see it.

There are indications that he is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/8/16862632/trump-russia-collusion-probe-investigation-mueller\">preparing to haul in the president</a> for an interview.</p>\n<p>There remains, however, a crucial hole in the case for collusion — at least, the part of it known to the public. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/27/16670950/trump-russia-timeline\">We have not seen or heard any evidence</a> that President Trump personally participated in some kind of illegal election hacking scheme in coordination with Russian agents.</p>\n<p>But there’s another kind of case against the president — the argument that his various attempts to undermine the Russia investigation, like firing FBI Director James Comey, constitute criminal obstruction of justice. If Mueller feels he has enough evidence, then he could seek permission to indict and prosecute Trump. It’s not clear that charges can actually be brought against a sitting president, but Mueller’s findings could nevertheless be turned over to Congress — and serve as the centerpiece of any impeachment proceedings against Trump. </p>\n<p>That means it’s obstruction, not collusion, that poses the biggest legal and political threat to President Trump. </p>\n<p>“If Trump exercises his power — even his lawful power — with a corrupt motive of interfering with an investigation, that’s obstruction,” says Lisa Kern Griffin, an expert on criminal law at Duke University. “The attempt is sufficient, and it seems to be a matter of public record already.”</p>\n<p>There are basically two reasons Griffin and other legal observers believe Mueller has such a good case obstruction case. First, the evidence of obstruction is, from what we know publicly, far stronger than the evidence that Trump himself was involved in with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Second, the crime of obstruction is legally straightforward, whereas it’s not obvious which laws Trump would have violated by accepting Russian assistance during the election. </p>\n<p>The public, obviously, doesn’t know everything Mueller does. It could be that the collusion case is a lot clearer, or the obstruction case a lot murkier, than it appears from the outside.</p>\n<p>But what we do know suggests that Mueller is taking the obstruction charge seriously, and that his chances of making his case are quite good — unless Trump decides to fire him or his boss.</p>\n<h3>The evidence that Trump obstructed justice seems stronger than the evidence of collusion </h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Donald Trump Delivers Commencement Address At U.S. Coast Guard Academy\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ytPLnauKdSWfAo_kDU6WuqAbeTM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10002557/684257682.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>We know for a fact that Mueller is looking into potential obstruction charges. </p>\n<p>On January 4, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html\">the New York Times</a>’s Michael Schmidt reported that Trump ordered the White House counsel, Don McGahn, to convince Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. When McGahn failed, “the president erupted in anger in front of numerous White House officials, saying he needed his attorney general to protect him,” Schmidt writes. “Mr. Trump said he had expected his top law enforcement official to safeguard him.”</p>\n<p>The incident suggests that the president wanted law enforcement officials to protect him from criminal charges. And indeed, Schmidt reports that the episode was initially discovered by Mueller “as he investigates whether Mr. Trump obstructed the F.B.I.’s Russia inquiry.” </p>\n<p>The irony, according to many experts, is that this kind of effort to block the Russia investigation has likely created a bigger legal problem for Trump than anything he may have done with Russians.</p>\n<p>“So-called ‘offenses against the administration of justice’ — like obstruction of justice or lying to the FBI — are often easier to prove than the underlying criminality that the subject was trying to hide,” says Jens David Ohlin, a professor of law at Cornell. “In Trump’s case, this is undoubtedly true.”</p>\n<p>There’s clear evidence that some of Trump’s campaign staff were in contact with Russian officials, and even interested in receiving their help in the election. The best example is the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr. met with a Kremlin-linked attorney who was promising to provide dirt from the Russian government on Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>But to link Trump himself to collusion, you’d need to prove that he had personally approved of this meeting, or that the Trump campaign as a whole was involved in a broader plot to work with the Russian government. In the absence of this evidence, experts say it would be very hard to charge the president with any kind of collusion-related crime. And no such evidence exists, at least in the public record.</p>\n<p>“Nothing, to my knowledge, has come out that implicated [Trump] directly,” says Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and current associate dean of Yale University.</p>\n<p>The public evidence that Trump committed obstruction of justice — defined as “corruptly” attempting to “influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice” — is quite a bit stronger, particularly when it comes to the Comey firing.</p>\n<p>Technically, the FBI director serves at the pleasure of the president and can be fired at any time and for any reason. However, the general belief among experts is that it’s <em>not</em> legal for the president to use this power in an attempt to shield himself or his family members from criminal investigation. Crucially, it does not matter whether Trump successfully shielded himself from scrutiny — all that matters is that he tried to.</p>\n<p>“The obstruction statutes are very broad,” Griffin explains. “It matters whether Trump ‘endeavors’ to impede the DOJ and congressional investigations at any turn.”</p>\n<p>This all hinges on what was in the president’s mind when he fired Comey. If Trump did it because he thought Comey was doing a poor job supervising the Russia investigation, that’s perfectly legal. If he did it because he was worried that Comey’s investigation might end up uncovering some kind of misdeeds by the Trump family — whether Russia-related, financial, or otherwise — then that’s obstruction.</p>\n<p>Typically, proving intent is difficult for prosecutors, because establishing what a person was thinking at a particular moment is inherently challenging. But Trump has made things easier for Mueller — by repeatedly, even publicly, admitting that he fired Comey out of hostility to the Russia investigation.</p>\n<p>There’s an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in which Trump admits to removing the FBI chief because he felt <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia\">“this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”</a> There was Trump’s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov the day after the firing, where he told the foreign diplomat that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-comey.html\">“I faced great pressure because of Russia [and now] that’s taken off.”</a> And then there are his endless tweets about how he thinks the Russia investigation is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/889215815022727168?lang=en\">“witch hunt”</a> and should be shut down.</p>\n<p>“He’s kind of making the case himself for Mueller [on] obstruction,” Rangappa concludes.</p>\n<p>Firing Comey <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html\">isn’t the only possible Trump action</a> that could land him in hot water on obstruction charges. But the firing is the clearest example based on what we know right now — and one that seems more likely to form the backbone of any charges against Trump than anything directly related to Russian collusion.</p>\n<h3>We are still a very long way away from indictment or impeachment</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"FBI Director Robert Muller Holds News Conference\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ep19jxsA8zpiQkNuLcT99yZt4TM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10006519/81708297.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Alex Wong/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Even if there were evidence of Trump personally plotting with Russia — and it may well be, squirreled away in Mueller’s files — it’s not clear whether this would constitute a crime. “Collusion” is not a legal term; Mueller would have to figure out which specific law Trump’s actions violated, which according to legal experts could be trickier than it might seem.</p>\n<p>By contrast, there’s no similar lack of clarity about obstruction of justice. The articles of impeachment against<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/richard-nixon-bill-clinton-faced-impeachment-obstruction-justice/story?id=47460022\"> both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton</a> included allegations of obstruction. </p>\n<p>Still, as strong as Mueller’s obstruction case appears to be, there are several major hurdles he’d have to clear before bringing a case.</p>\n<p>Under the law governing special counsels, Mueller does not have the power to simply announce that he thinks the president has committed a crime and then indict him. He doesn’t even have authority to issue a report saying that the president committed crimes, a step well short of criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>To do either, he would need approval from the top Department of Justice official supervising the investigation. Typically, this would be the attorney general — but since Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, it falls to his second in command, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.</p>\n<p>“[Mueller] really can’t just walk into a federal court and go through the normal criminal process,” Rangappa explains. “He brings his findings to Rosenstein, he says, ‘I want to bring these charges,’ or, ‘I’m declining to bring these charges,’ and [Rosenstein] can approve or not.”</p>\n<p>This is a crucial point of vulnerability in the case against Trump. Legally, Trump would need Rosenstein’s approval to fire Mueller — but Trump could fire Rosenstein all on his own. You’re already seeing support for this course of action building; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/14/16762840/mueller-trump-hannity-gaetz-jordan-perry-fire\">there’s a faction of Republicans in Congress</a> who believe that Mueller’s probe is biased against Trump and that its leader needs to be fired.</p>\n<p>The decision would then fall to the next person in the DOJ hierarchy, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rachel-brand-associate-attorney-general-sessions-rosenstein/story?id=48754119\">Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand</a>, to fire Mueller. If she refused, Trump could fire her and try again with her successor. The president could also muzzle Mueller, and forestall an indictment, by firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointing a friendly attorney general who wouldn’t have to recuse himself from supervising the Russia probe. </p>\n<p>These are hard things to do. Firing Mueller might require firing a massive portion of the DOJ, and new attorneys general need congressional approval. But they are potential avenues through which Trump could use his powers to take control of the investigation.</p>\n<p>Assuming Rosenstein remains in office and concludes that Mueller’s evidence against Trump is sufficient to support an obstruction case, the question becomes what to do about it.</p>\n<p>Current DOJ policy is that sitting presidents cannot be indicted in criminal court as a matter of constitutional law. Some scholars dispute that; my colleague Dylan Matthews has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/17/15654158/trump-prosecuted-constitution-impeachment-prosecutor\">an excellent overview of the debate</a>. But the fact that an indictment is constitutionally dubious means that Rosenstein is unlikely to greenlight bringing charges.</p>\n<p>An alternative would be Rosenstein issuing a report detailing evidence of Trump’s alleged crimes, a document lawmakers could use in any impeachment proceedings against Trump.</p>\n<p>Impeachment is the clearest and most constitutionally straightforward punishment for crimes by a sitting president, and the one most likely to lead to Trump’s removal from office. This means that no matter how strong Mueller’s evidence is, Trump’s fate would most likely to be decided on Capitol Hill — in a profoundly political vote.</p>",

The question is how much.</p> <p>Few economics findings have penetrated the public consciousness in recent years as much as this one: Income inequality has exploded in recent decades, and the top 1 percent in particular have made out like bandits.</p>\n<p>Economists Emmanuel Saez of UC Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics have been <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf\">documenting a massive rise in income inequality</a> since 2003 using hyper-detailed IRS records. According to their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart\">latest data</a>, compiled with Berkeley’s Gabriel Zucman, the top 1 percent’s share of national income, after taxes are taken into account, rose from 9.1 percent in 1979 to 15.7 percent in 2014.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to overstate the influence of this line of research. It won Saez the John Bates Clark medal, America’s most prestigious prize for academic economists, made Piketty’s <em>Capital in the 21</em><em>st</em><em> Century</em> an international best-seller, and helped frame the debate over inequality coming out of Occupy Wall Street and the Obama White House’s proposals. President Obama’s budget director, Peter Orszag, wrote in 2009 that Saez’s work <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/blog/09/04/27/CongratulationstoEmmanuelSaez\">“had no small influence on the President’s Budget.”</a></p>\n<p>But <a href=\"http://davidsplinter.com/AutenSplinter-Tax_Data_and_Inequality.pdf\">another paper</a> released recently suggests the spike in inequality Piketty and Saez have documented is a dramatic overestimate.</p>\n<p>Gerald Auten and David Splinter, economists at Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis, used the same IRS tax data as Piketty, Saez, and Zucman. They found that the top 1 percent’s share of after-tax income rose from 8.4 percent in 1979 to 10.1 percent in 2015 — an increase less than a third as large.</p>\n<p>What looks on paper like a big increase in inequality in the 1980s and onward, Auten and Splinter argue, is really just money being shuffled around in response to Ronald Reagan-era changes to tax law. In 1980, the top <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates\">individual income tax rate</a> was 69.13 percent; by 1989, it had fallen by more than half, to 28 percent. </p>\n<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, companies usually reinvested their profits rather than giving raises to executives — the high tax rates meant those salaries would be largely taxed away. Reinvesting the money ultimately benefited shareholders in the company by increasing the company’s value, and benefiting shareholders means benefiting rich people. Owning corporate shares was much rarer for middle-class people in the ‘60s and ‘70s before the rise of 401(k)s and IRAs.</p>\n<p>After the tax cuts, companies started directing more money to raises. Rather than exploding actual inequality, Auten and Splinter write, the Reagan tax changes mostly shifted money that used to go to rich people through stocks so that it instead went to rich people in the form of salary. </p>\n<p>That looks like a big increase in the rich’s slice of the pie on paper, because the higher salaries show up on tax returns, but the increasing value to shareholders doesn’t, at least until the shares are sold. </p>\n<p>Auten and Splinter argue that the salary boost is largely an illusion.<strong> </strong>These compensation changes and other measurement issues, they find, account for 85 percent of the apparent rise in the top 1 percent’s share of after-tax income since 1960.</p>\n<p>For their part, Piketty, Saez, and Zucman <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/PSZ2018DataAppendix.pdf\">argue</a> that the Auten and Splinter data is incomplete, and relies on an unrealistic way of treating corporate taxes. They insist that the finding that inequality has dramatically increased is robust, and holds up even after considering these issues.</p>\n<p>The literature on income inequality is growing rapidly, and is fraught with political implications. Auten and Splinter are serious, nonpartisan researchers, but you could easily imagine conservative politicians latching onto their findings to argue that inequality isn’t that big of a deal. Their work is not the last word on the subject, and there’s plenty of analysis left to do. But it illustrates just how tricky it is to get a complete picture of what’s happening with inequality.</p>\n<h3>The case that we’re exaggerating the rise in inequality</h3>\n<p>Auten and Splinter adjust for the incentive the high tax rates of the 1960s and 1970s created for corporations to hoard money by treating all profits earned by corporations as income going to people who own corporations. They use dividends paid out and capital gains tax paid to estimate how much corporate stock individual taxpayers own, and then distributed the profits to those taxpayers accordingly.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the only adjustment they make. Marriage rates, Auten and Splinter note, have fallen substantially over the last half-century. About 69 percent of tax filers were married in 1960, compared to 39 percent in 2015. But there’s been basically no decline among the richest Americans: Ninety percent of the top 1 percent of filers were married in 1960, and 86 percent were in 2015.</p>\n<p>That can bias results when you’re comparing tax filers<strong> </strong>— which can either be single people, or married couples (including married couples where both people work) — to each other. If rich people are likelier to be married, that artificially increases the incomes of rich tax units, by making it likelier those units will include two people rather than just one.</p>\n<p>“In order to control for these declining marriage rates, our analysis defines income groups based on the number of adults, rather than the number of tax units,” they write. “This means that each percentile includes the same number of adults instead of the same number of tax units.” This adjustment alone reduces the top one percent’s share of income by about 10 percent, across the board.</p>\n<p>To get a full picture of incomes, Auten and Splinter do many of the same adjustments that Piketty, Saez, and Zucman do in their most recent work, including incorporating untaxed benefits like health insurance, adjusting for income that’s underreported to the IRS, adding in government transfers, and so forth.</p>\n<p>They find that adding corporate profits, including ones taxed away by the federal government, substantially increases the top 1 percent’s share of income in 1960 and 1979, but only mildly increases its share in 2015. The effect of adding them in is to shrink the growth in the top 1 percent’s share considerably:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"How including corporate earnings changes measures of inequality\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsxJh3DlSyqQGH861Y63h_uESNU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10002967/Screenshot_2018_01_09_10.50.55.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"http://davidsplinter.com/AutenSplinter-Tax_Data_and_Inequality.pdf\">Auten and Splinter 2017</a></cite>\n</figure>\n<p>But other adjustments, like adding employer payroll taxes back into employees’ pre-tax income and including health insurance, also make a difference. The big change isn’t a result of just a handful of changes, but the cumulative effect of all these adjustments. Before the adjustments, the baseline Piketty-Saez data found an 11.3 percentage point boost in the top 1 percent’s share of income from 1979 to 2015. After, the boost shrank to five points.</p>\n<p>Adding in transfer income from government programs, and then applying taxes to get post-tax income, shrinks the scale of the increase still further. Compare the Piketty-Saez numbers below (with the 11.3 point increase) to the after-tax income measure that Auten and Splinter devise (with only a 1.7 point increase):</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Comparing Auten/Splinter to Piketty-Saez\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kz9cOaIHpxLQxGJvVxTo7ILUxLM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10003019/Screenshot_2018_01_09_10.57.54.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"http://davidsplinter.com/AutenSplinter-Tax_Data_and_Inequality.pdf\">Auten and Splinter</a></cite>\n</figure>\n<h3>Piketty, Saez, and Zucman respond</h3>\n<p>Piketty, Saez, and their coauthor Zucman aren’t as far away from the Auten and Splinter analysis as you might think. In <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart\">recent work</a>, they’ve moved beyond merely measuring pre-tax “market income” using tax returns to trying to use tax returns, survey data, and other sources to construct what they call “distributive national accounts.” This research tries to take every dollar in the American economy in a given year and assign it to specific individuals, and then look at the distribution of that income.</p>\n<p>This approach yields a more modest increase in the top 1 percent’s share than the doubling from 9 percent to 20.3 percent that the market income data shows. Instead, the national accounts data shows that the top 1 percent’s share of after-tax national income grew from 9.1 percent in 1979 to 15.7 percent in 2014.</p>\n<p>But that’s still a bigger boost than the one Auten and Splinter document. So what accounts for the difference?</p>\n<p>Each set of researchers has their own answer. Auten and Splinter note that they’re not tracking total national income the way that Piketty, Saez, and Zucman are. But once they adjust their data to do so, they find that “after-tax national income shares [are] essentially unchanged: remaining at 8.5 percent in 1960 and increasing slightly from 10.1 to 10.2 percent in 2015. In 2014, top one percent after-tax national income shares were estimated by PSZ to be 15.7 percent, as compared to our estimate of 10.2 percent—a 5.5 percentage point difference.”</p>\n<p>They find that about half the difference is explained by how the two teams distribute underreported income. </p>\n<p>Piketty, Saez, and Zucman assume that underreported business income is distributed roughly the same way as normal business income: so business owners who don’t fess up on their full income to the IRS have the same income distribution as fully honest business owners. </p>\n<p>Auten and Splinter don’t think that’s right; they argue that lower-income business owners are likelier to underreport. The rest of the gap is accounted for by differences in how to handle married couples, how to deal with distributing government deficits to individuals, and treatment of retirement income.</p>\n<p>Piketty, Saez, and Zucman responded with a <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/PSZ2018DataAppendix.pdf\">detailed data appendix</a> defending their numbers. They argue that, while random audit data suggests pretty even rates of tax evasion across income, IRS audits aren’t as effective at unraveling more intricate attempts at tax evasion undertaken by rich people. If you consider that rich people’s efforts at evasion are likelier to be successful, then their approach of assigning more underreported income to the rich looks more reasonable.</p>\n<p>They also disagree with the pre-tax income data that Auten and Splinter produced. “They have an unorthodox treatment of the corporate tax, which they assume falls a lot on current retirees (which are typically relatively low-income),” Zucman wrote in an email. “As a result the top 1% only pays 17% of the corporate tax in their series in 2013. This is too low. CBO, JCT, Treasury, and ourselves have a more justified treatment where the corporate tax falls primarily on capital owners, and the top 1% pays 40%-45% of the corporate tax.” But, as Saez adds, “This is relevant for the pre-tax income series comparison, not the after-tax one.”</p>\n<h3>A lot of questions about inequality come down to seemingly technical details</h3>\n<p>Those disagreements probably sound rather technical and nit-picky. But they make a huge difference to the overall numbers. Again, Piketty, Saez, and Zucman document a big boost in top-end income inequality, while Auten and Splinter show a much milder increase in the top 1 percent’s share since 1979 or so.</p>\n<p>That being said, it’s important to remember that Piketty, Saez, and Zucman are hardly the only people documenting a major increase in inequality. The <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361\">Congressional Budget Office</a>, for instance, finds that the top 1 percent’s share of after-tax income increased from 7.4 percent in 1979 to 15.1 percent in 2012; it declined to 12.4 percent in 2013 as a result of Obama’s tax hikes.</p>\n<p>And signs of inequality’s pernicious effects outside of the raw income data are clear. Just look at the relative <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/9/16860994/life-expectancy-us-income-inequality\">stagnation of life expectancy</a> for poor Americans, even as rich Americans are living longer and longer.</p>\n<p>Further, the Auten/Splinter data doesn’t touch on middle-class wage stagnation, another major them of the Piketty/Saez/Zucman work. The Auten/Splinter paper might reasonably make you question the scale of the increase in inequality, but the fact that it’s increased is hard to dispute.</p>\n<p>The Auten/Splinter data does suggest that we might be underestimating how well the rich were doing in the 1960s and 1970s, and thus overestimating how different today’s age of inequality is from that period, a conclusion shared by <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/measuring-income-and-wealth-at-the-top-using-administrative-and-survey-data/\">some other recent research</a>. </p>\n<p>Among other things, that would suggest that the high individual tax rates of that period might have been less effective at tempering inequality than commonly thought. They certainly did something, but it appears rich people of that period found ways to collect the money tax-free regardless, specifically by parking it in corporations.</p>",

An idea that a couple of years ago would have seemed all but impossible now has plenty of political observers asking: Why not?</p>\n<p>Oprah certainly possesses a level of star power that rivals, even surpasses, Trump’s. She has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-underestimate-the-possibility-of-oprah-2020/2018/01/08/9abd9d26-f4ba-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html?utm_term=.ea407e10ab31\">wide name recognition</a> and is well-liked, especially among coalitions important to Democrats — women, African Americans. Some, however, are already begging Winfrey not to run. America shouldn’t be a place where celebrity is a prerequisite for politics, they say, and we don’t need another political novice in the White House.</p>\n<p>Responding to the buzz, President Trump on Tuesday said Winfrey’s hypothetical campaign would be “lots of fun.” “I did one of her last shows. ... I like Oprah. I don’t think she’s going to run,” he said. </p>\n<p>At least some in the political world seem to be taking the Oprah 2020 idea seriously — showing just how much Trump’s election has rewritten the rules of celebrities in politics. Oprah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQFBWTTZ6yY\">proved in 2008</a> that she has plenty of political power; her Golden Globes speech has sparked debate about how she should use it. </p>\n<h3>Oprah delivered one heck of a speech</h3>\n<p>“I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon!” Winfrey declared while accepting the Golden Globes’ Cecil B. DeMille Award for career achievement on Sunday. (You can read the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861862/oprah-winfrey-golden-globes-speech\">full transcript</a> of the speech on Vox.) While there has long been mild speculation that she might harbor political aspirations, the nearly 10-minute speech brought those whispers to a roar. </p>\n<p>Oprah opened her address describing a scene of herself sitting on the linoleum floor of her mother’s house in Milwaukee as a child in 1964, watching Sidney Poitier become the first black man to win the Oscar for best actor.</p>\n<p>“I tried many, many times to explain what a moment like that means to a little girl, a kid watching from the cheap seats as my mom came through the door bone-tired from cleaning other people’s houses,” she said. Poitier in 1982 received the same Cecil B. DeMille Award that Winfrey was given on Sunday. </p>\n<p>“It is not lost on me that at this moment, there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given the same award,” she said.</p>\n<p>Oprah, a talk show host, actress, producer, philanthropist, and all-around media heavyweight, spoke of her own career achievements but also placed herself in a historical context of race and class and the current context of gender and women’s rights. She recounted the story of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/8/16861960/recy-taylor-rape-oprah-golden-globes\">civil rights hero</a> Recy Taylor, who died just days before the awards show, and emphasized the pervasiveness of gender bias in Hollywood and all walks of life. </p>\n<p>“When that new day finally dawns, it will be because a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, ‘Me too,’ again,” she closed.</p>\n<p>Soon after her speech, NBC fired off an eyebrow-raising tweet reading, “Nothing but respect for OUR future president.” </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing but respect for OUR future president. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobes?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoldenGlobes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/h4hkjewu0K\">pic.twitter.com/h4hkjewu0K</a></p>— NBC (@nbc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbc/status/950172700625915904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>(On Monday, the network <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbc/status/950391488990519297\">removed the tweet</a> and said it was sent by a third-party agency in reference to a joke made during the Golden Globes monologue.)</p>\n<p>The network wasn’t the only one to pick up on the theme. </p>\n<p>“[I don’t know] if she’s running, but who could count her out if she did,” tweeted Nate Cohn, a politics writer for the New York Times’s data journalism section, the Upshot. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IDK if she's running, but who could count her out if she did</p>— Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/950205003951673344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Alex Burns, a political reporter at the Times, openly pondered which Democrats would really give Oprah a run for her money.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Still, Ms. Winfrey could face a difficult fight for the Democratic nomination, especially against _________<br><br>It is tough to finish that sentence</p>— Alex Burns (@alexburnsNYT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexburnsNYT/status/950206534923022336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said dismissing her out of hand “seems short-sighted.” </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is all by way of saying I have no idea if Oprah would be a good candidate or president (no idea if she’s even contemplating running!)

Oprah herself told <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/entertainment/oprah-running-president/index.html\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> in a June podcast that she will “never run for public office.” </p>\n<p>But Sunday night, her longtime partner Stedman Graham was singing a different tune. “It’s up to the people,” he told the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mog-golden-globes-oprah-president-20180107-story.html\">Los Angeles Times</a>. “She would absolutely do it.” </p>\n<p>King on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gayle-king-addresses-oprah-2020-presidential-run-speculation/\">walked back</a> Graham’s remarks, saying that he would “never so cavalierly say” that Oprah would run for president. She added that Winfrey isn’t “actively considering” a run for president but didn’t completely shut the door. “I do think she’s intrigued by the idea,” she said. </p>\n<p>To be sure, Oprah could start smaller as well. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Oprah4TNsen\">Twitter account</a> has popped up calling for her to run for the US Senate in Tennessee. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) has announced he isn’t seeking reelection in 2018, and Winfrey spent part of her childhood in the state and attended Tennessee State University.</p>\n<h3>The case for Oprah</h3>\n<p>Winfrey will be 65 in 2020, several years younger than Trump. If Trump’s victory taught us anything, it’s that political experience isn’t exactly a precursor for landing the top job in the United States. </p>\n<p>“Yes, we can! Am I the only one who had that feeling? It feels like Oprah 2020,” <em>The Daily Show’s </em>Trevor Noah <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trevor-noah-explains-why-oprah-is-the-perfect-opponent-for-trump\">remarked</a> on Monday, reacting to Winfrey’s Golden Globes speech. “I can see how Oprah seems like the perfect opponent for Donald Trump — I mean, she’s everything he’s not. She’s black. She’s a woman. She likes to read. They’re the complete opposite!”</p>\n<p>When it comes to name recognition, and star power, Oprah is possibly unmatched. She has been a familiar, and welcomed, presence in American households for decades, is largely a uniting figure, and appeals to a number of coalitions vital to Democratic success — women, African Americans, perhaps young people.</p>\n<p>While she lacks experience in politics, her career trajectory demonstrates that she is an exceptionally talented individual with an ability to inspire, lead, and create, and change isn’t a bad thing to many voters on the left and right. </p>\n<p>“Both President Obama and President Trump won in part by being perceived as non-typical candidates who could change politics,” Jim Messina, campaign manager for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/08/president-oprah-2020-216257\">Politico</a>, which surveyed various political pundits and observers on Oprah’s presidential prospects.</p>\n<p>“People will take her seriously not because she is a celebrity but because of who she is — because she’s genuinely a self-made success story and because she’s made a career out of helping other people,” Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, told the publication.</p>\n<p>With what <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/oprah-winfrey/\">Forbes</a> estimates to be a net worth of $2.8 billion, Winfrey could potentially self-fund her campaign — not to say that she wouldn’t have plenty of eager donors. (Former Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/950341279757500416\">pointed out</a> that whoever runs for the White House in 2020 should divest their assets, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/12/9/13799904/trump-corruption-conflict-of-interest\">as President Trump has not</a>.) </p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/950206171348160512\">FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten</a> noted on Twitter, Winfrey is a popular figure. A <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2436\">2017 Quinnipiac University</a> poll found that 52 percent of American voters, including 72 percent of Democrats, view her favorably, versus 23 percent who do not, or just 7 percent of Democrats. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You could do a lot worse than the favorability ratings Oprah Winfrey posted last year... In fact, she's quite popular... <a href=\"https://t.co/Pz467uXJAn\">https://t.co/Pz467uXJAn</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JVDHVmS2kU\">pic.twitter.com/JVDHVmS2kU</a></p>— (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/950206171348160512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>The poll also found, though, that just 21 percent of voters want her to run, while 69 percent to not. </p>\n<p>She has also proven to be a force in presidential politics in the past. While celebrity endorsements have historically been <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/do-celebrity-endorsements-really-matter\">relatively ineffective</a> in swaying votes, Oprah has been the exception to the rule. </p>\n<p>Her endorsement of Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf\">is estimated</a> to have generated more than 1 million votes for Obama as well as increased campaign contributions and voter participation, according to research from University of Maryland economists Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore. (Still, a Gallup poll found that <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/102301/most-voters-moved-oprahs-endorsement-obama.aspx\">most voters</a> were not swung one way or the other by Winfrey.)</p>\n<p>Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was removed from office in 2009, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/US/story?id=6730220\">said</a> that he considered appointing Winfrey to take the Senate seat vacated by Obama after he was elected to the presidency. He said he worried she might not take his call, “because Oprah is Oprah, and I’m only the governor of Illinois.” </p>\n<p>Winfrey isn’t the only celebrity to have floated the idea of a White House run. Actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/12/12/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-for-president-2020-ellen/#94H6va.QKiqH\">told</a> Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show in December that he is “seriously considering” a presidential bid and told <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-for-president-cover\">GQ</a> earlier in the year it was a “real possibility.”</p>\n<p>As odd as it may be to imagine Oprah, The Rock, or any other celebrity on the presidential debate stage, remember there was also a time when Trump on said stage was just as unfathomable.</p>\n<h3>The case against Oprah</h3>\n<p>Though some establishment Democrats suggested Winfrey could be taken seriously, political journalists and commentators rushed to argue why she shouldn’t be.</p>\n<p>One common theme: Democrats might be overcorrecting and seeking out a figure who will be prone to many of the same criticisms they’ve often launched at Trump. She lacks expertise in foreign or domestic policy and knows little of the ins and outs of American politics, and while she certainly knows how to rile up a crowd, it’s unclear what policy substance lies beneath her rhetoric. </p>\n<p>Winfrey has zero political experience, and while the same is true for Trump, it is certainly fair to say that having a novice president has not been, well, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/1/9/16860598/michael-wolff-fire-fury-donald-trump-book\">smooth sailing</a>. </p>\n<p>“She may, in fact, be what Trump pretends to be — a self-made business success story whose words resonate across the country,” wrote Ben Smith, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/the-case-against-president-oprah?utm_term=.acKrQNXr8#.hyPqLopq0\">BuzzFeed’s editor-in-chief</a>, in an article called “The Case Against President Oprah.” </p>\n<p>“But Democrats don’t want to improve on Trump,” he continued. “They want to reverse him. And that’s where governors and senators with deep experience, proven political chops, and an unglamorous sense of normalcy come in.”</p>\n<p>Winfrey also hasn’t been subject to the high level of scrutiny politicians often face. As Vox’s Julia Belluz <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/9/16868216/oprah-winfrey-pseudoscience\">pointed out</a>, she has a long history of enabling junk science. </p>\n<p>Moreover, having a celebrity president has been exhausting. Wouldn’t it be nice to go a week, or even a day, without talking about the goings-on in the White House? “But can we let celebrities just be celebrities?” wrote <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw5n8x/i-cant-believe-i-have-to-explain-why-oprah-shouldnt-be-president\">Eve Peyser </a>at Vice. “Or to put it a little more pointedly, have we learned nothing from Donald Trump?”</p>\n<p>“I love Oprah — love her! — but she is not ready or qualified to be the leader of the free world,” Sophia Nelson, author and political writer, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/08/president-oprah-2020-216257\">Politico</a> in their survey.</p>\n<p>“As compelling as her speech was … it isn’t clear she has the interest, energy, or commitment to run for the nation’s highest office,” Douglas Schoen, a pollster and former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in the same survey.</p>\n<p>Also unclear: any of Winfrey’s political stances. It is safe to assume she is progressive, but her positions on specific policies are not widely known. As <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/yw5n8x/i-cant-believe-i-have-to-explain-why-oprah-shouldnt-be-president\">Peyser</a> points out, she seems to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacobkornbluh/status/950411758820364290\">pro-Israel</a>, appears Obama-esque in her take on the American dream, and, of course, has been an important force in philanthropy — for example, donating $10 million to Hurricane Katrina relief efforts and founding a <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/oprah-winfrey-leadership-academy-for-girls-10-year-anniversary-1202510605/\">school for girls</a> in Africa. But we don’t know precisely what she thinks about issues such as health care, foreign policy, or taxes. </p>\n<p>Winfrey supported Obama over Clinton in 2008 and somewhat <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/oprah-winfrey-on-clinton-230148\">tepidly backed</a> Clinton in 2016. According to data from the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=oprah+winfrey&order=desc&sort=D\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, she hasn’t been an overly eager political donor, either. She has made donations to Obama, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and a handful of Democratic entities in the past, but she doesn’t appear to have made a political contribution since 2013. </p>\n<p>Whether Oprah will ultimately make a run for the White House remains to be seen — but the idea seems at least as plausible now as a Donald Trump presidency did in summer 2015. </p>",

I have fought. I have clawed. I have <em>scraped</em>. And I have done it strategically, so I could arrive at this moment.”</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rose McGowan’s relentless fight against the Harvey Weinsteins of Hollywood, explained&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/19/16484728/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>After years of tumultuous treatment by the entertainment industry, McGowan was one of the first public names to come forward against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein when the allegations became public last October. (Though she initially thought she had signed a nondisclosure agreement barring her from speaking out in specifics, McGowan told the TCA press that she was, much to her own frustration and shock, misinformed.) Though McGowan <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/19/16484728/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein\">had already become one of the more unfiltered voices </a>in Hollywood by that time, the bombshell report lent her an elevated platform, which she is now using in order to produce <em>Citizen Rose</em> “on a global scale.”</p>\n<p>But McGowan’s place in the burgeoning movement to expel sexual harassers and abusers from their respective industries has not been without complications. Before the Golden Globes, McGowan <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42409914\">railed hard against Meryl Streep</a> and the widespread planned action of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/6/16855888/golden-globes-2018-black-dress-protest-metoo\">wearing black in protest</a>, insisting in a since-deleted tweet that “YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly &amp; affect no real change.” (Streep has denied any knowledge of Weinstein’s alleged crimes.)</p>\n<p>McGowan has also specifically derided the Time’s Up initiative — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">the newly announced coalition</a> of hundreds of Hollywood actresses and various women’s advocacy groups to fight sexual abuse across industries — as a fallacy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/950174820498522112\">calling</a> those wearing black at the Globes “fancy people wearing black to honor our rapes.” Later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/950602049904828416\">she pointed out</a> that Time’s Up meetings have been scheduled to take place within CAA, one of the talent agencies that she has often slammed as being an intrinsic part of Hollywood’s systemic problems. </p>\n<p>So it’s not surprising that when I asked McGowan if she thought there was any way for something like Time’s Up to effect change from within the broken systems it’s trying to transform, I barely got my question out before she responded with an unequivocal, “No.”</p>\n<p>“I know the people that are behind [the system],” she said. “I know where they have their meetings. I know who’s sponsoring them. I know a lot of things. And people actually think I make pronouncements and proclamations like I live in Enid, Oklahoma, or something ... [but] I know these people. I’ve known them for a really long time.”</p>\n<p>As for the Golden Globes protest — which McGowan did not see, as she insisted that red carpets “aren’t my thing” — she didn’t hold back. “People see on the outside, they see the red carpet. I see behind the scenes. So I know a lot of things. I think the system is massively broken. That’s a Band-Aid to make yourself feel better about what you’ve all known about, and been silent witnesses to and/or participants in that silence — and no, I do not forgive.”</p>\n<p>Citizen Rose <em>premieres Tuesday, January 30</em><em>,</em><em> at 8 pm EST</em><em> on E</em><em>.</em></p>",

Dick Durbin (D-Ill) has been on the front lines of Congress’s immigration debate for more than a decade, but after he left a meeting with President Donald Trump on the issue Tuesday, he said his “head is spinning.”</p>\n<p>Legislators convened in the White House to see if they could make any headway on a legislative fix for the now-sunsetting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — what many Democrats say is a prerequisite for averting a government shutdown on January 19. The meeting, by all accounts, was a doozy. </p>\n<p>In the extended bipartisan meeting, which was televised and mostly open to the press, Trump appeared to agree to almost everything presented to him — even if it came from Democrats. </p>\n<p>He said he would “like” to pass a “clean” DACA bill, that would restore protections for upwards of 700,000 undocumented immigrants against deportation, and would “take the heat” politically for comprehensive immigration reform. In the past, that’s meant policy with a path to citizenship — a stark break the views espoused by his immigration hardliner advisers and supporters.</p>\n<p>“We are going to do DACA, and then we then we can start immediately on the Phase 2 which would be comprehensive immigration — I would like that,” Trump said. “I think a lot of people would like to do DACA first.”</p>\n<p>At one point in the meeting,<strong> </strong>Trump seemed so amenable to Democratic demands that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) had to jump in and remind Trump of the Republican position on DACA: that any agreement needs to come with substantial border security. </p>\n<p>Republican senators returned to the Capitol Building saying the conversation with Trump “narrowed” negotiations to four factors: the legal status of DACA recipients, border security, family-based immigration, and the visa lottery system. </p>\n<p>But that doesn’t seem be any advancement from where negotiations were yesterday or last week. If Congress wants to pass a DACA deal by the end of January, they are going to have to start making the difficult decisions soon. </p>\n<p>Trump isn’t one for making those difficult decisions — and Congress isn’t any closer to a deal.</p>\n<h3>Trump doesn’t appear to have a clear vision on immigration</h3>\n<p>For weeks, Republicans have been asking the White House for more clarity on what Trump’s vision for a DACA deal.</p>\n<p>But clarity was hard to come by on Tuesday. Trump said that he supported both expansive immigration — telling Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), “If you want to take it that further step, I’ll take the heat. You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform”— and told Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that he’d like to see a clean DACA bill first, with comprehensive immigration reform later.</p>\n<p>His definition of a “clean DACA bill” is a little difficult to parse. </p>\n<p>“I think a clean DACA bill, to me, is a DACA bill, but we take care of the 800,000 people ... but I think, to me, a clean bill is a bill of DACA, we take care of them, and we also take care of security,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>There are currently <em>five</em> <em>different proposals</em> to enshrine DACA into law, all of which could fit into Trump’s “DACA bill” specification — from the DREAM Act, which Democrats and some Republicans would like to see passed, to the more conservative Succeed Act, which extends the citizenship process and addresses family-based immigration. Depending on whom you talk to, border security could mean anything from funding drones and more boots on the ground to the 30-foot concrete border wall that Trump so famously coined on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>Durbin told reporters that Trump described the “wall” in many different ways during the meeting, leaving some in the room confused about what he was actually envisioning. Republicans seemed to come away with varying degrees of specifics.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a 2000-mile physical wall,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) recounted of Trump’s explanation. “We’ve been begging him to say this kind of stuff before. It’s about 700 or 800 miles total. Some of that is a replacement. But more important, the wall is really a fence. That was really important, a wall system.”</p>\n<p>Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) said “what was very clear today is border security is not a wall. That is an element of multiple elements that are going to be in there.”</p>\n<p>Lankford went on to say: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The president today has backed off of any kind of description that he’s looking for a sea-to-shining-sea fence, or wall. He backed up and said, That is not what we’re trying to do. We’re going to do technology in some areas. That’s one of the things Democrats have pushed very hard on to say technology will lead, not wall in some areas. He consented to that today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Asked if this meeting offered the clarity Republicans have been looking for Lankford said, “Oh no, there’s still room to go.”</p>\n<h3>Conservatives are probably not happy with whatever just happened</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most critical moment of the meeting was when Feinstein asked Trump if he would sign on to a “clean DACA” bill now with the assurance of more comprehensive immigration reform to come. Trump, agreeable, seemingly acquiesced to the Democratic agenda:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TRUMP</strong>: I have no problem — I think that’s basically what Dick [Durbin] is saying. We’re going to come out with DACA. We will do DACA and then we can start immediately on Phase 2. which would be comprehensive.</p>\n<p><strong>FEINSTEIN</strong>: Would you be agreeable to that?</p>\n<p><strong>TRUMP</strong>: Yeah, I would like to do that. I think a lot of people would like to see that. But I think we have to do DACA first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s not what Republicans have been calling for.</p>\n<p>McCarthy jumped in. The president had seemingly forgotten everything the Republican Party had established in the negotiations thus far: DACA had to come with some border security:</p>\n<p>“Mr. President, you need to be clear though. I think what Senator Feinstein’s asking here — when we talk about just DACA, we don’t want to be back here two years later,” McCarthy said. “You have to have security, as the secretary would tell you.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s what she’s saying,” Trump retorted.</p>\n<p>Republicans in the room erupted in a chorus of “No! No! No!”</p>\n<p>“No, I think she is saying something different,” McCarthy said. Trump quickly returned to his talking points: chain migration, a merit-based immigration system, and border security. </p>\n<p>But Trump’s willingness to accept Democrats’ terms was not lost on those outside the room. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) who chairs the conservative Freedom Caucus immediately <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexNBCNews/status/950792846721810434\">told reporters</a> a two-step immigration deal, with a clean DACA bill and comprehensive reform later would be a non-starter. </p>\n<p>Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-KY) former top adviser was more candid:</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What in the hell am I watching right now.</p>— Doug Stafford (@dougstafford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dougstafford/status/950799964174798849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<h3>The meeting seemed to make some pundits think something was happening. </h3>\n<p>Trump ended the meeting with a nod to the reporters in the room: “I hope we gave you enough material. This should cover you for about two weeks,” he said.</p>\n<p>The punditry that followed was almost as confusing as the meeting itself. Despite having just witnessed an inconclusive and at times contradictory session of policy negotiations, many in the media were quick to praise Trump for televising the vast majority of the meeting.</p>\n<p>CNN’s Dana Bash went so far to call Trump’s showing “the presidency that many people thought Donald Trump was capable of.” Fox News’s Martha MacCallum called the discussion thoughtful and “policy proficient.”</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dana Bash Praises Trump Over Immigration Meeting: 'This Is the Presidency Many' Thought He Was Capable Of (VIDEO) <a href=\"https://t.co/f3BUzGw0U7\">https://t.co/f3BUzGw0U7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GkXUYznsNh\">pic.twitter.com/GkXUYznsNh</a></p>— Mediaite (@Mediaite) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mediaite/status/950815983576416257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Those in Trump’s inner circle were quick to amplify the positive reviews. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@POTUS</a> takes extraordinary step in leading a bipartisan, bicameral policy discussion with the cameras rolling the entire time.

Nancy Pelosi (CA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (NY), last fall, except this time it seems little, if anything, was actually accomplished.</p>\n<h3>Actual legislating doesn’t happen in televised meetings</h3>\n<p>Lawmakers didn’t expect to come out this meeting with a “deal.”</p>\n<p>For one, the meeting included almost every ideological slice of the Democratic and Republican parties, from immigration hardliners like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) to Congressional Hispanic Caucus leader Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), who notably was not invited, but successfully showed up anyway. And it was mostly televised. </p>\n<p>That’s not how agreements are reached in Congress. </p>\n<p>Instead, Republicans came out of the White House with a unified message: The conversation with Trump “narrowed the scope” of the conversation to protections for DACA recipients, family-based immigration, border security, and the visa lottery system.</p>\n<p>To be clear, that is not narrow at all. The takeaway here is actually much simpler: Looking to Trump isn’t going to get Republicans any closer to a deal on DACA. That’s a negotiation that has to happen among themselves.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16841954/daca-immigration-deal-trump-congress\">Vox’s Dara Lind explained</a>, if Republicans want a deal, the path forward is pretty straightforward:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If they decide they want to get to yes on a DACA deal, the policy can fall into place pretty easily — thanks to the ongoing bipartisan Senate negotiations, and the fact that, frankly, it’s pretty easy to imagine a compromise both sides would be happy with. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Congressional leaders are expected to meet again Wednesday to talk more specifics. If Democrats are intent on getting this done by the government spending deadline — which Republicans continue to be reluctant to do — they need to start making some decisions.</p>\n<p><em>Dylan Scott contributed reporting to this story.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

Even hard-nosed political observers, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fpolicy-and-politics%2F2018%2F1%2F8%2F16862592%2Foprah-golden-globes-president\">Nate Cohn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/950512556485103616/\">Nate Silver</a>, pointed out she would be a real contender. </p>\n<p>Oprah has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/oprah-denies-presidential-ambition-after-new-day-globes-speech\">denied any interest in the White House</a>, but that hasn’t stopped people from wondering what an Oprah presidency could look like — and what scrutiny she’d face if she really harbors political ambitions. </p>\n<p>Since people are clamoring for her to run as a solution to our country’s problems, we wanted to highlight one area in which the broadcaster, billionaire, and philanthropist has a pretty dubious record: science.</p>\n<p>During her 25-year reign as host of <em>The </em><em>Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, from 1986 to 2011, Oprah repeatedly showed a weakness for crackpots and quack medical theories. One could even argue that she’s one of the most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/4/13/8385295/science-reporting-ethics\">powerful enablers</a> of cranks on the planet. Here’s a quick rundown of some of her worst assaults on reason and scientific thinking. </p>\n<h3>Oprah made Dr. Oz a celebrity</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"86th Annual Hollywood Christmas Parade - Arrivals\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESr5Y11osqbjBbD6OuhdzTe0up8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10003503/879898524.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>David Livingston/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Oprah helped popularize Dr. Oz, a notorious woo peddler.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In 2004, Dr. Oz made his first appearance on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show, </em>where he was referred to as “America’s Doctor” (a moniker he trademarked). As a regular medical expert on Oprah, he used the platform to back a range of questionable health practices, including lending credibility to the Brazilian spirit medium and well-known huckster <a href=\"http://web.randi.org/home/from-the-archives-randis-inside-scoop-into-abc-news-john-of-god-investigation-2005\">”John of God.”</a></p>\n<p>The Oprah seal of approval helped Oz get his own show by 2009. Her instincts about his potential were good, in a sense: Oz is immensely popular, and his media empire now extends to books, magazines, radio, websites, and, of course, TV. But on <em>The Dr. Oz Show</em>, the cardiothoracic surgeon <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8412427/dr-oz-health-claims\">has regularly</a> promoted bad science and bogus health advice. </p>\n<p>In 2014, Oz was called before a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5838690/why-is-dr-oz-still-a-doctor\">Senate subcommittee</a> on consumer protection. He was asked by the senator in charge, Claire McCaskill, to explain his use of “flowery” language to champion weight loss fixes that don’t actually work. She then admonished him for endorsing a rainbow of supplements as potential <a href=\"http://www.doctoroz.com/article/7-belly-blasters-really-work\">“belly blasters” </a>and <a href=\"http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/mega-metabolism-boosters\">“mega metabolism boosters.”</a> As McCaskill put it, “The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of the three products you called ‘miracles.’”</p>\n<p>In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/1/27/7920779/dr-oz-ftc-complaint\">Federal Trade Commission found</a> that Oz’s producers did the scantest research on the show’s guests, which allowed modern-day snake oil salesmen to appear on air hawking bogus products. That same year, a group of professors, scientists, and doctors <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8423867/dr-oz-letter-columbia\">argued</a> that the show was so misleading that Oz’s professor position was incompatible with his on-air work.</p>\n<p>Oz has also shared the stage with <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml\">vaccine deniers</a>, and activists like <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/7/8360935/food-babe\">“Food Babe” Vani Hari</a> (known to scientists as “the Jenny McCarthy of food”). At the height of the<a href=\"http://www.today.com/video/today/56161840\"> Ebola panic</a> last year, Oz suggested the virus could go airborne — even though there was universal agreement among virologists that the pathogens have never behaved that way.</p>\n<p>All this didn’t turn Oprah off of Oz. He remains a regular contributor to her <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/fashion_and_beauty/behind-the-scenes-of-o-magazines-january-2018-cover-shoot_1/all\">widely read O magazine</a> and her website, and <a href=\"http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/oz-exclusive-hour-oprah\">she still appears on his show</a>. </p>\n<h3>Oprah created “Dr.” Phil</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Today - Season 66\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROjG0I51TlykfyUZlAJrqDcWmng=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10003497/867165264.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Nathan Congleton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Dr. Phil has reportedly exploited vulnerable guests on his show. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Despite his medical shenanigans, Dr. Oz has an actual medical degree to his name. Dr. Phil, on the other hand, doesn’t (he only holds a doctorate in psychology and is not a licensed psychologist). But that minor detail didn’t stop Oprah from using the doctor moniker to help brand Phil McGraw, too. </p>\n<p>McGraw also got his start on Oprah’s show, after meeting the TV star while working with her as a consultant when she was being (unsuccessfully) sued for making negative statements about the beef industry in 1995. By the late 1990s, Dr. Phil started appearing on her show as a life coach, and in 2002 he launched his own eponymous show. </p>\n<p>Like Dr. Oz, McGraw has been censured for using his celebrity and his show for ethically dubious practices. In 2016, he was criticized for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/26/11119788/dr-phil-diabetes\">peddling diabetes pharmaceuticals through paid sponsorships</a> that were masquerading as friendly advice about a disease from a trusted source.</p>\n<p>And last December, a <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/12/28/dr-phil-addiction/\">Stat</a> investigation uncovered some unethical behind-the-scenes practices on the show, including giving vodka to a guest who was battling alcoholism and asking other guests with severe drug addictions to buy drugs on the street — all for the purposes of entertainment. </p>\n<p>“It’s a callous and inexcusable exploitation,” <a href=\"http://profiles.sc-ctsi.org/jeffrey.sugar\">Dr. Jeff Sugar</a>, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Southern California, told Stat. “These people are barely hanging on. It’s like if one of them was drowning and approaching a lifeboat, and instead of throwing them an inflatable doughnut, you throw them an anchor.”</p>\n<p>Like Dr. Oz, McGraw is still a regular contributor to O magazine, and the <em>Dr. Phil</em> show still airs on the <a href=\"https://www.drphil.com/show-pages/drphilown/\">Oprah Winfrey Network</a>. </p>\n<h3>Oprah gave Jenny McCarthy a platform to spread hogwash about vaccines</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"ABC's Coverage of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2018\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JzW5MXAohmJ3a8XZfkralJ9SAdQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10003489/900204302.jpg.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Jenny McCarthy authored an anti-vaccine book with the discredited British doctor Andrew Wakefield. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Actress, Playboy model, and pseudoscience peddler Jenny McCarthy has been an ardent anti-vaccine advocate. She helped propel the discredited British doctor <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9342825/donald-trump-vaccines-autism\">Andrew Wakefield</a>, who has argued that vaccines cause autism based on his own fraudulent research, to fame. (McCarthy even co-authored an anti-vax book in 2011 with Wakefield, titled<em> </em><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.ca%2FCallous-Disregard-Autisms-Vaccines-Tragedy%2Fdp%2F1616083239%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1359663830%26sr%3D8-1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Callous Disregard</em></a>.) In the media, she’s claimed that vaccines gave her son Evan autism, and that she was able to “cure” him through a special diet and supplements. </p>\n<p>Of course, the notion that vaccines cause autism <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/5/11/15508006/what-causes-autism-spectrum-disorder-vaccine-theory\">has never been supported by science</a>. But Oprah gave McCarthy a vast audience via her TV show in 2007.<strong> </strong>Science <a href=\"http://blogs.plos.org/thepanicvirus/2013/07/15/a-jenny-mccarthy-reader-pt-2-jenny-brings-her-anti-vaccine-views-to-oprah/\">journalist Seth Mnookin</a>, who covered this meeting of the minds in his book <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPanic-Virus-Behind-Vaccine-Autism-Controversy%2Fdp%2F1439158657\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Panic Virus</em></a>, reported that Winfrey “praised McCarthy’s unwillingness to bow to authority, her faith in herself, and her use of the Internet as a tool for bypassing society’s traditional gatekeepers.” Here’s an excerpt from the interview transcript: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MCCARTHY: First thing I did — Google. I put in autism. And I started my research.</p>\n<p>WINFREY: Thank God for Google.</p>\n<p>MCCARTHY: I’m telling you. </p>\n<p>WINFREY: Thank God for Google.</p>\n<p>MCCARTHY: The University of Google is where I got my degree from. ... And I put in autism and something came up that changed my life, that led me on this road to recovery, which said autism — it was in the corner of the screen — is reversible and treatable. And I said, What?! That has to be an ad for a hocus-pocus thing, because if autism is reversible and treatable, well, then it would be on Oprah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Days after that Oprah appearance, McCarthy was invited on <em>Larry King Live </em>and<em> Good Morning America </em>to spread her anti-vaccine message even further. Between the three shows, she reached between 15 million and 20 million viewers with her anti-vaccine message, Mnookin estimated. </p>\n<p>To this day, the episode featuring McCarthy, <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/mothers-battle-autism/1\">“Mothers Battle Autism,”</a> is featured on Oprah’s website, without any correction or acknowledgment of the problems with McCarthy’s claims. </p>\n<p>For more about Oprah’s relationship with junk science, read David Gorski’s <a href=\"https://respectfulinsolence.com/2018/01/09/oprah-winfrey-president-anyone-remember-pseudoscience-quackery-shes-promoted/\">great rundown</a> on his blog Respectful Insolence.

That’s the key takeaway from <a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf\">Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson’s extensive testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee</a>, released Tuesday by ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) over the objections of her Republican colleagues.</p>\n<p>Simpson’s hearing lasted for hours, and the transcript is extremely long and mostly fairly tedious. But Simpson does clearly state that when Steele spoke to the FBI about his findings, the bureau “believed Chris’s information might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization.”</p>\n<p>That sounds like Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/30/16833954/george-papadopoulos-trump-times\">according to a recent report in the New York Times</a>, accidentally kicked off the Trump-Russia investigation by telling Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russia had political dirt on Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, after a night of heavy drinking in May 2016. </p>\n<p>Conservatives have recently been pushing a theory that the basis for the FBI investigation was an opposition research document compiled at the behest of Clinton’s campaign. Simpson’s testimony seems to confirm the Times account and thereby debunk a conservative counternarrative that places the dossier itself at the center of the story.</p>\n<h3>Wait, who are these people?</h3>\n<p>Glenn Simpson is one of the co-founders of Fusion GPS, a “strategic intelligence” firm that was hired first by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news publication, and later by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to conduct opposition research on Donald Trump. Fusion, in turn, contracted with former MI-6 Russia specialist Christopher Steele to look specifically at Trump and Russia. </p>\n<p>Steele’s investigation ended with a number of allegations, including that Trump is possibly being blackmailed by Russian security services with a recording of him paying prostitutes to pee on a bed at a luxury hotel at Moscow, and also that Trump’s campaign was the beneficiary of a multifaceted Kremlin plot to interfere in the 2016 US election. </p>\n<p>BuzzFeed published Steele’s dossier in January 2017, setting off a firestorm of controversy and intriguing many liberals. But in recent months, the dossier has taken on new life as the centerpiece of a conservative counter-conspiracy theory, which holds that the whole Trump-Russia investigation was cooked up by the president’s political enemies. Simpson’s testimony is significant in the present context primarily for debunking that narrative. </p>\n<h3>The dossier is now the centerpiece of a conservative counternarrative</h3>\n<p>On January 3, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) — a key House conservative — rolled out a tweetstorm asking 18 questions about the FBI and Russia, many of them centering on the dossier.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1) Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, author of the dossier?</p>— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/948567147155947520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Jordan, joined by another leading House conservative, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-SC), is also <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/reps-mark-meadows-and-jim-jordan-its-time-for-jeff-sessions-to-go-as-shown-by-the-latest-fbi-leak/article/2644934\">calling for Trump to fire Jeff Sessions</a> so he can put a new attorney general in place who would oversee (and presumably quash) the Russia investigation. This is part of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/5/16737350/mueller-russia-scandal-peter-strzok-trump\">broader conservative effort to discredit the Mueller investigation</a>, which in turn is part of a broader <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/19/16503026/trump-tweets-russia-uranium-dossier\">conservative counternarrative on the whole Russia scandal</a>. </p>\n<p>And the dossier plays a key role in this conspiracy theory. </p>\n<p>Because conservatives are “just asking questions” about the FBI and Steele, they tend not to explicitly state what they think happened. But in broad strokes, the theory is something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trump’s political enemies paid Fusion GPS to write a dossier full of debunked claims about his connections to Russia.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/22/14598834/trump-deep-state\">“Deep state”</a> anti-Trump elements in the FBI used this false opposition research document to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant targeting <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/1/16724232/flynn-testify-against-trump\">Michael Flynn</a>.</li>\n<li>The Flynn surveillance, which never should have been allowed because it was based on the phony dossier, was used to catch him in a lie about a meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that was completely innocuous. </li>\n<li>This got Flynn fired and, by making meetings with Kislyak into a hot-button issue, also forced Sessions into recusing himself, which in turn gave Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (whom Trump has decided is <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365406-trump-privately-calling-rosenstein-a-threat-to-his-presidency-report\">“a Democrat,”</a> though it’s not clear why) the opportunity to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel. </li>\n<li>Mueller, in turn, is buddies with former FBI Director James Comey, who is bitter about having been fired by Trump (Comey under this theory is a bad guy because he went too easy on Hillary Clinton over the email server, and we’re not supposed to pay attention to the fact that Trump’s stated reason for firing him was that he was <em>too</em> <em>hard</em> on Clinton) and is therefore leading an anti-Trump witch hunt. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, of course, other penumbras and emanations around the conservative account of the Steele dossier. Former Rep. Jason Chaffetz was on Fox recently, for example, arguing that it’s <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/03/following-bombshell-report-fox-news-desperately-clinging-their-alternate-reality-about-russia/218961\">against the law to hire a foreign national</a> to do work for a campaign (this is not true) and therefore the existence of the dossier is just another example of Crooked Hillary’s lawbreaking. </p>\n<p>The reality, however, is that while Steele is well-regarded in intelligence circles, there is no indication that his work has ever been the basis of the FBI’s Russia investigation.</p>\n<h3>Papadopoulos was the start of the investigation</h3>\n<p>A New York Times report earlier this month indicated that the investigation began not with Steele’s dossier but with Papadopoulos’s drunken conversation with Downer, Australia’s ambassador to the UK and a former Australian foreign minister. </p>\n<p>Simpson’s testimony appears to independently corroborate what the New York Times already reported — the FBI listened to Steele because they already had an investigation into this question underway, an investigation that was launched because Papadopoulos’s conversation with Downer was shared with other Australian officials, who ultimately passed word of it to their American counterparts once the hacking of Democratic email accounts became a big deal.</p>\n<p>As best as we can tell, this, rather than Steele’s memo, was the start of the investigation.</p>\n<p>And while the investigation has not yet proven the existence of anything like the vast conspiracy that Steele alleges, it certainly has uncovered real evidence of wrongdoing — including a guilty plea from Papadopoulos himself, and serious charges against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. </p>\n<p>We’ve also learned from the investigation that key Trumpworld figures, including Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr., were, at a minimum, eager to potentially collaborate with the Russian government on revealing anti-Clinton “dirt,” rather than emulating Downer in alerting the authorities to the existence of an active Russian intelligence effort aimed at the United States.</p>\n<p>It also, obviously, continues to be an ongoing investigation that might yet reveal other criminal activity. Or it might not. But either way, Simpson’s testimony — which Republicans on the committee didn’t want released to the public — is more evidence that the question was taken seriously by law enforcement for reasons that had nothing to do with Steele or his dossier.</p>",

One of his very last campaign ads was a YouTube video that, in conspiracy theory-tinged <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/presidential-election/2016/11/5/13534192/trump-ad-new-world-order-conspiracy-theory-neo-nazis\">language</a>, blasted “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class.”</p>\n<p>But on Tuesday, the White House announced that President Donald Trump will be attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, later this month.</p>\n<p>Davos is the signature gathering of the global elite, an event synonymous with the dream of a borderless, free-trading, fully integrated world — the exact kind of globalism that Trump claims to oppose. Davos is so synonymous with the international power structure that former White House Senior strategist Steve Bannon used the conference as a byword for his enemies. </p>\n<p>“The working men and women in the world,” <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-steve-bannon-sees-the-entire-world?utm_term=.uhAYQ83Nn#.cq0NMZKX4\">Bannon said</a> in a speech, “[are] just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos.”</p>\n<p>That “party” now seems to count President Trump as one of its members.</p>\n<h3>This is a betrayal of Trumpism as an ideology</h3>\n<p>Though Davos is a major conference of global muckety-mucks, the kind of place where you can find the former leaders of major countries just lounging at the hotel bar, American presidents typically don’t attend. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama skipped the conference entirely; Bill Clinton is the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-12232883\">only US president</a> ever to attend while in office.</p>\n<p>Trump’s attendance, then, is not just some pro-forma appearance he’s required to attend. It is actually a break with precedent, meaning there’s some reason that Trump is choosing to act like, to borrow the language of his alt-right fans, a “globalist <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9276719/nrorevolt-cuckservatives\">cuck</a>.”</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that Trump is in the midst of a very public falling out with Bannon, who’s quoted accusing Donald Trump Jr. of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff\">“treasonous”</a> behavior in the new book <em>Fire and Fury</em>. It’s possible that this is intended, at least in part, as a slap in Bannon’s face given his well-documented hatred of the conference.</p>\n<div><aside><q>Trump is not the ideologue he sometimes seems to be</q></aside></div>\n<p>It’s also possible that some of Trump’s more mainstream advisers, like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn, see Trump attending Davos as a way of calming fears about his presidency. US allies are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/9/19/16334910/trump-united-nations-north-korea-iran-unga\">deeply concerned</a> by Trump’s vocal hostility to immigration, his attacks on free trade, his criticism of US alliances as one-sided, and his support for <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/21/trump-supports-marine-le-pen-237464\">European far-right parties</a>. Bringing him to Davos, an event that symbolizes the exact opposite of all that, could be a way of trying to calm down jittery partners.</p>\n<p>And in some ways, Trump really belongs at Davos. He is a self-described billionaire, born rich, who has properties and investments all over the world. He sells himself as a champion of the neglected American working class, and there’s little evidence that he actually disgusts globetrotting elites in the same visceral way that Bannon and his followers seem to. You could see this less as Trump betraying his own rhetoric and more as a reversion to form.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the clearest takeaway from this decision is that Trump is not the ideologue he sometimes seems to be.</p>",

Clinton <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-12232883\">became the first sitting US president</a> to appear at Davos in 2000. Presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama never attended the summit. President Ronald Reagan did, but via video link.</p>\n<p>Trump and those around him largely shunned Davos in 2017. A senior member of Trump’s transition team told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/trump-team-shunning-davos-gathering-of-world-s-economic-elite\">Bloomberg</a> at the time that Trump thought sending an official representative or attending the event himself would betray his populist movement, and that the gathering represented the “power structure that fueled the populist anger” that propelled him to the White House in the first place.</p>\n<h3>This time last year, Trump was singing a very different tune</h3>\n<p>The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting at Davos is one of the most elite gatherings in the world. Held in the Swiss Alps, it has come to symbolize modern globalization and exclusivity at its peak. Last year, although Trump didn’t attend, he was a looming presence, according to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/davos-trump-china-2017-1\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/donald-trumps-inauguration-what-they-had-to-say-at-davos/\">reports</a>. </p>\n<p>At Davos in 2017, Alibaba’s Jack Ma <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/donald-trumps-inauguration-what-they-had-to-say-at-davos/\">openly worried</a> about a potential US-China trade war and said he believed observers should give then-President-elect Trump “some time.” </p>\n<p>Former Secretary of State John Kerry said he hoped Trump wouldn’t reverse his achievements. “Take Iran: I bet you that our friends and allies will get together and that Russia, China, Germany, France, and Britain will say, you know what, this is a good deal, we’re going to keep it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman<strong> </strong>acknowledged that the election “didn’t go the way I wanted” but said she hoped to give Trump “the benefit of the doubt.” Actor Forest Whitaker was similarly cautiously optimistic in a talk there. “I hope he’ll be a president who, in the end, represents all people,” he said. </p>\n<p>Igor Shuvalov, first deputy prime minister of Russia, weighed in on what was then the impending Trump presidency as well: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Trump is a leading businessman; you can’t survive in business if you’re not dying for victory. He’ll have to get results; it’s part of his personality. I hope Trump — a superb professional entrepreneur — will become a professional president and achieve results for global security. I hope he’ll agree with Putin on how to solve Ukraine. But for results, you need to negotiate with Russia and not put Russia in a corner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Trump and his team largely stayed away.<strong> </strong>Gary Cohn, now director of the National Economic Council under Trump, skipped the 2017 gathering after being a regular attendee in the past, and other Trump appointees opted out as well.</p>\n<p>The exception was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/24/16011188/who-is-anthony-scaramucci-communications-director\">Anthony Scaramucci</a>, who would go on to serve a 10-day stint as White House communications director the following summer. The former hedge funder said he found himself <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-17/the-trump-curiosity-gap-makes-scaramucci-an-unlikely-davos-draw\">“jammed up”</a> with meeting requests at the summit and appeared on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-represents-last-great-hope-for-globalism-adviser-anthony-scaramucci-says-in-davos-1484671450\">several panels</a>, billing himself as a sort of Trump whisperer, close to the incoming president’s ear.</p>\n<p>“If you guys get a little bit upset about the tweeting or some of the things that he’s saying, I want to put your mind at ease,” Scaramucci said during last year’s event, according to a report from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-represents-last-great-hope-for-globalism-adviser-anthony-scaramucci-says-in-davos-1484671450\">the Wall Street Journal</a>. “Directionally, this is a super-compassionate man.”</p>\n<p>What a difference a year makes — and then it doesn’t. Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/6/16857492/trump-tweets-mental-health\">off-the-wall tweeting</a> continues. But this time around, instead of Scaramucci making excuses for him, the president will be at Davos to speak for himself. </p>",

But in 2018, Arpaio is back and running for US Senate — hoping that his close association with Trump, and a newly wiped-clean criminal record, are going to help him Make Arizona Great Again.</p>\n<p>Arpaio told the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-arpaio-running-for-senate-in-arizona/article/2645354\">Washington Examiner’s David Drucker</a> on Tuesday that he’s running for the seat currently held by Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who’s retiring. Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) is considered the favorite in the GOP primary for Flake’s seat. Meanwhile, conservative challenger Kelli Ward is also looking likely to get in the race. Arpaio could displace Ward as the first choice of the Trumpist wing of the party, and his name recognition, especially among fans of the president, is likely to be extremely high.</p>\n<p>Arpaio has Trump to thank for his political second act: In August last year, the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/8/25/16207446/trump-arpaio-pardon\">pardoned Arpaio</a> for contempt of court (a charge he was federally convicted of for continuing to engage in aggressive immigration enforcement in defiance of a 2011 court order) before he’d even been sentenced. </p>\n<p>Arpaio is still fighting civil suits over his immigration policy, but in the meantime he’s taken the step of formally declaring his candidacy for Senate. </p>\n<p>The sheriff’s close relationship with Trump is key to his insurgent cred. In Flake’s announcement of his retirement, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/24/16536756/flake-retitrement-over-trump-announcement\">he called Trump “dangerous to democracy”</a>; it’s a sentiment fellow Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has shared. </p>\n<p>Part of the reason the Arizona Senate race is becoming so crowded is that McCain is battling brain cancer — raising the possibility that he’ll vacate his seat and create a second opening, and race, in 2018. If that happens, Arpaio might find himself with an opening to become the front-runner in a race to replace his long-time political enemy McCain.</p>\n<p>Joe Arpaio helped create the Donald Trump who won the presidency. In 2018, he’s promising — or threatening? — to help bring Trumpism to the Senate.</p>\n<h3>Arpaio was convicted of violating a judge’s order for actions the Trump administration wants every sheriff to emulate</h3>\n<p>In the mid- to late-2000s, the federal government began to ramp up immigration enforcement to an unprecedented degree — by relying on cooperation with local law enforcement. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio was the face of local enforcement of federal immigration law.</p>\n<p>He called himself “America’s Toughest Sheriff.” He gave celebrity tours of his famous “tent cities” for housing unauthorized immigrants and gifted guests with commemorative pairs of the pink underwear he made inmates wear. He bragged about the results of his “sweeps” — local immigration raids to round up unauthorized immigrants and hand them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>Those sweeps, in particular, raised questions about how exactly Arpaio and his deputies were determining who to apprehend for immigration offenses — in other words, whether they were just racially profiling Latino residents of Maricopa County. In 2007, he was <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/ortega-melendres-et-al-v-arpaio-et-al\">sued for civil-rights violations </a>by a few Latino residents who were stopped by deputies (and sometimes detained for hours) on suspicion of being in the US without papers, apparently because of their ethnicity.</p>\n<p>In 2011, shortly after President Barack Obama’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2011/12/15/mcso_findletter_12-15-11.pdf\">Justice Department released a report</a> finding that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office engaged in systematic racial profiling of Latinos, the judge in the racial profiling lawsuit issued an injunction preventing Arpaio from apprehending or detaining anyone purely on the basis of being a suspected unauthorized immigrant or turning such people over to federal agents.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Arpaio officially lost the civil suit. But by that point, it had become clear that his department hadn’t actually been complying with Judge Murray Snow’s 2011 injunction. They’d continued to engage in immigration “sweeps,” turn people over to ICE (or, when ICE stopped accepting detainees from Arpaio’s deputies, Border Patrol), and hold suspected immigrants in jail after they’d otherwise be released for federal agents to pick them up.</p>\n<p>After a series of hearings about the Maricopa Sheriff’s Office’s failure to comply with the 2011 order, Judge Snow cited Arpaio and a handful of his subordinates for civil contempt of court in 2015. Then, in 2016, he asked the US Attorney’s Office to charge Arpaio and three others with criminal contempt — which someone can only be convicted of if it’s shown they were willfully refusing to obey the court order, not just failing to make sure it was obeyed. </p>\n<p>Arpaio claimed that he wasn’t deliberately disobeying Judge Snow’s order, he just hadn’t understood it properly — and besides, any violations were the fault of his underlings. Judge Snow didn’t buy it. </p>\n<p>For one thing, witnesses testified that Arpaio and underlings had directed them not to change internal policies after the court order. <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/07/31/maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio-found-guilty-criminal-contempt-court/486278001/\">Arpaio himself,</a> during his frequent media appearances, often said that the department was just doing what it had always done. Arpaio also had attempted to dig up dirt on Judge Snow himself (including having a detective investigate Snow’s wife).</p>\n<p>By the time Arpaio was convicted in August 2017, however, there was a new sheriff in town — both in Maricopa County, where he’d been booted from office in 2016 (thanks in part to the county’s growing Latino electorate and in part to fatigue with Arpaio’s legal troubles) and in the United States, where Trump had been installed to take the same sort of tough-talking, disdainful-of-niceties, law-and-order approach to immigration around the country that Arpaio had taken in Maricopa County for all those years.</p>\n<h3>Arpaio understood, before Trump did, that law and order “toughness” doesn’t mean you actually have to conform to the laws</h3>\n<p>Sheriff Arpaio played a key role in validating Donald Trump, whose candidacy was initially seen as a joke, as the champion of hardline immigration policies and the cultural anxieties that came alongside them. </p>\n<p>Trump’s first truly major campaign rally, in August 2015, was in Phoenix with Arpaio and some of the “Angel Moms” (mothers of people killed by unauthorized immigrants) he would continue to co-opt as a candidate and president. Arpaio <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/26/arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio-endorses-trump/\">formally endorsed Trump in January 2016</a> — before a single primary vote had been cast. He took a gamble, and he won.</p>\n<p>So it makes sense that Trump, who has some apparent loyalty to people who supported him back when he was one of 17 Republican presidential candidates, would think warmly of Arpaio. But the endorsement isn’t really the basis of their simpatico. It’s just an acknowledgment of the political truth that Trump is engaging in exactly the same brand of politics that Arpaio pioneered a decade earlier. </p>\n<p>As politicians, they used tough-on-crime rhetoric and breaches of “political correctness” to give the impression of sticking up for law and order; as government executives, they exercised their power to the greatest possible extent, without a ton of attention paid to the rule of law.</p>\n<p>Like Trump, Arpaio communicated toughness through big, theatrical stunts — raids conducted with armored vehicles, the pink underwear, the tent cities — that often happened to violate the rights of their targets. (The tent cities were ultimately shut down after being cited as violations of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against “cruel and unusual punishment.”) </p>\n<p>His “law and order” policies weren’t successful as anti-crime measures (911 response times went up hugely during the heyday of Arpaio’s sweeps), but succeeded in terms of targeting and victimizing the intended people. </p>\n<p>In Arizona — a state with a fast-growing Latino population, but also a substantial population of older white residents who had often moved to Arizona from places that <em>hadn’t </em>had many Latinos — anxieties about demographic and cultural change were acute, and Arpaio capitalized on them. By the mid-2010s, those anxieties had percolated through much of the rest of the country as well, and Arpaianism was ready to go national — in the form of Trump.</p>\n<p>But when it came to the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office obeying the laws as well as enforcing them, Arpaio was, at best, uninterested. His internal-affairs office, as Judge Snow found, was more a task force to pursue grudges than an effort to root out misbehavior among deputies. </p>\n<p>He’s been cited for systematic abuses of power in trying to get his enemies brought up on criminal charges — including local judges, members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and the former <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101020184811/http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html\">mayor of Phoenix.</a> </p>\n<p>In other words, his August conviction for contempt of court didn’t come out of the blue. It was a predictable consequence of the way he’d run his department — guided by a philosophy that as long as law-enforcement officials were grabbing headlines by going after undesirable people, the public wouldn’t care so much about how it was done.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

The ultimate result was the 2013 sequester, which set into law across-the-board budget cuts and established caps that would amount to $1.2 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p>It’s important to remember that these sequester caps were never actually supposed to go into effect. They were designed to force a compromise. To win Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling, Obama agreed to push Congress to reduce the national debt, threatening cuts to domestic programs, which Democrats didn’t want, and to military spending, which Republicans didn’t want.</p>\n<p>Since the sequester, there have been two bipartisan deals to raise the caps by billions of dollars. The first in 2013 was forged between Paul<strong> </strong>Ryan and Patty Murray; a second was agreed upon in 2015. </p>\n<p>There’s no question that Trump wants Congress to do that again. His proposed defense budget busts the sequester cap by tens of billions. There’s just one problem: Congress needs 60 votes in the Senate. </p>\n<p>Congress now has until January 19 — less than two weeks — to find a way to avoid a government shutdown and a sequester. Democrats don’t often find themselves in a position to leverage their agenda, but the sequester caps open a path to get protections for the undocumented immigrants previously covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and permanent funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. </p>\n<p>Republicans really do need Democratic votes to raise the sequester caps and avoid a government shutdown, but so far, neither party seems ready to compromise.</p>\n<h3>A very brief history of how we got here</h3>\n<p>In early 2011, Republicans in the House, led by Speaker John Boehner, refused to increase the debt limit without Congress taking action to address the national debt. </p>\n<p>The face-off, which put the United States at risk of defaulting on its debt, pushed President Obama to sign the Budget Control Act. The law instructed Congress to find more than a trillion dollars in government spending cuts by the end of the year or risk a sequester, which cuts all discretionary programs — both defense and non-defense — across the board (except for entitlement programs like Medicaid and Social Security). </p>\n<p>Congress failed, triggering automatic budget cuts in 2013 and imposing annual, more restrictive budget caps until 2021. According to a 2015 report from the <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/sequestration-and-its-impact-on-non-defense-appropriations\">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, funding for domestic programs was essentially flat between 2012 and 2015, meaning there were substantial cuts when adjusted for inflation.</p>\n<p>Democrats and Republicans have repeatedly voted to raise the budget caps and give sequester relief, but those adjustments, which went through fiscal year 2017, have now expired.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the sequester budget caps max out defense spending at $549 billion and non-defense discretionary funding at $516 billion, far less than what Republicans and Democrats would like to spend.</p>\n<p>Last year, Trump’s budget called for $603 billion in defense funding, and both the Senate and House separately proposed even higher figures. </p>\n<p>The congressional process to fund the government — known as appropriations — runs on two tracks: 1) discretionary spending, which is split between defense funding for the military and non-defense funding, which covers areas like education, science, and government; and 2) mandatory spending, which most notably covers programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and welfare programs like cash assistance and food stamps.</p>\n<p>Appropriators need these topline numbers to begin putting together a trillion-dollar spending bill that would fund the government through next September. But there’s a lot more on the line. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"President Obama Delivers State Of The Union Address\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RMVo-T7Jf0FLjCpP4vOhbqk2DDA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10003595/461915746.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>In 2011, Obama signed a sequester law after a face-off with House Speaker John Boehner.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Republicans want a lot more military funding. Democrats want something big in return.</h3>\n<p>Democrats have established a guiding principle in spending negotiations: If Republicans want more funding for defense, then Democrats want a one-for-one increase in non-defense funding.</p>\n<p>But this year, that’s not all they want. Ever since Trump said he would put an end to DACA, which gives legal protections to undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, Democrats have said they’d use their leverage in spending negotiations to make sure the program is enshrined into law.</p>\n<p>So far, Congress has punted on government spending negotiations since October 1 of last year, the start of the 2018 fiscal year, passing short-term continuing resolution spending bills to keep the government open.</p>\n<p>This hasn’t been popular on either side of the aisle. The Democratic base has grown increasingly agitated about kicking DACA down the road, calling on their lawmakers to use the threat of government shutdown to win a legislative fix for DACA. Meanwhile, Republican defense hawks have been frustrated with the lack of permanent defense funding, warning that it hobbles the military’s ability to appropriately plan resources.</p>\n<p>“We must start doing our job again, pass budgets and go through the normal appropriations process, and provide our military with adequate, predictable funding,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) said at a hearing in early December.</p>\n<p>There’s already chatter about another CR to give Congress more time to strike a permanent 2018 spending bill, but Matthew Dennis, the Democratic spokesperson for the House Appropriations Committee told Vox it’s unlikely that would be able to pass without a deal on DACA and without raising the budget caps for 2018.</p>\n<p>Continuing the 2017 spending levels would actually break the 2018 sequester caps, meaning passing a CR without increasing the sequester caps would result in a $6 billion total cut from defense and non-defense spending.</p>\n<p>So far, the top four congressional leaders — Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — have now had several meetings to set topline budget numbers and establish a path forward for other key policy areas like immigration. McConnell left the most recent one “optimistic” that a deal could be struck, but had no firm details.</p>\n<p>Top Republicans have continued to push for keeping DACA out of spending negotiations. In a joint statement with the White House, they said it was “important that members of Congress do not hold funding for our troops hostage for immigration policy.” </p>\n<h3>This will be a game of chicken between Democrats and Republicans.</h3>\n<p>Since Congress returned to session in early January, negotiations over spending have been an inconclusive scramble.</p>\n<p>Democrats know they have some leverage. Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate to increase the budget caps and keep the government open, meaning they need to get at least nine Democrats on board.</p>\n<p>Having already secured some wins through the budget process in the past, coming <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/5/3/15524398/house-pass-spending-bill-gop-hates\">to an agreement on a spending bill</a> for 2017 that nearly half the GOP conference hated, the minority party has now racked up an even longer list of priorities.</p>\n<p>There’s DACA, which has taken shape as the top priority. But Democrats also want to see permanent funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers nearly 9 million kids. Congress let CHIP lapse in October, and has since only given temporary funding to pay for the past three months. Some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/8/16865248/100-days-since-chip-funding-expired\">states estimate</a> they will have to begin shutting down their programs before the end of the month if they don’t see relief from Congress. </p>\n<p>With every spending fight, there are a whole host of Democratic “nonstarters” that Republicans have been known to propose. For example, Democrats have made it clear that they will not allow funding for the southern border wall that Trump has insisted on since taking office. Likewise, every effort to defund Planned Parenthood has also been met with organized Democratic opposition.</p>\n<p>“These are all crises being created by congressional Republicans or the president,” one senior Democratic leadership aide said.</p>\n<p>As with all spending fights, this will be a game of chicken between Democrats and Republicans. It’s still not clear which party will blink.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

Steve Alford, gave a shocking response: “What you really need to do is go back in the ’30s and when they outlawed all types of drugs in Kansas [and] across the United States. What was the reason why they did that? One of the reasons why — I hate to say it — it’s the African Americans, they were basically users and they basically responded the worst off those drugs just because their character makeup, their genetics, and that.”</p>\n<p>Alford <a href=\"http://amp.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article193611759.html?__twitter_impression=true\">later apologized</a> for the remarks after facing criticism, saying, “I was wrong, I regret my comments, and I sincerely apologize to anyone whom I have hurt.” But he also insisted, before his apology, that he’s not racist.</p>\n<p>I have been covering drug policy since I was a student journalist in 2010. This is easily the most overtly racist comment I have seen a contemporary politician make on drug policy. It’s a politician saying, outright, that black people are <em>genetically </em>predisposed to an act that he considers negative. (Needless to say, it is absolutely untrue: Black and white people use <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/case-for-marijuana-legalization\">marijuana</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/cards/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth/war-on-drugs-effect\">drugs in general</a> at similar rates, and black and white people report similar rates of <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-DetTabs-2016/NSDUH-DetTabs-2016.htm#tab5-6B\">substance use disorder</a>, according to federal surveys.)</p>\n<p>Although this comment and its explicit racism are more obvious to us today, this kind of racism was in fact one of the ways that American policymakers and elites justified the war on drugs in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>As the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/opinion/high-time-federal-marijuana-ban-is-rooted-in-myth.html\">explained</a>, the federal prohibition of marijuana came during a period of national hysteria about the effect of the drug on Mexican immigrants and black communities. Concerns about a new, exotic drug, coupled with feelings of xenophobia and racism that were all too common in the 1930s, drove law enforcement, the broader public, and eventually legislators to demand the drug’s prohibition. “Police in Texas border towns demonized the plant in racial terms as the drug of ‘immoral’ populations who were promptly labeled ‘fiends,’” Brent Staples wrote for the Times.</p>\n<p>These beliefs extended to practically all forms of drug prohibition. According to historian <a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/peter.knight/research\">Peter Knight</a> at the University of Manchester in the UK, opium largely came over to America with Chinese immigrants on the West Coast. Americans, already skeptical of the drug, quickly latched onto xenophobic beliefs that opium somehow made Chinese immigrants dangerous. “Stories of Chinese immigrants who lured white females into prostitution, along with the media depictions of the Chinese as depraved and unclean, bolstered the enactment of anti-opium laws in eleven states between 1877 and 1900,” Knight <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=war+on+drugs+xenophobia+opium+china+san+francisco&source=bl&ots=tgakPTupDb&sig=5Bw7JgDqQa9Fckg8nHSCtvm5OUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=w4cAVKijFYOQgwTL3YHICg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=war%20on%20drugs%20xenophobia%20opium%20china%20san%20francisco&f=false\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Cocaine was similarly attached in fear to black communities, neuroscientist Carl Hart <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/178158/how-myth-negro-cocaine-fiend-helped-shape-american-drug-policy\">wrote for the Nation</a>. </p>\n<p>The belief was so widespread that the New York Times even felt comfortable writing headlines in 1914 that claimed <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E5D61F3BE633A2575BC0A9649C946596D6CF\">“Negro cocaine ‘fiends’ are a new southern menace.”</a> The author of the Times piece — a physician — wrote, “[The cocaine user] imagines that he hears people taunting and abusing him, and this often incites homicidal attacks upon innocent and unsuspecting victims.” He later added, “Many of the wholesale killings in the South may be cited as indicating that accuracy in shooting is not interfered with — is, indeed, probably improved — by cocaine. … I believe the record of the ‘cocaine n----r’ near Asheville who dropped five men dead in their tracks using only one cartridge for each, offers evidence that is sufficiently convincing.”</p>\n<p>These prejudices help explain the skewed outcomes we see in America’s war on drugs today. Although black and white people <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5940783/prohibition-marijuana-legalization-pot-weed-racism-new-york-times\">use</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/social-mobility-memos/posts/2014/09/30-war-on-drugs-black-social-mobility-rothwell\">sell</a> drugs at similar rates, black people are much more likely to be arrested for drug possession.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"drug use and arrests\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWbLjd_t0by1mrSZ1IgWDvbIABI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3506374/drug_use_and_arrests.0.png\">\n<cite><p>Joe Posner/Vox</p></cite>\n</figure>\n<p>This is not to say in any shape or form that everyone who supports the prohibition of drugs is racist. There are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/20/15328384/opioid-epidemic-drug-legalization\">sensible arguments</a> for legally prohibiting drugs, given how dangerous these substances can be. But these policies have deeply racist roots — and Alford’s remarks offer a reminder of that history.</p>\n<p></p>",

In retaliation, Russian President Vladimir Putin made it so foreign news outlets — like NPR, which is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances\">partially funded</a> by the US federal government — had to identify themselves as foreign agents, too.</p>\n<p>But that clearly that wasn’t enough retaliation for the uber-trolls at RT. NPR reporter Lucian Kim showed up to work Tuesday morning at NPR’s Moscow bureau to discover a tongue-in-cheek <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lucian_Kim/status/950760774514937857\">“Foreign Agent Holiday Care Package”</a> from RT that included RT-branded milk and cookies — yes, milk and cookies. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today I walked into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NPR</a>’s Moscow bureau and found this “holiday care package” from RT: cookies and milk and a sympathetic card. <a href=\"https://t.co/zVlJZSwlqT\">pic.twitter.com/zVlJZSwlqT</a></p>— Lucian Kim (@Lucian_Kim) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lucian_Kim/status/950760774514937857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>It looks like RT, an abbreviation of its former name, Russia Today, is still a tad miffed that many in the United States — especially in the intelligence community — don’t consider it a legitimate news channel, but a Kremlin propaganda mouthpiece.</p>\n<p>RT’s head, Margarita Simonyan, recently pleaded her channel’s innocence to CBS’s Lesley Stahl on Sunday during a <em>60 Minutes</em> segment. “There’s nothing illegal that we did,” Simonyan <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rt-editor-in-chief-on-election-meddling-russian-propaganda-label/\">said</a>. “There’s nothing murky. There’s no weird activity that we’re involved in. Nothing.”</p>\n<p>RT has gone to great lengths to continue playing the victim. Last September, Vox’s Jennifer Williams <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenn_ruth/status/913840441866539009\">spotted</a> this RT banner ad plastered on the side of a car in Washington, DC, traffic: </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just passed this gem in traffic over by the Capitol. <a href=\"https://t.co/w1WTUKoO84\">pic.twitter.com/w1WTUKoO84</a></p>— Jenny from the Vox (@jenn_ruth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenn_ruth/status/913840441866539009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 29, 2017</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>So RT’s “gift” seems like a very dark joke — one that stems from RT’s own insecurities more than anything else.</p>\n<p>That said, I bet the milk and cookies are delicious.</p>",

It is a serious setback for the Trump administration, a rebuke to Perry, and an assertion of FERC’s ongoing independence and integrity. </p>\n<p>It also marks the emergence of a serious national discussion about the performance of the electricity grid, which as regular readers know is an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything\">obsession of mine</a>. Despite Perry’s efforts, however, big piles of coal will not play a prominent role in that discussion.</p>\n<h3>FERC rejected the NOPR for all the right reasons</h3>\n<p>It was clear from the get-go that the NOPR was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/4/16407278/rick-perry-doe-plan-coal-nuclear-energy-markets\">bonkers</a>. Suffice to say, Perry was asking FERC to intervene in energy markets in the crudest possible way, distorting their results based on justifications that were not even facially plausible. </p>\n<p>DOE’s argument was twofold: a) subsidies for renewable energy are driving coal and nuclear plants out of business, and b) the loss of those plants is hurting the reliability and resilience of the electric grid.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"rick perry\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaL3n0l8qn1XH5HYEG4ZcIbA2kM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9105931/rick_perry.jpg\">\n<cite><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Flicense%2F802204118\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Wong/Getty Images</a></cite>\n<figcaption>“What? Sounds good to me!”</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Problem is, neither is true. Even the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/20/16502386/grid-resilience-reliability\">DOE’s own report on grid reliability</a> found otherwise. The premises were also harshly corrected by the historic number of commenters on the proposal. The reactions and comments, as I described at length in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/9/16745084/rick-perry-coal-bailout-ferc\">this post</a>, were overwhelmingly negative, including several technical reports showing that the NOPR would substantially raise costs on consumers, for no benefit. Virtually no one except the corporate entities that stood to directly benefit found the NOPR plausible. </p>\n<p>The proposal’s lack of merits was widely understood in the energy world. What remained in doubt is whether FERC would stand up for energy markets or submit to Trump’s crony capitalism. </p>\n<p>With a few retirements and the slow process of nominations, FERC has been short of a five-member quorum for most of Trump’s administration. Its acting chair, Neil Chatterjee, was an ex-Mitch McConnell staffer who has made supportive noises about the NOPR. It was only a few months ago that the commission got fully staffed up, under the new chair, Kevin McIntyre. Four out of its five members are now Trump appointees (though two, Richard Glick and Cheryl LaFleur, are Democrats). </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"FERC chair Kevin McIntyre\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKK4EdEdfSeQbQniF88GsRD87dQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10001595/slider_mcintyre_3.jpg\">\n<cite><a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/about/com-mem/mcintyre.asp\">FERC</a></cite>\n<figcaption>FERC Chair Kevin McIntyre sees you.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Due to the political intensity of the situation — Trump has made lots of promises to the coal industry — there was some speculation that FERC might try to finesse the issue, though few thought it would simply adopt DOE’s recommendation. </p>\n<p>But there wasn’t much finesse in <a href=\"https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14633130\">yesterday’s unanimous ruling</a>: It terminated the NOPR completely. </p>\n<p>FERC’s core legal justification was simple. To justify a change in energy market rules, petitioners to FERC must do two things. They must show that existing rules are “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential,” and they must show that their proposed rules <em>are</em> just, reasonable, and not discriminatory or preferential.</p>\n<p>In this case, the DOE needed to show that current rules are harming grid resilience, to the detriment of ratepayers, and that its proposed rule is not discriminatory. </p>\n<p>FERC’s commissioners agreed: The DOE failed on both counts.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is exactly the argument we made in our comments - <a href=\"https://t.co/9erUhTqO84\">https://t.co/9erUhTqO84</a></p>— Ari Peskoe (@AriPeskoe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriPeskoe/status/950471096213606400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>The DOE could not show that power plant retirements are threatening reliability. And it certainly couldn’t show that “fuel assurance” — having big piles of coal around — is crucial to grid resilience. </p>\n<p>Three commissioners — LaFleur, Chatterjee, and Glick — wrote separate, concurring statements. Chatterjee, ever the loyalist, says that he still supports his <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/exclusive-chatterjee-details-interim-plan-to-save-coal-nuclear-plants/511044/\">interim plan</a> to subsidize coal plants while FERC makes its judgment. But Glick better captures the commission’s sentiments when he writes that the NOPR “had little, if anything, to do with resilience, and was instead aimed at subsidizing certain uncompetitive electric generation technologies.”</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An interesting detail from the concurring statement on the FERC decision by Richard Glick. In the bomb cyclone, almost half the outages on PJM have come from coal-fired plants <a href=\"https://t.co/H7YlNFsaJ6\">pic.twitter.com/H7YlNFsaJ6</a></p>— Ed Crooks (@Ed_Crooks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Crooks/status/950522407911088134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>LaFleur wrote that “the Commission should continue to focus its efforts not on slowing the transition from the past but on easing the transition to the future.” (Glick and LaFleur both also mention climate change, which Perry never has.)</p>\n<p>My inbox is groaning under supportive statements from environmentalists, energy industry groups, energy researchers and analysts, politicians, and your cousin Gary for the decision. It’s a clear signal that energy markets will be allowed to do their work and good news for anyone who supports forward-looking energy policy.</p>\n<h3>FERC will undertake a rational assessment of grid reliability</h3>\n<p>Though they rejected all his arguments and proposals, FERC commissioners thanked Perry for, ahem, drawing attention to the issue of grid reliability and resilience. As the DOE grid study documented, there have been lots of big changes in the electricity sector in the past decade, so it’s worth taking a fresh look at how to maintain a steady grid.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, FERC will begin a process of gathering information on the subject to determine if further action is warranted. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In the new docket, here is what FERC has committed to: <a href=\"https://t.co/MNiEbttUZG\">pic.twitter.com/MNiEbttUZG</a></p>— Avi Zevin (@azevin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/azevin/status/950485371640565761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Specifically, FERC will ask the country’s ISOs and RTOs — the organizations that run regional energy markets — to report back within 60 days with answers to 18 questions about how they evaluate the resilience of their systems. They will also be asked to weigh in on four possible FERC actions to support resilience. </p>\n<p>FERC specifically instructs ISOs and RTOs to look beyond fuel assurance to a “broader consideration of resilience issues.”</p>\n<p>This new proceeding on resilience gives at least a tiny bit of political cover for Perry, confirmation that he’s raised a valid subject, but ... it’s not much. This isn’t a new rulemaking or a proposal for rulemaking. It’s the beginning of an informal information-gathering process that may or may not widen in scope.</p>\n<h3>The resilience discussion will continue</h3>\n<p>In the near term and the long term, Perry’s dream of a coal bailout seems forlorn. The considered, deliberative process to assess grid resilience he’s kicked off is not going to conclude that big piles of coal are key to national security. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One last point. DOE's bungling of this from the start (no coordination, proposal unlike a normal 206 proceeding, Perry's performance at House Energy hearing) very likely hurt its ability to get near-term policy in the direction it wanted (even if less than cost-of-service).</p>— Avi Zevin (@azevin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/azevin/status/950487377327292416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>All hopes for coal and nuclear now reside with ISOs and RTOs, professional organizations that pride themselves on independence and technical expertise and have invested years of effort in getting energy markets working. </p>\n<p>Their path forward is looking rocky.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEI, big NOPR supporter, hints at the next lobbying target for it and coal:<br>&quot;We believe the direction to the RTOs/ISOs to ‘take a proactive stance on addressing and ensuring resilience’ must lead to prompt and meaningful action, including on issues such as price formation.” <a href=\"https://t.co/QkOvJOwIZh\">https://t.co/QkOvJOwIZh</a></p>— Gavin Bade (@GavinBade) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinBade/status/950522614715437064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Nuclear has another appeal to make, of course — it is low-carbon. That is, at the very least, a great reason to keep every existing nuclear plant open until the last coal plant is closed. Under Trump, however, the nuclear industry has proven willing to toss that argument overboard and tie its fate to coal’s, which strikes me, and many others, as a fateful strategic error.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The nuclear industry should be relieved that the NOPR was unceremoniously rejected. &quot;Resilience&quot; payments would have helped in the short term but tied nuclear economically and politically to coal, which is in long term decline, we argued in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForeignAffairs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ForeignAffairs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DX2fF2d9w2\">https://t.co/DX2fF2d9w2</a></p>— Varun Sivaram (@vsiv) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vsiv/status/950506236205727745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Whatever nuclear’s argument, though, it has nothing to do with <em>resilience</em>. Resilience is an attribute of the electricity system, not any individual element within it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://rhg.com/notes/the-real-electricity-reliability-crisis\">overwhelming majority</a> of electricity disturbances originate in damage to power poles and power lines — the grid itself. Grid resilience is likely to be best served by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/15/16714146/greener-more-reliable-more-resilient-grid-microgrids\">better, smarter grid architecture</a>, networking together a diversity of small and midsize resources (perhaps someday including small nuclear plants). I’ll have more to say on grid architecture soon. </p>\n<p>For now, it’s enough to say that a blow was struck this week for evidence-based policymaking. In pursuit of crony capitalism, Perry blundered into a nest of wonks. He did not fare well. </p>",

It was the first time both sides had sat down for official negotiations in more than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16853700/north-korea-south-talks-olympics\">two years</a>. </p>\n<p>North Korea <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/koreas-near-olympics-deal-north-avoids-nuclear-talk-1515488910\">refused</a> to discuss its nuclear and missile programs during the nearly 12-hour negotiations, but the two sides <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-accepts-olympic-team-north-countries-hold/story?id=52223379\">agreed</a> to hold military talks to lower animosities at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>Pyongyang will also send a delegation of government officials, fans, reporters, and even a taekwondo demonstration team to the games on February 9. “Senior officials from North and South Korea will be able to mingle naturally at the Winter Olympics alongside members of the international community and thereby provide an opportunity to discuss current affairs,” the South Korean government <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/koreas-near-olympics-deal-north-avoids-nuclear-talk-1515488910\">announced</a> in a statement.</p>\n<p>Both sides will continue talking about North Korea’s Olympic presence, including whether North Korean <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-accepts-olympic-team-north-countries-hold/story?id=52223379\">cheerleaders</a> should cheer alongside their South Korean counterparts as a single unit or do so separately. </p>\n<p>For most of last year, it looked like the United States and North Korea were careening toward a potentially <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/18/16733560/north-korea-war\">catastrophic war</a>, a conflict that would’ve also involved South Korea. </p>\n<p>But these talks are a small yet promising sign that North Korea might<em> </em>try to avoid that outcome — even though that’s not a certainty at this point.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear weapons aren’t on the negotiating table yet</h3>\n<p>Despite South Korea’s attempts to get North Korea to discuss its nuclear and ballistic missile programs at the talks on Tuesday, the North flatly refused.</p>\n<p>Ri Son Gwon, North Korea’s top official at the negotiations, told reporters after the meeting that it would be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/koreas-near-olympics-deal-north-avoids-nuclear-talk-1515488910\">“ridiculous”</a> to bring up Pyongyang’s weapons programs at these talks because they were “strictly aimed at the US” and thus “do not target our brethren” (meaning South Korea).</p>\n<p>Experts I <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/1/4/16849258/north-korea-south-call-olympics-trump\">spoke</a> with earlier this week indicated that North Korea had one goal in mind during these talks — get its athletes to the Olympics — and to stop joint US–South Korea military drills. </p>\n<p>There was an opportunity for North Korea to exploit. On January 4, President Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/politics/us-south-korea-drills-intl/index.html\">accepted</a> South Korea’s offer to halt yearly military drills until after the Olympics. Pyongyang views US–South Korea military drills are merely a rehearsal for war with North Korea. It’s unclear if Trump’s decision had anything to do with North Korea’s recent willingness to talk to South Korea. </p>\n<p>But at least North Korea is at the table instead of continuing its war of words — for now. After the Olympics, it’s possible tensions will revert back to 2017 levels.</p>",

Some of his accusers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/11/16761946/trump-metoo-megyn-kelly-accusers\">spoke out</a> as recently as last month, renewing their allegations in light of the #MeToo movement. </p>\n<p>Trump herself has been the subject of her father’s sexist behavior: In 2004, Donald Trump told radio DJ <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/trump-on-howard-stern/\">Howard Stern</a> that it was okay to characterize Ivanka as “a piece of ass” and <a href=\"https://forward.com/schmooze/357185/6-creepy-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-ivanka/\">famously said he would be romantically interested in Ivanka if she weren’t his daughter</a>. Last year, then-candidate Trump <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/290065-trump-i-hope-ivanka-would-change-jobs-if-sexually\">said</a> he thought his daughter should change jobs or careers if she were sexually harassed at work — not that the harasser should be held accountable. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12815178/ivanka-trump-sexual-harassment\">Ivanka gave women</a> some questionable advice for dealing with sexual harassment in her 2009 book, <em>The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Business and in Life</em>: “Learn to figure out when a hoot or a holler is indeed a form of harassment and when it’s merely a good-natured tease that you can give back in kind.”</p>\n<p>She <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/ivanka-trump-roy-moore/index.html\">spoke out against</a> Alabama Republican Roy Moore, who was accused by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/13/16643422/roy-moore-republican-party\">several women of sexual misconduct</a>, including incidents that happened when several of the women were teenagers. But when her father supported the failed US Senate candidate, she made no public pushback. </p>\n<h3>The public didn’t buy Ivanka’s #MeToo bandwagoning </h3>\n<p>Observers were quick to note the hypocrisy of Ivanka Trump’s support for Oprah’s message and the women who have come forward to tell their stories of harassment and abuse in recent months.

She <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/03/ivanka-trump-sexual-harassment-should-never-tolerated/\">told an audience</a> in Tokyo in November that the sexual harassment of women should “never be tolerated,” and that “all too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect.”</p>\n<h3>Ivanka Trump is a failed feminist at best</h3>\n<p>Trump has, throughout her career, sought to cast herself as an advocate for feminism and her brand as one of empowerment. Last year she released a book, <em>Women Who Work</em>, which was <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/review-roundup-ivanka-trumps-women-who-work-panned-by-critics-1001455\">widely panned</a> as shallow and generic. Her brand is geared toward a lifestyle and affluence to which most women can only aspire, and broadly, many of her efforts on the feminism front have <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-ivanka-trump-women-hypocrite-20170905-story.html\">fallen short</a>. </p>\n<p>She has been supportive of, or at least complicit in, many of her father’s policies that adversely affect women. She backed President Trump’s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/31/politics/white-house-ivanka-trump-equal-pay-data/index.html\">move to end</a> an Obama-era rule on gender gap wage data collection and stood by as he sought to undermine women’s health and rights, including the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/11/10/13578550/trump-obamacare-birth-control-iuds\">reversal</a> of Obamacare’s birth control mandate. She advocated for a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16652644/congress-child-tax-credit-senators-rubio-gardner\">child tax credit</a> in the Republican tax bill but has remained silent on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the funding for which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/8/16865248/100-days-since-chip-funding-expired\">expired</a> more than 100 days ago. </p>\n<p>In response to a March 2017 <em>Saturday Night Live </em>skit parodying her in a commercial for a perfume called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7o4oMKbStE\">“Complicit,”</a> Trump said in an interview with CBS that her complicity means “wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact.” She added, “I would not conflate lack of public denouncement with silence.”</p>\n<p>To be sure, the fault for President Trump’s bad behavior cannot be placed on his daughter. His words and decisions, including decades of alleged sexual misconduct, are his.</p>\n<p>But Ivanka’s #MeToo bandwagoning is in poor taste, and many just aren’t buying her feminist positioning, after the Oprah tweet or before it. Actress Helen Mirren in an <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a57005/helen-mirren-ivanka-trump-melania-trump-feminism/\">August interview</a> with Allure offered her assessment of the first daughter: “[Ivanka] talks a good game, but there’s no substance.”</p>",

Average life expectancy here dropped for the second year in a row, according to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/12/13/13926618/mortality-trends-america-causes-death-by-county\">recent data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grim trend stems from a toxic mixture of more drug- and alcohol-related deaths and more heart disease and obesity in many parts of the country. And it puts Americans at a higher risk of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/11/7/9684928/angus-deaton-white-mortality\">early death compared</a> to their counterparts in other wealthy countries.</p>\n<p>But what’s often lost in the conversation about the uptick in mortality here is that this trend isn’t affecting <em>all</em> Americans. In fact, there’s one group in the US that’s actually doing better than ever: the rich. While poor and middle-class Americans are dying earlier these days, the wealthiest among us are enjoying unprecedented longevity. </p>\n<p>So when we talk about life expectancy slipping, what we should also talk about is the growing problem of health inequality in America. And it’s an increasingly urgent discussion, health researchers are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-congress/column-with-u-s-life-expectancy-gains-down-tax-bill-will-make-things-worse-idUSKBN1EF1GE\">warning</a>, because of policy changes on the horizon that are poised to make the mortality gap even wider. </p>\n<p>Some of these policies will hamper access to medical care (such as failing to fund <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/5/16856000/chip-funding-expiring-january-19\">CHIP, the health insurance program for low-income children</a>) but others that aren’t even directly related to health care — like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/2/16720952/senate-tax-bill-inequality\">tax cuts</a> — may have even more insidious effects on the American mortality gap. </p>\n<h3>America’s alarming life expectancy gap </h3>\n<p>The rich have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/25/11501370/health-longevity-inequality-life-expectancy\">long-enjoyed more longevity than the poor</a>, but the gap in life expectancy has been widening in the US over the last few decades, along with other types of social and income inequality here. </p>\n<p>The CDC’s Division of Vital Statistics, which tracks mortality in the US, uses death certificates as the data source, and doesn’t collect family income data. But we do have good data on the mortality gap and income from a study published in <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2513561#Results\"><em>JAMA</em></a><em> </em>in 2016. </p>\n<p>A group of researchers, led by Stanford University economist Raj Chetty, analyzed income data for the US population from 1.4 billion tax records between 1999 and 2014. They then compared it with mortality data from Social Security Administration death records. They found that, from 2001 to 2014, the richest Americans gained about five years of longevity, while life expectancy for the poor didn’t budge: </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7OC96QVPlpOmW9wdZP47dy6Aik4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9995881/Screen_Shot_2018_01_08_at_10.35.48_AM.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2513561?redirect=true\">JAMA</a></cite>\n<figcaption>Changes in race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy by income group, 2001 to 2014.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>They also found that men who were among the top 1 percent of income earners lived 15 years longer than men at the bottom 1 percent. For women at the extremes of the income distribution, life expectancy differed by 10 years. At Vox, we broke their data down by state, and you can see that wealthier Americans are living longer than poorer Americans all across the country. (Here’s the data on men, but the same trends hold <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/25/11501370/health-longevity-inequality-life-expectancy\">for women</a>.) </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NU4PlxYhZ1cHtiXMmOsNC1mAa-4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9995905/men.png\">\n<cite>Alvin Chang/Vox</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>This life expectancy divide between rich and poor Americans has been growing for decades. A report from the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321309/\">National Academies of Science</a> looked at life expectancy by income groups between 1980 and 2010. In 1980, the richest cohort of middle-age American men could expect to live until about 83 and the poorest, to 76. By 2010, the richest American males had gained six years in life expectancy, living to 89 on average, while life expectancy for the poorest men hadn’t improved. (The Washington Post has nice visualizations of the data in the report <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/18/the-government-is-spending-more-to-help-rich-seniors-than-poor-ones/?utm_term=.5121b7d0b571\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>“Because we have widening income inequality and there’s a bigger gap between haves and have nots,” said Steven Woolf, a <a href=\"https://tiih.org/who/people/scholars-and-fellows/steven-woolf/\">researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University</a> who has been researching income and mortality. “We are seeing a bigger divide in mortality.” </p>\n<h3>Tax reform and other Trump-era policies are expected to make the gap worse</h3>\n<p>This growing gap should be “a dramatic reminder of what actually affects our health,” Woolf added. </p>\n<p>We often think about health status in terms of access to doctors, hospitals, and medicines. But access to health care only accounts for about 10 to 20 percent of our health outcomes. Far more influential on our health is our socioeconomic status and certain health behaviors, like smoking, eating healthfully, and getting exercise.</p>\n<p>In Chetty’s study, for example, the researchers found that life expectancy among the poorest individuals was “significantly correlated” with health behaviors like smoking, obesity, and exercise. Poorer people are more likely to be overweight, smoke, and drink compared to their wealthier counterparts. Interestingly, these effects seemed to be mitigated in places that had enacted policies to curb poor health behaviors — such as anti-smoking laws or trans fat bans in cities. </p>\n<p>Right now, there are several policies on the horizon that are not only expected to hamper health care access, but exacerbate income inequality — and widen the life expectancy disparity, <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/about-us/staff-contact-information/executive-managers/staff-contact-folder/blumenthal-david\">David Blumenthal</a>, president of the Commonwealth Fund, says. Blumenthal <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2017/nov/senate-tax-bill-worsen-health-outcomes\">has written</a> about the potential effects of the tax bill, which passed through the Senate in December, on low- and middle-income Americans in particular, and how it’ll disproportionately ding them while rich Americans and corporations will enjoy tax breaks:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If the Senate tax legislation becomes law, Americans earning less than $75,000 would face higher taxes on average by 2027, according to <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5040\">the Joint Commission on Taxation’s estimates of the bill’s distributional effects</a>. The bill has varying effects on different income groups in different years, but consistently cuts taxes for the richest Americans. For example, individuals earning less than $10,000 would see their federal taxes go up on average by $182 each year until 2027. People earning a million dollars or more would, on average, see their taxes fall by $6,800 annually over the next decade.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Blumenthal told Vox, “We can expect ... to see the gap in life expectancy and health care outcomes between low- and high-income Americans grow in coming years if gaps in income increase.” </p>\n<p>Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/2/16720952/senate-tax-bill-inequality\">Dylan Scott and Alvin Chang</a> have also argued that the tax bill — because of its tax breaks for the rich — “takes the wheel of America’s already-dramatic income inequality and presses the accelerator.” It’ll also repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate, resulting in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance. That’s not to mention Congress’s failure to fund <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/5/16856000/chip-funding-expiring-january-19\">CHIP</a> and its proposed cuts to Medicaid — health insurance programs for low-income American children and adults — both moves that have been endorsed by the Trump administration, </p>\n<p>So instead of just focusing on the overall decline in life expectancy, we need to start talking about these links between policy, and worsening income inequality and its relationship to the growing mortality gap. If we don’t, Woolf warned, we’ll fail to see the solutions to America’s early death problem.</p>",

But viewers still face tough moral and aesthetic decisions.</p> <p>The men of film, television, and radio who have been charged with sexual harassment and abuse are rapidly disappearing from the entertainment landscape.</p>\n<p>Minnesota Public Radio has decided to stick reruns of <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> in the vault following allegations against Garrison Keillor. You will never again hear those meandering tales about Lake Wobegon that either captivated or irritated you — at least not on the public airwaves (and his musical guests are collateral damage). Louis C.K.’s shows for HBO have <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/hbo-removes-louis-cks-projects-from-streaming-services/\">vanished</a>, and his movie <em>I Love You, Daddy</em> was shelved before it opened. </p>\n<p>Kevin Spacey, already fired from <em>House of Cards</em>, was literally snipped out of the new film about the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty’s grandson in 1973, <em>All the Money in the World, </em>and replaced by Christopher Plummer in hastily reshot scenes. </p>\n<p>And fans of the animated series <em>Gravity Falls </em>might notice that one character sounds a little different: Louis C.K.’s voice was removed and redubbed with that of series creator Alex Hirsch — a powerfully metaphorical act at a time when there’s so much talk of the relative weight of harassers’ and victims’ voices. </p>\n<p>For those who want to go further and take it on themselves to avoid the art of alleged harassers, there’s <a href=\"https://therottenappl.es/\">Rotten Apples</a>, a site that flags films tied to people facing allegations of sexual harassment. Type <em>Good Will Hunting</em> into the site’s search engine and up pops a list including Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, and Harvey Weinstein — with hyperlinks to stories about the allegations against them. Type in any Woody Allen movie and — well, you get the point. (<em>All</em> of Alfred Hitchcock now comes with an asterisk, because he was allegedly abusive toward Tippi Hedren.) </p>\n<p>The drive to erase alleged sex predators from the entertainment landscape is understandable. These men built careers exploiting the women and men over whom they had power, but they also involved the rest of us in their predation, turning us into unwitting accomplices who consumed their art and lined their pockets. Part of removing them from streaming services or public radio networks is about ending that complicity; it’s the industry’s response to the audience’s revulsion.</p>\n<p>But the decisions by the entertainment industry to pull shows represent a flattened version of an important debate. The industry clearly bears responsibility for making sure the perpetrators are removed from positions of power. But distributors of preexisting works are surely mainly driven by the profit motive: They’re worried that audiences will be offended by any company associated with sex predators and walk away.</p>\n<p>Despite the erasures, audiences still have to navigate their relationship to the art that remains available. We all have to evaluate how we relate to it both externally and internally (as I’ve come to think of it). By “externally,” I mean: What is the significance of consuming — and therefore supporting, financially or in terms of prestige — the art of a sexual predator? By “internally,” I mean: How does it change the experiences of consuming that art? </p>\n<h3>These questions aren’t new. Nor have they gotten any easier.</h3>\n<p>These aesthetic questions did not emerge for the first time with the Weinstein revelations. Indeed, the question of whether to boycott Allen’s films has generated so much controversy over the years that the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/on-boycotting-woody-allens-films.html?_r=0\">handed it over</a> in 2014 to their ethicist columnist, in this case Chuck Klosterman.</p>\n<p>His equivocal answer reveals how difficult of a question it is to untangle. On the one hand, Klosterman argued, you don’t need a logical reason to avoid watching <em>any </em>film; it’s not like jury duty. But if you do revisit <em>Annie Hall</em> or <em>Manhattan</em>, he said, “The obligation of the audience is to watch with a fair mind: to neither deny what you know about its real-world creation nor fabricate a fictional subtext that suits what you want to believe.”</p>\n<p>Which is murky advice for a murky quandary: What defines fair-mindedness in parsing subtext of a Woody Allen film, given the obsessive attention given to young women in his work (a theme, moreover, far more evident in <em>Manhattan</em> than <em>Annie Hall</em>)? </p>\n<p>It’s one thing to say you don’t want to rent a Woody Allen movie because he’ll profit. But how does it affect us internally to watch a film knowing the (alleged) bad acts of the auteur who created it? Or take the similar case of watching <em>The Cosby Show</em>, long beloved for its depiction of a middle-class black family at a time when such depictions were almost entirely absent from the cultural landscape. When scores of women came forward to detail their experiences of sexual harassment and assault by its star, TV Land pulled reruns of the show (though it’s still watchable on Amazon).</p>\n<p>“I think an argument can be made, in some cases, for separating an entertainer’s personal life, however messy it is, from how one feels about their art,” <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rewatching-the-cosby-show-is-brutal_us_568abf1ee4b014efe0db1eb6\">wrote</a> Zeba Blay, culture writer for the Huffington Post. “But the fact that Cosby used his Cliff Huxtable persona as leverage for allegedly perpetrating and hiding his assaults makes that impossible for me to do.”</p>\n<p>How does an audience member <em>not </em>view a Louis C.K. set differently when he jokes about the danger men represent to women? Having now admitted to being one of those dangerous men, his comedy takes on a darker, predatory tone, as a cover for bad acts rather than a genuine attempt at observational jokes. Humor that was once cringe-inducing becomes stomach-churning. </p>\n<h3>Make the works available, so viewers can decide</h3>\n<p>As a historian, I strongly believe that it’s important that we keep these men’s work accessible. Woody Allen films are a genuinely important part of American film history. <em>The Cosby Show</em> is key to understanding representation in media and tangled issues of race, class, and acceptance. But I also can’t imagine watching old episodes simply for entertainment.</p>\n<p>Allen’s and Cosby’s work holds little personal weight for me. But I do continue to watch one of my most beloved shows, <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, even though Louis C.K. plays a recurring role in the second season. But now when he appears on-screen, the warmth of watching a beloved character is gone, and instead I find myself thinking not of the character Dave Sanderson but of the abuser Louis C.K., and my sense of escapism is shattered. Now I skip those episodes. </p>\n<p>This isn’t simply a matter of personal revulsion. There is a genuine moral problem at the heart of continuing to consume shows starring these men for pure entertainment purposes. Consuming fiction requires people to wall off certain information they have: that these are actors, that there’s a script, that there is no fourth wall on that familiar living room set. That’s not information I can set aside any more, not only because I simply <em>can’t</em> forget, but also because to set it aside is to conclude that my need to be entertained by a particular work is more important than my need to remain aware of, and appalled by, the abuses these men have committed. </p>\n<p>Such a calculation necessarily requires diminishing the importance of the abuse to something less than, at most, a few hours of entertainment. That’s a gross devaluation of the victims and their experiences. </p>\n<p>But many cases remain complicated, including the movie <em>Frida</em>. The film was distributed by Harvey Weinstein at Miramax. And thanks to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/13/opinion/contributors/salma-hayek-harvey-weinstein.html\">a recent essay</a> by the film’s star and producer, Salma Hayek, we know that Weinstein used the film to sexually harass and exploit her. (Among other things, he forced her to do a gratuitous nude love scene, Hayek says.) So pull it, right? Scrub it from the universe. At the least, don’t watch it. </p>\n<p>Except we also know that the film was intensely personal to Hayek, the result of tireless effort to bring the story of Frida Kahlo to the big screen. Avoiding the film because it is a Weinstein production punishes the woman who endured his harassment in order to bring her vision to life. No artistic product belongs entirely to one person, especially in the world of film and broadcasting — auteur theory aside. </p>\n<p>To take the discussion out of the realm of modern cinema for a moment, consider the case of Paul Gauguin. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/arts/design/gauguin-its-not-just-genius-vs-monster.html?_r=0\">pathbreaking French artist</a> not only abused his wife but regularly had sex with — abused — the Tahitian girls he painted, some as young as 13. Many of the girls and women in his famed portraits are not just his subjects — they are his victims. Sexual violence abounds in his work. So what do we do with this information? Gaugin remains a crowd favorite. Should institutions cease exhibiting his paintings? Should they warn visitors? </p>\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer, though we can probably build consensus on a few absolutes: Banishing a person’s work from exhibitions goes too far; letting living abusers go unpunished doesn’t go far enough. </p>\n<p>Beyond that, each case demands nuanced judgment that somehow avoids excuse-making, something our culture is particularly ill-suited for at this moment. And, yes, it does seem unfair to give such patient, careful regard to men who had no such care for the women and men they abused. </p>\n<p>But as with most contentious questions, the answer seems to boil down to “more, not less”: <em>more</em> awareness of what these men have done and how it has affected their art and their colleagues, <em>more</em> debate over the best place for their art in our society, <em>more</em> opportunities for their victims and their art. In that light, we might view the Rotten Apples site not as an invitation to never watch a Hitchcock film again, but rather to think harder when we do.</p>\n<p>We don’t need to erase these men and their art, but we can no longer see it as unalloyed entertainment or drama, hermetically sealed off from the “real world.” The moral compromise required to view it in that way is too great. And as the last few months have constantly reminded us, we’ve already made enough moral compromises.</p>\n<p><em>Nicole Hemmer, a Vox columnist, is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15571.html\"><strong>Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics</strong></a>. <em>She is an assistant professor at the University of Virginia’s </em><a href=\"http://millercenter.org/\"><em><strong>Miller Center</strong></em></a><em> and co-host of the </em><a href=\"http://www.pastpresentpodcast.com/\"><strong>Past Present</strong></a> <em>podcast.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://vox.com/the-big-idea\">The Big Idea</a> is Vox’s home for smart discussion of the most important issues and ideas in politics, science, and culture — typically by outside contributors.

Now they have to deal with the fact that he is.</p> <p>As the old saying goes, every cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and ends as a racket. Donald Trump’s political career has proceeded in reverse. It began as a racket, became a business, sparked a movement, and ended in a presidency. It is that bizarre, benighted progression, argues Michael Wolff in his book <em>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</em><em>,</em> that explains much of the Trump administration’s irresolvable dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Wolff’s tell-all has launched to enviable press, publicity, and controversy. President Trump dismissed it as “a Fake Book, written by a totally discredited author,” while also directing his lawyers to try to stop its publication. (They failed, though the effort shot the book up the best-seller lists). </p>\n<p>At the same time, Trump has treated its revelations as gospel truth, launching <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16845920/trump-michael-wolff-book-steve-bannon\">a blood feud against Steve Bannon</a>, his former chief strategist, based on Wolff’s recounting of Bannon’s comments. The media has delighted over the backbiting, sniping, leaking, and despair that Wolff got on the record — or, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">depending on whom you believe</a>, did not get on the record but published anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Fire and Fury</em> has its limits. It’s heavily based on a few sources — Ben Domenech, in an allusion to Hillary Clinton’s post-election tome, <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2018/01/08/michael-wolffs-error-filled-book-steve-bannons-happened/\">calls it</a> “Steve Bannon’s <em>What Happened</em>” — and riddled with typos and small but glaring factual errors (like that John Boehner left the House in 2011, rather than 2015). </p>\n<p>At the same time, the book, read as a whole, contains real insight into the inner workings of the Trump administration. Though it presents itself as an insider account of Trump’s first months in office, it is too narrow in scope to serve that purpose: Wolff is clearly bored by questions of governance and policy, so there’s relatively little about what the Trump administration actually did, and why it did it. </p>\n<p>Instead, Wolff has written an insider’s account of what it’s like to work for Donald Trump. This is a book about the collection of cronies, opportunists, misfits, functionaries, family members, and public servants who have tried to construct something that acts and operates like a presidency around a man who neither acts nor operates like a president, a man they all know shouldn’t be the president. </p>\n<p>More importantly, it is a book about why they’re failing. </p>\n<h3>Trump wasn’t supposed to win</h3>\n<p>What you need to understand about Trump’s presidency, Wolff says, it that it was never meant to happen. And if it had never happened, perhaps it would have all worked out fine.</p>\n<p>The beginning of<em> </em><em>Fire and Fury</em> is about what Trump’s team, including the candidate, expected to do after he lost. Steve Bannon “would become the de facto head of the Tea Party movement,” Kellyanne Conway “would now be one of the leading conservative voices on cable news,” Reince Priebus and Katie Walsh “would get their Republican Party back,” Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump “would have transformed themselves from relatively obscure rich kids into international celebrities,” and Melania Trump “could return to inconspicuously lunching.”</p>\n<p>As for Donald Trump? His plans were, well, yuge. He “would be the most famous man in the world.” Alongside Roger Ailes, he was thinking of launching his own television network — Trump TV, a network by him, about him, and for the millions and millions of people he had proven he understood better than the Republican Party, Fox News, or Paul Ryan. </p>\n<p>“I don’t think about losing because it isn’t losing,” Trump reportedly told Ailes a week before the election, when he and everyone else thought he was going to lose. “We’ve totally won.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Michael Wolff's Book On Trump Administration Released Early Due To Demand\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKp2JdWhZPoJnAk30-y8qMYGr6E=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9999593/901602814.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>The Trump campaign began as a nice racket. Get some money from the rich guy with the big ego and the checkbook to match. It took off, and it became a nice business — if you’d jumped aboard early, you rocketed to the forefront of conservative politics, bypassing the careerists and operatives who got the blue-chip political jobs you couldn’t, the bootlickers and Ivy Leaguers who had looked down on you for so long. To get a candidate that flawed to the nomination, to a respectable loss, that was miracle work, and you would be seen as a miracle worker. </p>\n<p>Trump’s staff, Wolff says, knew that it wasn’t meant to go beyond that. “Almost everybody in the campaign, still an extremely small outfit, thought of themselves as a clear-eyed team, as realistic about their prospects as perhaps any in politics. The unspoken agreement among them: not only would Donald Trump not be president, he should probably not be. Conveniently, the former conviction meant nobody had to deal with the latter issue.”</p>\n<p>Then they had to. Wolff frames the reckoning nicely:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Trump campaign had, perhaps less than inadvertently, replicated the scheme from Mel Brooks’s The Producers. In that classic, Brooks’s larcenous and dopey heroes, Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, set out to sell more than 100 percent of the ownership stakes in the Broadway show they are producing. Since they will be found out only if the show is a hit, everything about the show is premised on its being a flop. Accordingly, they create a show so outlandish that it actually succeeds, thus dooming our heroes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To Wolff, many of the Trump administration’s current problems lie in this cracked foundation. Why release your tax returns if you’re never going to win? What’s the harm in sucking up to Russia’s government if you’re likelier to build a hotel in Moscow than to occupy the White House? Who needs to build a real policy operation, or work through a process of educating the candidate on major policy issues, if he’s never going to govern? Why concern yourself with conflicts of interest or business entanglements if they’re never going to matter?</p>\n<p>But all of this raises the question: What was so awful about Trump that even his own staff, his own family, believed he shouldn’t be president?</p>\n<h3>“The central issue of the Trump presidency”: Trump is not fit to be president</h3>\n<p>Wolff’s book is full of, um, candid assessments of Donald Trump’s intellectual capacity — although many of them, it should be said, appear to be second- or thirdhand, so believe the specific wording at your own risk. </p>\n<p>“An idiot,” according to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and, separately, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Wolff wrote.</p>\n<p>“A fucking idiot,” according to Rupert Murdoch.</p>\n<p>“A fucking moron,” according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. </p>\n<p>“A child,” according to former Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh.</p>\n<p>“A dope,” according to National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. </p>\n<p>“Dumb as shit,” according to National Economics Council Director Gary Cohn.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"US-CHINA-TRUMP-MEMORANDUM\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rghk4mFD29UY-ZM9VKsXEmuhuAU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9999647/831418274.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>The value of Wolff’s book, though, isn’t in the judgments themselves, but in the more nuanced portrait of Trump’s deficiencies. For instance:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here was, arguably, the central issue of the Trump presidency, informing every aspect of Trumpian policy and leadership: he didn’t process information in any conventional sense — or, in a way, he didn’t process it at all. Trump didn’t read. He didn’t really even skim. If it was print, it might as well not exist. Some believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semiliterate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For anything that smacked of a classroom or of being lectured to — “professor” was one of his bad words, and he was proud of never going to class, never buying a textbook, never taking a note — he got up and left the room. This was a problem in multiple respects — indeed, in almost all the prescribed functions of the presidency.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What was, to many of the people who knew Trump well, much more confounding was that he had managed to win this election, and arrive at this ultimate accomplishment, wholly lacking what in some obvious sense must be the main requirement of the job, what neuroscientists would call executive function. He had somehow won the race for president, but his brain seemed incapable of performing what would be essential tasks in his new job. He had no ability to plan and organize and pay attention and switch focus; he had never been able to tailor his behavior to what the goals at hand reasonably required. On the most basic level, he simply could not link cause and effect. </p></blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here was another peculiar Trump attribute: an inability to see his actions the way most others saw them. Or to fully appreciate how people expected him to behave. The notion of the presidency as an institutional and political concept, with an emphasis on ritual and propriety and semiotic messaging — statesmanship — was quite beyond him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolff also quotes an internal White House email, apparently representing Gary Cohn’s views:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won’t read anything — not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The picture painted of Trump in Wolff’s book is the same picture painted of Trump by Trump’s own tweets, speeches, comments, and actions, as well as the constant on- and off-the-record statements of his staff. It is similar to what I, and many other reporters who have covered this White House, have heard from top staff. Trump is not cognitively up to the job of the presidency. He’s not just someone who doesn’t know much about policy or foreign affairs, he’s someone who doesn’t <em>want</em> to know much about policy or foreign affairs, who dislikes the methods by which you actually could learn about policy or foreign affairs. </p>\n<p>In this telling, Trump’s ignorance isn’t an absence of knowledge; it’s closer to a personality trait, perhaps even an ideology.</p>\n<p>And while there’s been some pushback to individual stories and quotes in Wolff’s account, there’s really not been pushback to these assessments. Axios’s Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, who are deeply sourced in the Trump administration, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/the-wolff-lines-on-trump-that-ring-unambiguously-true-1515262293-78cf5551-daf2-4c2e-a3de-83da6971f578.html\">write</a> that while they believe parts of Wolff’s book “are wrong, sloppy, or betray off-the-record confidence,” the sections relating to “how Trump processes (and resists) information,” his preference for “instinct over expertise,” his “ill-preparedness,” and the “low regard” in which he’s held by key aides “ring unambiguously true.” </p>\n<h3>How do you build a functional presidency without a functional president?</h3>\n<p>So what happens when a man who isn’t fit to be president and a campaign that never expected to staff and manage a presidency unexpectedly wins the White House? Chaos.</p>\n<p>Most of Wolff’s book recounts the dual-front challenge of the Trump administration’s first few months in office. </p>\n<p>Challenge 1: How do you please, placate, manage, constrain, and inform a raging child-king? The answer, embarrassing but at this point <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/7/16860046/cnn-jake-tapper-stephen-miller\">known to Trump’s staff</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-20/trump-opens-first-presidential-trip-abroad-in-saudi-arabia\">any foreign government</a> that might want to curry America’s favor, is flattery and sycophancy. </p>\n<p>Challenge 2: How do you harness the remarkable opportunity you’ve been given to actually build something of value? </p>\n<p>The central struggle of Trump’s early months was between chief strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and chief son-in-law Jared Kushner. All of them, in their proximity to power, saw the potential to build a presidency they could be proud of, or at least less disgraced by:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each man saw the president as something of a blank page — or a scrambled one. And each, Walsh came to appreciate with increasing incredulity, had a radically different idea of how to fill or remake that page. Bannon was the alt-right militant. Kushner was the New York Democrat. And Priebus was the establishment Republican. “Steve wants to force a million people out of the country and repeal the nation’s health law and lay on a bunch of tariffs that will completely decimate how we trade, and Jared wants to deal with human trafficking and protecting Planned Parenthood.” And Priebus wanted Donald Trump to be another kind of Republican altogether ... </p>\n<p>As Walsh saw it, Steve Bannon was running the Steve Bannon White House, Jared Kushner was running the Michael Bloomberg White House, and Reince Priebus was running the Paul Ryan White House.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This struggle was hardly a genteel conflict of ideas. Wolff delightedly chronicles the three factions’ endless ratfucking — the leaks, the schemes, the backbiting, the outside heavies brought in to change Trump’s mind at the last minute. </p>\n<p>The conflict was so immense precisely because the president was incapable of, and uninterested in, resolving it. Trump never gave a damn about Trumpism. He’s not interested enough in policy or ideology or ideas to direct the course of his own presidency. Absent that interest, the course will be directed by the most firmly established interests around the president — in this case, the congressional GOP and his family.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Senate candidate Roy Moore \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bAXRji0QgkWKsHQkSTRY6iO9XVU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9999675/892144966.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Steve Bannon wanted to build Trumpism. He failed.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Wolff’s primary source for the book was clearly Bannon — many of the chapters proceed from his perspective, and the book ends when he leaves the White House — but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Bannon was the only senior staffer trying to craft a unique ideology out of Trump’s campaign, even if that ideology was more properly understood as Bannonism. I found this passage borderline poignant:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bannon, suffering in his internal exile, remained convinced that he represented what Donald Trump actually believed, or, more accurately, what the president felt. He knew Trump to be a fundamentally emotional man, and he was certain that the deepest part of him was angry and dark. However much the president wanted to support his daughter and her husband’s aspirations, their worldview was not his. As Walsh saw it, “Steve believes he is Darth Vader and that Trump is called to the dark side.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whether Bannon was right about Trump’s deepest impulses is immaterial. What Bannon didn’t understand was that for all his talk of “the swamp” and the power of entrenched interests and the pull of the “deep state,” if he was really going to pull off an ideological revolution in American politics, he would need a president committed to that project and the difficult work it entailed. </p>\n<p>Donald Trump was not, and is not, that president. And that’s why his presidency has, for the most part, taken the path of least resistance: outsourcing domestic policy to the congressional GOP, foreign policy to the military, and the remainder to corrupt payoffs to himself, his friends, and his family. </p>\n<h3>The mystery of Trump</h3>\n<p>Wolff’s book contains a mystery that it never resolves. </p>\n<p>“It was obvious to everyone that if [Trump] had a north star, it was just to be liked,” says Wolff. “He was ever uncomprehending about why everyone did not like him, or why it should be so difficult to get everyone to like him.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s staffers confirm the characterization. “The president fundamentally wants to be liked,” Walsh says in the book. “He just fundamentally needs to be liked so badly.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"President Donald Trump Arrives At Walter Reed National Military Medical Center\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uBcxRArQq4DldmNI6BlEsWYxnG0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9999613/896792442.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Yet it would be easy enough for Trump to run a presidency that left him better-liked. He could work with “Chuck and Nancy,” ease up on the culture war, give some gentler speeches. He’s had moments where he seemed near pivoting, where he appeared to bask in the media coverage that followed a few days of relative normalcy. There has never been a president for whom the bar is lower than Donald Trump. It would be so easy for him to clear it, and there are people around him, like Jared and Ivanka and Cohn and Powell and Mnuchin, who would happily act as guides and cheerleaders.</p>\n<p>But he doesn’t do any of it, at least not for long. Why?</p>\n<p>Wolff’s book doesn’t provide a satisfying answer. What it provides, instead, is a portrait of a man coming undone by the very forces he has unleashed. </p>\n<p>Trump doesn’t care about policy or politics or ideology or coalitions. He cares about Trump. His dream was to put his name on buildings and in tabloids, and now he has put his name on the most important building on the planet and on the front page of most every newspaper in the world. Yet the coverage he gets, outside of a few conservative outlets, is horrible, the worst of any president in memory. He cannot perform his job well enough to be liked or respected, but he only wanted the job in the first place because it would force the whole world to like and respect him — and he is being driven to rage and paranoia by the resulting dissonance, disappointment, and hurt.</p>\n<p>Imagine being Donald Trump. Imagine reading about yourself every day and knowing these awful things are being said by your friends, your aides, your allies, perhaps even your family. Imagine knowing you can’t trust anyone around you, suspecting they’re badmouthing you constantly, raising their social status by diminishing yours. </p>\n<p>Imagine seeing your stability questioned, your patriotism impugned, your intellect dismissed. Imagine doing the impossible — winning the presidency! — only to be treated as a national embarrassment. </p>\n<p>This isn’t what Trump wanted. And it’s not clear it’s something he can bear. A more capable, competent, and stable person would, by now, have either changed their behavior to receive more of the response they crave or given up on getting the response they crave. But Trump appears to exist in an unhappy middle ground, rage-tweeting through his mornings, retreating to his golf club on weekends, searching for the validation he craves in his Twitter feed and on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> but never getting it from the elite tastemakers he’s always sought to impress. </p>\n<p>The pressures of the presidency would be enough to break almost anyone, but Trump is less suited to the work, and to the backlash, than most. The strain is already showing — Trump’s workday, reportedly, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/8/16865588/report-trump-work-schedule-7-hours\">shrunk to a gentle 11 am to 6 pm</a>. But the bulk of his first term remains, and it could include his financial secrets being revealed to the world, his family being indicted, a crisis he mishandles exploding into a catastrophe. </p>\n<p>The question now — the question of Wolff’s book and of our future — is whether Trump’s staff can keep governing around him, whether a dysfunctional president can nevertheless have a semi-functional White House. </p>",

Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Jeff Flake (R-AZ)) haven’t fallen apart — yet. But they’re moving at an impossibly slow rate. After months of discussion, no one has yet put forward a bipartisan bill or even a framework, so it’s difficult to see how they’re still moving forward. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in public, the stances that the White House, Republican congressional leaders, and Democrats have taken appear irreconcilable. And Trump’s own statements have been all over the map. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics. DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems, will start “falling in love” with Republicans and their President! We are about RESULTS.</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948211438472089600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 2, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Congress has twice asked the White House what its hard-and-fast demands are on a DACA deal, and on both occasions — in October and again on Friday — the White House’s response has been a wish list constituting a comprehensive crackdown on legal and unauthorized immigration. Last week, two Republican senators <a href=\"https://www.tillis.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/1/tillis-lankford-joint-statement-on-white-house-meeting-on-daca-border-security\">accused Democrats </a>of being unwilling to make even moderate concessions on border security. </p>\n<p>The public disagreements about policy are to some extent a mirage. On Monday, two House members offered up <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/08/politics/bipartisan-daca-compromise-plan-unveiled/index.html\">yet another bipartisan DACA bill</a> — the fifth, by Vox reporter Tara Golshan’s count, that offers some vehicle to help DREAMers. If the DACA negotiations fall apart, it’s more likely to be because of disagreements about the idea of a compromise itself, or process disputes, than over the policy specifics. (And yes, that includes “the wall.”)</p>\n<p>That said, there are a<em> lot </em>of ways the talks could break down — which means, in Congress, they probably will.</p>\n<p>Here are seven things, ranked by likelihood, that could kill a DACA deal. </p>\n<h3>1) Republicans decide they don’t want it badly enough</h3>\n<p>At a certain point, someone is going to need to produce, in public, an actual policy framework that could provide the basis of a DACA deal. There will need to be something that Congress can vote on and the president can sign. </p>\n<p>And since Republicans can’t pass anything without Democratic votes in the Senate (they have 51 votes, and need 60 to overcome a filibuster) coming out only with DACA proposals that no Democrat would sign on to is tantamount to saying that they don’t actually care about a DACA fix all that much.</p>\n<p>But it’s still not clear that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16841954/daca-immigration-deal-trump-congress\">either the White House or Republican congressional leadership is interested in cutting a bipartisan deal</a>. </p>\n<p>In December, the Senate’s bipartisan working group asked Chief of Staff John Kelly to tell them what the White House would need in a DACA deal for the president to sign it. Late last week, they ostensibly got their reply: The White House sent the exact same document it had released in October, outlining an immigration “framework” that posited an overhaul of asylum laws, stepped-up interior enforcement, and a broad crackdown on legal immigration on the scale of the Trump-endorsed RAISE Act. Alongside it was a document outlining a “vision” for Trump’s border wall: 700 miles at a cost of $18 billion.</p>\n<p>Of course, the entire reason the senators asked Kelly for the White House’s demands in December was that they <em>hadn’t </em>taken the October wish list seriously. So the White House was essentially — as <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/economics/2018/01/05/democrats-angry-trump-restates-pro-american-immigration-principles/\">Breitbart correctly pointed out</a> — thumbing its nose at the idea of a bipartisan DACA deal.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"President Trump Meets With GOP Senators At The White House\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvlvPxMmvd2aT3T3zSGCkfl5Apo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10002059/886392064.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Win McNamee/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>But what made the White House’s response particularly weird was that on Thursday, staff had met with Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans — including Graham and Flake — and <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/immigration-framework-coming-next-week-senators-say-2\">struck a preliminary “deal” on DACA</a> that they would show to Democrats as early as Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The bottom line appears to be that the White House hasn’t decided it does want a deal, and pushed staff to adhere to the party line. Neither have congressional Republicans: In the House, a<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/daca-dreamers-white-house-congress-negotiations-326356\"> group of relatively conservative Republicans</a> have started their own set of DACA “discussions,” which is unlikely to result in a bill that can get Democratic votes or pass the Senate.</p>\n<p>While it’s unfair to compare the majority party to the minority party on this, it’s worth noting that Democrats, especially in the Senate, appear to be deferring to the working group and prepared to support whatever comes out of it.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean that the Republicans who <em>do </em>care about making a deal — or those who just want to avoid getting blamed when hundreds of DACA recipients a day start losing their protections when the program’s official sunset date hits in March — won’t ultimately prevail. It just means a lack of Republican will is the biggest threat right now.</p>\n<h3>2) Disagreement over attaching a DACA deal to a must-pass bill</h3>\n<p>Republican congressional leadership is pretty adamant that a DACA deal shouldn’t be attached to a government spending bill, like, for example, the one they need to pass by January 19 to keep the government open. </p>\n<p>Democrats in Congress are equally adamant that a standalone immigration bill that would legalize some unauthorized immigrants will never pass Congress — especially the House, where it would be subject to the unspoken “Hastert Rule” that bills can only be brought to the floor with the support of a majority of the Republican caucus.</p>\n<p>Depending on how the next two weeks shake out, this impasse could lead either party to walk away from DACA talks. If Republicans try to punt the January 19 deadline with another two-week continuing resolution (as they did twice in December), Democrats might refuse to go along — at which point, Republicans could pull out of the DACA talks by saying Democrats “poisoned the well.” </p>\n<p>Alternatively, if Republicans simply refuse to attach a DACA deal to a spending package, Democrats could stop trying to work with them on DACA, since they wouldn’t want to negotiate on a bill that would never pass anyway.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Schumer, Pelosi Lead Democrats' Call For GOP Lawmakers To Stand Up To President On Decision To End DACA\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qtZTijWgaPjTHi6WsD-eONiVGsU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10002065/843373720.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>This is a classic “each side blames the other” situation. Republicans would complain that Democrats simply weren’t willing to go through the legislative process the right way; Democrats would retort that they couldn’t guarantee a bill would even go to the floor if it wasn’t attached to a “must-pass” bill; Republicans would point to McConnell’s promise to bring a standalone immigration bill to the floor in January; Democrats would counter with the promises Republicans made to get Susan Collins’s vote on the tax bill, then broke within the week. </p>\n<p>The only reason this isn’t the most likely obstacle to a DACA deal is that the deal would have to make it to the “agreed-upon policy framework” level first, and, per point 1, it’s not clear they want to go that far.</p>\n<h3>3) Negotiators can’t agree on anything they can call a limit on “chain migration”</h3>\n<p>For the most part, the policy on a DACA deal is the easy part. The biggest obstacle, policy-wise, is how to satisfy the demand President Donald Trump has begun to express regularly that any deal on DACA “end chain migration.”</p>\n<p>The demand is hard to satisfy partly because it’s not clear what exactly the Trump administration is asking for — the president’s sloppy use of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/29/16504272/chain-migration-family-how-trump-end\">“chain migration”</a> implicates all family-based immigration, and the proposal he’s endorsed to “end” it, the RAISE Act, would slash legal immigration to the United States in half. It’s also a demand that’s emerged as important only in the past few weeks (months into the DACA negotiations), and one that can’t be solved just by throwing money at the problem, which is Congress’s preferred way to address specific legislative demands.</p>\n<p>But to get a bill the president will sign, negotiators have to take the demand seriously.</p>\n<p>Senators appear to be interpreting the “chain migration” demand to mean that the people who are legalized under the deal — DACA recipients and those who would have qualified for the program — will be restricted in their ability to sponsor their relatives for legal immigration to the US. </p>\n<p>There’s some disagreement about whether these restrictions would apply when the legalized immigrants were green card holders — who are already restricted in sponsoring family members — or after they were citizens. (There are concerns, and not just from Democrats, that a bill that discriminated between citizens in family sponsorship wouldn’t survive a court challenge.) </p>\n<p>But in practice, this probably wouldn’t do a ton to restrict long-term immigration to the US: Many people who would be legalized under any DACA fix have siblings who are US-born, who will be able to sponsor their parents for citizenship when they turn 21 years old.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Free Clinic Provides Immigration Assistance For Those Applying For U.S. citizenship\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFJeq_JaAUDVHgaaOg71rqBsFI4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10002091/455371772.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Joe Raedle/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>But there’s also some discussion of a more aggressive move to curb “chain migration,” targeting family visas for adult children and siblings of US citizens. These are already the lowest priorities in the immigration system, and most applicants have to wait years to get approved, but they’re also the most likely to create “chains.” </p>\n<p>If Republicans want to eliminate those categories entirely (depending on how they want to do it), Democrats — especially those members who represent Asian-American communities — may well refuse. It’s something they might be willing to do in exchange for legalizing most or all of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the US, but not for only the DREAMers — a population who, after all, Republicans claim they want to find a solution for as well.</p>\n<h3>4) A diversity visa lottery dustup</h3>\n<p>Eliminating the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/11/2/16591118/diversity-visa-explained\">diversity visa</a>, a program in which immigrants from countries that don’t send many immigrants to the US are selected by lottery and subsequently screened, is another demand the president has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/11/2/16591118/diversity-visa-explained\">lit upon in recent weeks</a> as a DACA condition — particularly since an attack in New York City by someone who came to the US on this type of visa. But it’s easier to see Democrats agreeing to go along with it, depending on what’s erected in its place.</p>\n<p>Democrats probably won’t agree to get rid of the visa lottery if those visas are simply eliminated, to result in less legal immigration overall. They might be willing to agree to reallocate the 50,000 visas issued a year by the lottery to other categories of immigrants — including, possibly, as a way to allow immigrants currently in the US on Temporary Protected Status (who can’t get green cards) to stay permanently, instead of lobbying the government to keep renewing TPS. And they could support a deal that would eliminate the “lottery” component of the diversity visa but allocate those visas to underrepresented countries by other means.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that changes to the diversity visa won’t even end up in the final deal. It would be a complicated fix, and some members of both parties are wary of using the DACA deal to make unrelated changes to legal immigration. It’s not clear, meanwhile, whether anyone is insisting on diversity visa reform as the condition for their support — except for, possibly, the White House itself.</p>\n<h3>5) That darn wall</h3>\n<p>Every time it looks like DACA talks are hitting a snag, there’s temptation to blame the wall. That happened again last week: Reports characterized the White House’s requests to Congress as a “demand” of $18 billion in wall funding in exchange for a DACA deal, or as holding DREAMers “hostage” to get money for the wall.</p>\n<p>But the Democratic aide who told Politico that the White House’s border vision was “far beyond the bounds of what any Democrat or Republican has been discussing” was correct. It’s not clear that Republicans in Congress are willing to spend $18 billion on a wall, much less that they’d demand it as a condition on DACA. </p>\n<p>For that matter, it’s not even clear that the White House is making it a demand. The document was sent to Congress in response to a request from senators for the White House to articulate what it actually needed in a deal — but it was sent alongside the exact same “framework” the White House issued in October, which wasn’t taken as a serious starting point in negotiations at the time. And one of the people who first reported on the existence of the document, the Wall Street Journal’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurameckler/status/949264753590927361\">Laura Meckler</a>, specified that it was “not clear Trump [was] demanding [the] whole thing” in a DACA deal.</p>\n<p>To the extent that the $18 billion document throws a wrench in DACA negotiations, it’s because it illustrates the first problem above: that it’s not clear the White House is interested in making a deal that involves getting anything less than its entire immigration wish list.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlhVvw-oWhAgN4WKyri-tLiiAOk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7976549/pedestrian_fence_photo_vox.jpg\">\n<cite>US Customs and Border Protection</cite>\n<figcaption>Fence, or wall?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Within Congress, the two parties seem much closer to each other than either does to the White House.</p>\n<p>The numbers floated by two Republican senators, North Carolina’s Thom Tillis and Oklahoma’s James Lankford, on Thursday were much more modest: $1.6 billion to build 76 miles of border barriers. (Tillis and Lankford claimed even that wasn’t acceptable to Democrats, and that they’ve walked away from the Senate working group because of Democrats’ border demands — but other reports indicate that Tillis and Lankford were basically kicked out of the group, so it’s not clear whether they are characterizing that correctly.)</p>\n<p>If the White House’s actual demands match Tillis and Lankford’s — or if it can be talked into demanding something closer to theirs — the hardest part will be the messaging: Trump will have to be able to claim it is a border wall, while Democrats claim it isn’t. </p>\n<p>But given that the White House has been known to claim, when convenient, that any physical barrier on the border is a “wall,” this doesn’t seem that difficult. It’s still very hard to imagine that Democrats will pass on the opportunity to allow hundreds of thousands, or more, unauthorized immigrants to become citizens, if the alternative is splitting a linguistic hair over what exactly the meaning of “wall” is.</p>\n<h3>6) Republicans decide they want some new enforcement trade-off</h3>\n<p>So far in negotiations, Republican leadership has been unwilling to make any public distinctions between what they really need and what they’d like to have. So it’s possible that McConnell, or Ryan, or Trump could decide that some other immigration enforcement measure is a condition for their vote. Restrictions on asylum claims? Interior enforcement? Increasing mandatory minimums for illegal reentry? There are lots of options; it’s just not clear that any of them is all that important.</p>\n<h3>7) The actual part of a DACA deal dealing with DACA recipients </h3>\n<p>Past immigration debates have focused on the minutiae of how unauthorized immigrants would be able to apply for legal status, how many of them would be eligible, and what their ultimate status would be. This immigration debate really has not — perhaps because the entire reason to make a DACA deal would be to address the fact that an overwhelming majority of Americans think DREAMers should have legal status.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Young Immigrants Apply For Obama Administration's Temporary Deportation Reprieve\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5iD2Be6HTz7-f_EbElGtFBk0KY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10002199/150318918.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Members of Congress appear to be in agreement that they want to strike a balance between <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/5/16256376/dream-act-rac-daca-bridge\">two DACA legalization bills already proposed</a>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>The DREAM Act, co-sponsored by Democrats and a few Republicans</li>\n<li>The SUCCEED Act backed by more conservative Republicans</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Those two bills aren’t all that far apart to begin with: They differ mostly in how long people would be in provisional status before being eligible to apply for green cards, and the SUCCEED Act has stricter eligibility requirements in some regards. </p>\n<p>Any hybrid of the two would almost certainly allow <em>more </em>immigrants to legalize than were protected over DACA: It would apply not only to people who have DACA now or had it in the past, but also to those who would have qualified, or who are currently too young but would have qualified once they turned 15.</p>\n<p>The only politician who’s expressed opinions about who should be legalized and how is Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who told a reporter Tuesday that she didn’t think children should be eligible for legalization — a strange position, since most politicians are sympathetic to the idea of “DACA kids.” But Nielsen doesn’t even appear to be in the room for negotiations. And the president, who continues to promise excellent “results” for DACA recipients, is probably not going to pore over the legalization details of a bill sitting on his desk.</p>",

They’ve argued the case on a number of fronts, from federalism and states’ rights to rapid changes in public opinion to the need for individual privacy. </p>\n<p>Last week, the Trump administration outlined a change that could potentially signal an oncoming crackdown. </p>\n<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16849866/marijuana-legalization-trump-sessions-cole-memo\">announced</a> on Wednesday that the administration would withdraw the Cole Memo,<strong> </strong>which provided some protection for state-level marijuana businesses from federal intervention, and other guidance related to marijuana policy. Advocates predict it will set back their movement, but the full implications of the changes aren’t known yet. In some respects, the move isn’t a total surprise, given Sessions’s longtime opposition to marijuana legalization, which <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/jeff-sessions-coming-war-on-legal-marijuana-214501\">worried advocates</a> as soon as he was nominated to run the DOJ. </p>\n<p>“Even if it’s not out of line with what [marijuana] advocates saw coming, it’s still a step in precisely the wrong direction,” Robby Soave, associate editor at Reason Magazine, a libertarian publication based in Washington, DC, told me. </p>\n<p>“It’s remarkable: This is an open-and-shut issue for liberals, for libertarians, for young people, even for a lot of conservatives and Trump voters. They may not all like weed, but they are coming around to the position that banning it isn’t worth the effort, and in any case, this should be up to the states. Sessions’s crusade against drugs is quixotic and out of step with this.” </p>\n<p>Sessions’s decision represents a fundamental question about the Trump administration and its approach to policymaking: How do we know what President Trump really believes — and, more importantly, what he will make into a concrete strategy? On the campaign trail, Trump outlined a number of left-leaning policy preferences — from keeping Medicaid in place to repeatedly stating his support for efforts to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/feb/28/gavin-newsom/true-campaign-trump-said-states-should-decide-lega/\">leave marijuana policy to the states</a>. But in office, he’s put in place Cabinet officials who want to implement the very opposite, much to the disappointment of many within his own party. </p>\n<p>For many, the move from Sessions and the Justice Department is at best frustrating and worst an outright betrayal, especially for libertarians and conservatives who think a federal crackdown on a substance a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/25/poll-americans-support-marijuana-legalization-244155\">majority of Republicans support legalizing</a> is a massive step backward, and that marijuana can be the issue to get liberals on the side of federalism and the power of state government. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/06/jeff-sessions-marijuana-legalization-congress-216251\">promised</a> to block all Justice Department nominations until he receives confirmation that Colorado’s marijuana policy will be able to stay in place — and he’s the chair of the National Republican Senate Committee. </p>\n<h3>For conservatives and libertarians, marijuana can be a complicated issue</h3>\n<p>Marijuana policy has become a complex touchstone for conservatives, especially in the post-Obama era. </p>\n<p>Many feel, for example, that Barack Obama’s handling of the issue of marijuana decriminalization represented his abuse of executive action. Obama used executive orders and memos (like the Cole Memo) to discourage the Department of Justice and FBI from taking action against state-level marijuana growers, dispensaries, and users, recognizing that the disparities between public opinion, state law, and federal policy.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/president-obama-marijuana-users-high-priority-drug-war/story?id=17946783\">He told NBC in 2012</a>, “This is a tough problem, because Congress has not yet changed the law. I head up the executive branch; we’re supposed to be carrying out laws. And so what we’re going to need to have is a conversation about, How do you reconcile a federal law that still says marijuana is a federal offense and state laws that say that it’s legal?”</p>\n<p>As David French <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/455147/marijuana-decriminalization-congress-must-act\">argued</a> in National Review on Thursday, Sessions’s actions are “a restoration of the rule of law and the end of yet another unconstitutional Obama policy that privileged executive power over the American constitutional structure.” </p>\n<p>Still, many conservatives agree with the policy itself for a variety of reasons. </p>\n<p>French states in the very same piece that marijuana should be decriminalized, full stop, through legislation introduced in Congress. “Simply put, we need fewer criminal statutes and fewer prisoners.” </p>\n<p>To many Republicans, marijuana is a state-level issue that should be handled by state-level legislation — and voters. As conservative commentator Erick Erickson <a href=\"https://www.themaven.net/theresurgent/erick-erickson/marijuana-and-the-rule-of-law-g7dM5r6vKUO41DUxtIj0qA?utm_content=buffer55689&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&full=1\">wrote recently</a>, “The solution here is not to ignore the federal law, but to repeal it. To do otherwise empowers individuals beyond the rule of law and puts the whims of officials ahead of the will of the people.” </p>\n<h3>“People on the left should be aware that their state-level priorities can be overwritten”</h3>\n<p>I spoke with Charles C.W. Cooke, editor of National Review Online, about conservative views on marijuana policy. He said that Jeff Sessions as attorney general should make it clear that relying on the federal government has its drawbacks. </p>\n<p>“People on the left should be aware that their state-level priorities can be overwritten, much as conservatives can have their state-level priorities overwritten,” he said. In short, the same federal government that could, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-administration-will-no-longer-defend-doma/\">refuse to defend the Defense of Marriage Act</a> in court in 2011 could also raid law-abiding marijuana dispensaries in Aspen, Colorado, in 2018. </p>\n<p>Cooke added that he found it strange how many Republicans who decry expensive federal programs and the intervention of big government into the private lives of everyday citizens had stayed silent on the war on drugs. </p>\n<p>“This is a large government program. It hasn’t worked. Most people can see that marijuana is not in any meaningful way prohibited,” he said. </p>\n<p>He pointed to the success of programs in Oregon and California, where anti-reformers’ worst fears haven’t come to pass. </p>\n<p>“I see conservatives’ greatest contribution to American politics as being their willingness to step in where programs are not working and say so,” he said. “Whether that’s gun control or welfare or high taxes, they’ve often fought those fights. And yet for some reason when it comes to drugs, about half the party doesn’t.” </p>",

The interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950103659337134080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>The whole spectacle is emblematic of Trump’s unusual relationship to the news media. </p>\n<p>All presidents complain, to some extent, about the press coverage they receive. But none of Trump’s predecessors have been even remotely in the neighborhood of this aggressive in his denunciations of the press and his overt hostility to mainstream journalistic institutions. </p>\n<p>The press has responded with an attitude of righteous indignation, skewering the White House (rightly) for an unprecedented volume of dishonesty and generating a ton of compulsively readable copy. But by the same token, in a concrete financial sense, Trump is one of the best things that’s happened to the media in years — generating a steady stream of audience interest in his antics and doling out a reliable stream of in-person and social media chum for journalists to swarm over. And while Trump really has followed through on his promises to dole out <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/8/16862898/trump-tps-salvador-ms13-immigrants\">harsh treatment to immigrants</a>, none of his threatened legal actions against reporters have actually come to pass. </p>\n<p>What Trump enjoys is a political pretense of a war with the press. Meanwhile, the business operations of the press have used the pretense of conflict with the Trump administration as a gimmick. But the whole conflict has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe\"><strong>kayfabe</strong></a> aspect to it, in which the appearance of a feud is entertaining for the audience and mutually beneficial to the practitioners.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h3>The media uses Trump as a marketing tool</h3>\n<p>What’s particularly striking about Trump’s relationship with the mainstream press is the extent to which the pretense of an oppositional relationship with the White House has become a marketing tool. </p>\n<p>All of these institutions, from the Washington Post to CNN, have a real interest in rigorous journalism — as their actual reporting clearly shows. </p>\n<p>But their explicit marketing around the White House is undeniable. </p>\n<p>CNN’s “facts first” branding campaign, rolled out last fall, was pitched to the press as an effort to <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/watch-in-the-face-of-trump-attacks-cnn-launches-new-marketing-campaign/345818\">“blunt Trump attacks”</a> on the network, but the reference to Kellyanne Conway’s infamous alternative facts gaffe belies the fact that CNN isn’t so much countering Trump’s anti-CNN rhetoric as feasting off it.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDI5ggRcqW1FmUnixBNDtgCWazs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9983261/FACTS_FIRST.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>The Washington Post, similarly, newly adopted the slogan “Democracy Dies in Darkness” last year, pitching reading the Post not only as a way to be informed or entertained but also as a form of civic duty and obligation. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPy58t3DVXXV6-56PGg1wGKkeyM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9983299/Screen_Shot_2017_04_05_at_1.40.26_PM.png.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>The New York Times, a for-profit, publicly traded company, last year began soliciting money from readers with a quasi-charitable pitch, emphasizing the idea that buying gift subscriptions is a means of supporting the company’s “mission.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8eMfxM_-rUFw4nSLsFOCdimQdg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9983307/Screen_Shot_2017_04_05_at_1.37.49_PM.png.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>The marketing pitches underscore that in concrete dollars-and-cents terms, Trump has been very good to the mainstream news media — driving clicks, ratings, and subscriptions at a time when the broader economics of the industry have grown difficult, due to Facebook and Google hoovering up a rising share of advertising revenue. </p>\n<h3>Trump’s war on the media hasn’t materialized</h3>\n<p>In this context, it’s worth noting that once upon a time, Trump seemed to genuinely threaten a crackdown on press freedoms. </p>\n<p>He spoke of a desire to “open up” libel laws, and threatened <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/13/11669850/donald-trump-threatens-amazon\">regulatory retaliation against Amazon for Post articles he didn’t like</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/donald-trump-lawsuit-threat.html\">lawsuits against the Times</a>. There are very real things that a president could at least <em>try</em> to do to coerce media outlets into delivering favorable coverage. Lyndon Johnson, for example, <a href=\"http://www.houstonpress.com/news/lbj-and-the-houston-chronicle-papers-support-signed-sealed-and-delivered-6737908\">appears to have used a proposed bank merger</a> as leverage with the owner of the Houston Chronicle to gain the Texas newspaper’s support for his legislative agenda. </p>\n<p>But Trump does not appear to be doing any of these things. There is no indication that his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, has any unusual opinions on the First Amendment’s limitations on libel lawsuits. The regulators he has thus far appointed seem to be very conventional pro-business Republicans who are inclined to make business-friendly rulings without a lot of interest in disciplining companies for editorial content. Trump, for example, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/4/15167544/broadband-privacy-poll\">signed a very unpopular bill rolling back broadband privacy regulations</a> rather than using it as leverage to try to get Comcast to deliver more Trump-friendly coverage on NBC properties. </p>\n<p>Trump has idly threatened Michael Wolff with a civil lawsuit to block the publication of his dishy exposé of the Trump White House’s first year, but actually has not thus far matched either the George W. Bush or Barack Obama administrations in terms of concrete legal action against journalists. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump's attempt to quash publication of a book is heinous. Remember too that the GW Bush and Obama Justice Departments went after Jim Risen and his book with a passion, actually threatening Risen with jail if he did not flip on a source. <a href=\"https://t.co/jt39GEcEmd\">https://t.co/jt39GEcEmd</a></p>— jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/949326181710618624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Indeed, the reality is that Trump’s attacks on Wolff’s <em>Fire and Fury</em> have been the greatest marketing coup the book’s publisher could possibly have hoped for. Meanwhile, Trump continues to at least sporadically dole out exclusive interviews to various outlets — including the New York Times — during which journalists generally ask him rather relaxed softball questions in the knowledge that simply getting the president talking makes for good copy.</p>\n<p>Trump’s December 28 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-excerpts.html\">interview with the NYT’s Michael Schmidt</a> was fairly typical of the genre. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/29/16829806/trump-interview-new-york-times\">Vox’s Ezra Klein and many other Trump critics</a> viewed it as discrediting, revealing once again the president’s shallow understanding of the issues and his constitutional responsibilities. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/time-at-mar-a-lago-is-a-respite-for-trump--and-a-headache-for-his-staff/2017/12/29/c1c3764a-ecb1-11e7-b698-91d4e35920a3_story.html?utm_term=.1c5595a57fc4\">according to the Washington Post, Trump himself was pleased with the results</a>, and he “enjoyed the coverage afterward and noted that it dominated TV most of Friday.” </p>\n<h3>The media is a convenient foil for Trump</h3>\n<p>Sparring with the press is useful for Trump in part because it tends to drive media coverage of him, which to an extent he sees as its own reward. Dating back to <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, Trump has frequently espoused a “no such thing as bad publicity” theory of media relations, and that tactic served him extremely well in the Republican Party presidential primary when press attention was a genuinely scarce resource amid a crowded field. </p>\n<p>It’s doubtful that the same approach was genuinely advantageous to him during the general election against Hillary Clinton, but the fact is that he won when almost everyone (myself included) expected him to lose — so it’s hardly surprising that Trump is inclined to stick with the tactics that brought him to where he is today. </p>\n<p>But more broadly, to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/01/27/donald-trump-media-opposition-party-sot-nr.cnn\">cast the press as the real “opposition party” in America</a> — as Trump has — offers some meaningful tactical advantages. Trump, in an unusual way, won the 2016 presidential election without being popular. Not only did he win fewer votes than Hillary Clinton on Election Day, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/18/16305486/what-really-happened-in-2016\">his favorability rating was lower than that</a> of the <em>losing</em> candidates from the 2012, 2008, 2004, and 2000 presidential elections. </p>\n<p>The nonpartisan press can (and does) report facts that are unflattering to Trump. But a lack of unflattering facts or a failure by the public to appreciate their existence has never been the foundation of Trump’s political success. And the press <em>isn’t</em> going to do the work of an actual opposition party, which is to formulate a political alternative that an adequate number of people find to be sufficiently inspiring to go out and vote for. That’s the job of the Democratic Party, an institution that’s had considerable trouble attracting press attention to its own message and ideas ever since Trump exploded on the scene. And keeping the media focused on a self-referential feud between Trump and the media is a way of maintaining his preferred approach of trying to suck up all the oxygen in the room.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, what matters to Trump isn’t any actual crushing of the media, but simply driving the narrative in his core followers’ heads that the media is at war with him. With that pretense in place, critical coverage and unflattering facts can be dismissed even as Trump selectively courts the press to inject his own preferred ideas into the mainstream. </p>",

Here’s what it told me.</p> <p>Americans have preconceptions of what North Korea is like — militant, reclusive, and oppressive. But we don’t really understand what North Korea’s vision of America is. How do they view our government, our policies, and our history?</p>\n<p>One way to answer this lies in the propaganda that shapes public opinion in North Korea. In the closed, authoritarian society, the regime is the only consistent source of information for the public. </p>\n<p>As it happens, I recently acquired a very real North Korea propaganda book, authored by three state-sanctioned North Korean academics. Titled <em>The US Imperialists Started the Korean War</em>, the book is a sweeping indictment of American aggression, arguing that the US provoked the Korean War in the 1950s as part of a much broader strategy of post-WWII global domination. </p>\n<p>That war pitted communist North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and later China, against South Korea, backed by the United States. It started when the North invaded the South on June 25, 1950. It was a bloody war that ultimately killed some <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war\">five million soldiers and civilians</a>. At the war’s end in 1953, the two countries became separated by a demilitarized zone, or DMZ, and remain so to this day.</p>\n<p>The book’s prose is awful and the claims are wildly overstated, but it offers a revealing look at how US foreign policy is perceived from the perspective of the North Korean regime — and North Korean citizens, who are fed this propaganda. </p>\n<p>Much of it is false, some of it is true, and deciding which is which is not as easy as you might expect. </p>\n<p>Still, I decided to do a mock interview with this North Korean propaganda book. I drafted questions and paired them with lightly edited passages from the text. Since it wasn’t a real conversation, there is no back-and-forth. Nor is there any attempt to analyze the arguments. </p>\n<p>The point is to hear the story North Koreans tell themselves about America, however true or false it may be. If nothing else, it explains why so many North Koreans are convinced that America is the most evil country in the world.</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, here is my fake interview with a very real North Korea propaganda book.</p>\n<p><em>[Author’s note: </em><em>A</em><em>gain, this is NOT a real interview, but the a</em><em>nswers to my questions</em><em> are plucked directly from the book and edited only slightly to increase clarity.]</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>You claim that the Korean War was the result of American imperialist aggression. What happened?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>The US imperialists were absorbed in searching for a way to occupy Korea without shedding blood, and intended to seize by any means even part of the Korean peninsula, if not all, and to use it as a springboard for their future continental aggression. From this crafty design of the US ruling circles sprang the plan for the “bloodless occupation” of Korea.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What was America’s “bloodless occupation” plan?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>They considered that in order to occupy one part of Korea without the least bloodshed they should check the communists’ advance into Korea at a definite point and provide guarantee for this by a certain international agreement. </p>\n<p>On this calculation, they adopted a criminal plan, that is, to divide Korea into north and south and prevent her people from liberating their country through their own efforts.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What was America’s goal in South Korea?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>To check the South Korean people’s struggle to build a new society and to create conditions favorable for the US occupation of South Korea and its establishment of colonial rule.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Why do you consider America’s occupation of South Korea the “greatest national misfortune” in the history of the Korean Peninsula?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>It was the root cause of a calamity of territorial bisection and national division which the Korean people had never experienced during their long history of 5,000 years. It gave rise to a hotbed of a new war in Korea, and the US imperialist policy of turning South Korea into a military base entered the stage of full-scale realization. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“In the Korean war the US imperialists, who had long been trained on misanthropy and racism, revealed their barbarity and brutality to the whole world.”</q></aside></div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Is it really the case that America “enslaved” South Korea?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>From the first day of their occupation of South Korea, the US imperialists followed colonial enslavement and military base policies. In fact, all the policies adopted by US imperialism were, without exception, related to its aggressive design to convert South Korea into a colonial military base and use it as a stepping-stone for the conquest of the whole of Korea.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>But why conquer the whole of Korea? What was America’s broader aim?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>The trend of revolutionary developments to peace and democracy, national independence and socialism constituted a fatal blow to the aggressive policy of world domination pursued by the US imperialists who had called for “global supremacy” immediately after WWII.</p>\n<p>Greatly alarmed by the growth of revolutionary forces, they resorted to the policy of cold war in an attempt to find a way out of the impasse and launched an all-out reactionary offensive for world domination.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/record-war.html\">US leaders claimed</a><strong> </strong>in the years leading up to the Korean War that America should not expand its involvement in South Korea and Taiwan. Was that just a lie or did events on the ground change?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>They formed some designs to veil their aggressive nature and lay blame for war at the [North Korea’s] door. The first design was to convince the world of the fact that Korea’s security had nothing to do with US security and that the US was not interested in Korea ... but a gimlet in a bag shows itself. </p>\n<p>The hypocritical nature of their statements soon came into the open. They were an anesthetic to benumb the vigilance of the world public, the Korean and Chinese peoples in particular, over the US war policy and a smokescreen to cover up their war provocation plan. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What was the smokescreen? How did the US justify its desired war with North Korea?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>The war plan was occasioned by two causes: one was the political and economic crisis of the Syngman Rhee government [Rhee was the US-backed president of South Korea from 1948 to 1960] on the verge of total collapse, and the other was the imminency of liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese people.</p>\n<div><aside><q>“The US aggressors, as befitting such brutal nature of fascist hangmen, committed atrocities of mass slaughter against the Korean people from the first days of war.”</q></aside></div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What was the “political and economic crisis” in South Korea and how did it provide the US with an opportunity to attack North Korea?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>The South Korean economy which had rushed along the road of ruin under the US military administration entered a graver stage from 1949. Production was totally destroyed and the currency inflation was uncontrollable. Economic ruin directly affected the people’s life, roused the broader masses to an anti-US, national salvation struggle, and thus aggravated the political crisis of the Syngman Rhee government.</p>\n<p>The only outlet for him [Rhee] was to ignite a war as soon as possible. Driven to the wall, Rhee came to the conclusion that war alone could get him out of the precipice and clear away all the political and economic crises. Thus he hurriedly sent M. Chang [the South Korean ambassador] to Washington who reported the “ruinous state of the government” to the US master and asked for “urgent US aid” to overcome that crisis.</p>\n<p>Having received the urgent message from Rhee, President Truman, who had no other way but to back Rhee, as he had put it himself, now had to check the fall of the Rhee government and, to this end, he had to quickly enkindle a planned war.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>Once the war began, you say the US committed “mass atrocities” with “American-style brutality and and inhumanity.” Care to explain?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>The US aggressors, as befitting such brutal nature of fascist hangmen, committed atrocities of mass slaughter against the Korean people from the first days of war ... </p>\n<p>Even according to the data confirmed by the initial investigation, the US aggressors murdered innumerable patriots and other people in large and small towns and villages of South Korea — 1,146 in Suwon, over 2,060 in Chungju, more than 600 in Kongju and Phyongthaek respectively, over 2,000 in Puyo and Chongju respectively, 8,644 in Taejon, over 4,000 in Jonju, more than 500 in Ansong, over 400 in Kunsan and Anyang respectively, 158 in Jochiwon and more than 800 in Thongyong, to cite some examples.</p>\n<div> <figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fvd9HcUYazu7HcXZt-BFyE_OQmg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9984173/18006774._UY444_SS444_.jpg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>You’re citing casualty numbers, but isn’t it the nature of war that people are killed? What’s uniquely cruel or unjust about this?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>In the Korean war the US imperialists, who had long been trained on misanthropy and racism, revealed their barbarity and brutality to the whole world, far exceeding those of the preceding imperialists.</p>\n<p>“Retake Seoul! There are girls and women. For three days the city will be yours. You will have girls and women in Seoul.” This is the special order MacArthur, Commander of the UN Forces, issued in September 1950 to US men and officers making a landing at Inchon. As seen in this “special order” of MacArthur, the US imperialists did not hesitate to throw off their masks of so-called “civilization” and “humanism” and reveal their wolfish nature in order to retrieve themselves from their defeat in the Korean war.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>And yet despite all these tactics you accuse the US of employing, you claim that they lost anyway. </p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>The US imperialists schemed to bring the Korean people to their knees and nip the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea since 1948] in the bud, employing every available brutal method defying the imagination. </p>\n<p>But the US war zealots made a grave mistake in their calculation and eventually met with an ignominious defeat at the hands of the Korean people. Having suffered a serious military, political and moral defeat in the Korean war, the US imperialists began sliding downhill for the first time in US history to explode the myth about their “mightiness.” </p>\n<p>But imperialists do not by nature draw a lesson from their defeat. Far from learning a due lesson from history, from their miserable defeat in the Korean war, the US imperialists have pursed the policy of aggression and war ever since the conclusion of the Armistice Agreement in their desperate effort to save themselves from sliding downhill.</p>\n<div><aside><q>“The US imperialists schemed to bring the Korean people to their knees and nip the DPRK in the bud, employing every available brutal method defying the imagination.”</q></aside></div>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What does that “policy of aggression and war” look like today?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>In pursuing the policy of aggression on Korea under their postwar “strategy of mass reprisal” based on the “policy of strength,” the US imperialists laid stress on their permanent occupation of South Korea while hampering Korea’s reunification, fortified South Korea as their military strategic base by extensively reinforcing the puppet armed forces, and at the same time lined up the South Korean puppets with the Japanese militarists and sped up preparations for a new war for the occupation of the whole of Korea. </p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>And what role has the North Korean government played in all this?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>All these incidents which the whole world had watched with deep apprehensions could be brought under control and prevented from developing into a big war only thanks to the persistent peace policy of the Government of the DPRK. </p>\n<p>Ever since liberation the DPRK Government has invariably held that Korea must be relieved from tension and the question of her reunification be solved peacefully, not by war. It proposed to solve the question of national reunification independently and peacefully on a democratic principle more than 150 times. </p>\n<p>But the US imperialists doggedly cling to their policy of of aggression and war ... The tense situation and the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula are an outcome of US policy.</p>\n<h4>Sean Illing</h4>\n<p>What happens next?</p>\n<h4>North Korea Propaganda Book</h4>\n<p>If the US imperialists, oblivious of the lessons of history, are tenacious enough to provoke a new war of aggression in Korea, turning a deaf ear to the just demand of the Korean people and going against the current of the times, they will eventually perish in the flames of war once and for all, suffering a still greater, miserable defeat than they suffered in the past Korean war.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

That’s 0.1 percent of the price of the tax overhaul.</p> <p>The Children’s Health Insurance Program is a cheap, successful program that provides health care coverage to 9 million low- and middle-income children. Its budget expired 101 days ago — and Republicans in Congress have done next to nothing about it. </p>\n<p>Multiple states have sent out letters warning families that their kids’ health insurance could end on January 31. Congress did pass a temporary bill that it expected to extend CHIP’s life span until March — but it turns out they got the math wrong, and states may run out of funding as early as January 19. Eleven days from now.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Congress managed to pass a tax bill along party lines that will give about $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to corporations and the very wealthy. How did they pay for it? They didn’t. The cost is piled onto the <a href=\"http://file:///Users/sarahkliff/Downloads/x-67-17.pdf\">deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>Democrats and Republicans have agreed, in principle, on a plan to reauthorize CHIP’s funding for five years. But Republicans proposed a series of deeply partisan spending cuts to cover the costs of extending CHIP — such as slashing Obamacare programs and Medicare — that have stalled negotiations.</p>\n<p>States are having very real discussions about the possibility that the 20-year-old program will shut down. If it does, the kids on CHIP don’t have a safety net. The CHIP program <em>is </em>their safety net. Time is running out, and Congress is doing nothing. </p>\n<h3>Republicans have displayed stunning hypocrisy </h3>\n<p>Republicans in Congress have said that extending CHIP costs too much. At the time, the estimated cost was $8 billion — and it has since dropped to $800 million.</p>\n<p>“The reason CHIP is having trouble [passing] is because we don’t have money anymore,” Sen. Orrin <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/11/30/1719944/-Hatch-leading-the-fight-for-1-5-trillion-deficit-boosting-tax-cuts-says-we-can-t-afford-CHIP\">Hatch (R-UT), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said in early December</a>. “We just add more and more spending and more and more spending, and you can look at the rest of the bill for the more and more spending.”</p>\n<p>But just days after Hatch said this, Republicans passed tax cuts worth $1.5 trillion that aren’t paid for at all. Instead, they piled the cost onto the federal deficit by more than a trillion dollars. The price of extending CHIP is 0.1 percent of the cost of the tax bill.</p>\n<p>When it comes to extending tax cuts to wealthy Americans and corporations, there’s apparently no need to find a way to pay for it. The money is just there, even if it means going into debt. When it comes to giving kids health insurance, the calculus is the opposite. </p>\n<h3>Covering kids is really cheap </h3>\n<p>Buying kids health insurance is, in terms of federal budgeting, quite cheap. Unlike Medicare enrollees — who are significantly closer to the end of life and require more intensive care — CHIP beneficiaries tend to have relatively low per-person spending. </p>\n<p>Up until a few weeks ago, the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $8 billion to extend the program for five years. But more recently, on Friday, CHIP’s price tag has fallen even further, to just $800 million for the next five years, or an average of $160 million per year. </p>\n<p>(The reasons for this are a bit wonky, but for those who want the details: The new CBO report takes into account the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill. That is expected to significantly raise premiums in the Obamacare marketplace. Since some CHIP children are expected to transfer to the marketplace for coverage should their plans disappear, CBO expects the federal government would have to spend significantly more to subsidize those now-higher premiums). </p>\n<p>CHIP was always a relatively cheap program for the federal government. But $160 million per year is a drop in the bucket when it comes to the $3.7 trillion federal budget. It is equivalent to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/f-35-price-expected-to-drop-to-about-80-million-per-plane-by-fiscal-2019/article/2615020\">two military aircraft</a> currently on order. </p>\n<p>It is a fraction of the price of the many tax cuts in the newly passed Republican bill, which is expected to raise the deficit by $1.5 trillion:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/291rduyuNg086prCZrsyR7qnBG0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998345/CHIP_VS_TAX2.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>Another way to think about the price of CHIP is to compare it to the price of building President Trump’s proposed border wall, which the administration now estimates would cost $18 billion. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8UHhPgV4OWq1kehfDN5ZWBoiohc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998493/CHIP_VS_Wall.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>Again, CHIP comes in at a small fraction of the cost of building a border wall — 4.4 percent, to be exact.</p>\n<h3>CHIP has cut kids’ uninsured rate in half over the past two decades</h3>\n<p>The CHIP program has done what it’s supposed to do since it began 20 years ago: It has dramatically reduced the number of kids who go without health insurance and increased their access to medical services, all at a relatively low price.</p>\n<p>Before Congress created CHIP, 14 percent of American children simply went without health insurance. Two decades ago, in 1997, Congress decided this was unacceptable. Republicans and Democrats teamed up to create the program and provide coverage to low- and middle-income children. </p>\n<p>The program, quite simply, worked. States quickly saw results. <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/6/e697.long\">One study</a> of the impact of CHIP in New York “showed that pre-existing racial/ethnic disparities in access, unmet need, and continuity of care among children were virtually eliminated during the year following their enrollment in CHIP,” the Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-impact-of-the-childrens-health-insurance-program-chip-issue-brief/\">notes</a>.</p>\n<p>Nationally, kids’ uninsured rate has fallen in half since Congress created CHIP (and further since the Affordable Care Act took effect). This has all happened while uninsured rates for adults has remained much higher.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSVkxSPAk6RKCeL2QJ3CYYGz4iI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9995587/8570_figure_11.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>Kids on CHIP are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955282/\">more likely</a> to go to the dentist than those who are uninsured. They are <a href=\"https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Contractor-Report-No_1.pdf\">less likely</a> to have unmet needs for necessary medical services, like getting prescription eyeglasses or mental health counseling. </p>\n<p>One recent government evaluation of CHIP found that kids on CHIP tend to have access to care that is roughly equivalent to that of kids who are on private, employer-sponsored coverage through their parents. And “compared to uninsured children, children enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP have substantially better access to health care services,” the <a href=\"https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Contractor-Report-No_1.pdf\">same report found</a>. </p>\n<p>But now all of this progress is at risk. CHIP programs have so far subsisted on money left over from their last round of budgeting five years ago. That won’t last. </p>\n<p>Congress can fix this problem. If Republicans and Democrats can get together like they did in 1997, they could pass a five-year extension of the program, spend $800 million, and put these families’ worries at ease.

Is that changing?</p> <p>A series of recent news stories raise questions about how much longer the main US federal law enforcement bodies can hold out against Trump’s authoritarian instincts when it comes to rule of law.</p>\n<p>Just last week, we learned both that the Justice Department was reexamining the Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13500018/clinton-email-scandal-bullshit\">email case</a>, and that the FBI had revived a dormant investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/11/17/16658080/uranium-one-clinton-russia-chart\">Clinton Foundation</a>. The Trump administration installed its own appointees to several important US attorney posts without getting the Senate’s approval, and has recently sidelined several career officials in the FBI or DOJ who Trump dislikes.</p>\n<p>On top of that, two Republican senators referred the author of the “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16845704/steele-dossier-russia-trump\">Steele dossier</a>,” which claimed collusion between Trump and Russia, to the Justice Department for potential criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that there are reasonable explanations for each of these moves. For instance, the new investigations and the criminal referral could be based on legitimate evidence, or they could end up not resulting in any action at all. Perhaps Trump’s new appointees could prove to be defenders of the Justice Department’s independence. </p>\n<p>But when viewed in the context of Trump’s many public demands that his political and even bureaucratic opponents be investigated and charged with crimes — and his already-known efforts to interfere with Justice Department investigations — all this makes for a disturbing pattern.</p>\n<p>“Many people in our Country are asking what the ‘Justice’ Department” is going to do about “Crooked Hillary,” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937142713211813889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">tweeted in December</a>. The department “must finally act” against former FBI Director James Comey and former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/948174033882927104\">tweeted last week</a>. And in November, he asserted that the Democratic Party had violated “campaign finance laws and money laundering” during its 2016 primary, and asked, “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/926249604936556545\">Where is our Justice Department?”</a></p>\n<p>Throughout most of Donald Trump’s first year in office, his efforts to bend the law enforcement agencies of the United States to his will seemed to fail — seemingly demonstrating the resilience of American institutions against a president with authoritarian instincts. When he fired Comey, he only ended up with special counsel Robert Mueller. His repeated public demands for the FBI and Justice Department to investigate his political opponents seemed to be falling on deaf ears. </p>\n<p>But the big question in the coming year is whether Trump will succeed in demolishing the norm of Justice Department independence and at contorting the rule of law to better advance his own political interests. Here are five recent stories that show troubling signs on that front.</p>\n<h3>1) The Justice Department is looking into Hillary Clinton’s emails again</h3>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/justice-department-looking-into-hillary-clintons-emails-again\">report by the Daily Beast’s Betsy Woodruff,</a> DOJ officials have launched an effort to “gather new details on how Clinton and her aides handled classified material” while she was secretary of State. They are reexamining both the facts of the email case, and investigative decisions made by officials during Obama’s administration.</p>\n<p>This is worrying because the case was closed, and because Trump has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937142713211813889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">repeatedly demanded</a>, in tweets and public statements, that the Justice Department investigate Clinton (and criticized the decision not to prosecute Clinton on the email issue in particular). The department has a tradition and norm of making its investigative and prosecutorial decisions without presidential interference, particularly in highly charged political cases. Additionally, the Justice Department’s inspector general was already reviewing the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case.</p>\n<p>Now, former Clinton campaign spokesperson (and Justice Department spokesperson) Brian Fallon isn’t ready to panic just yet. Fallon told Woodruff that he thinks this is probably just an effort “to give Trump and his allies something to talk about and point to, and something to give Fox News to devote segments to,” rather than a serious effort aimed at prosecution. Still, he warns that even doing that is “extremely dangerous” for the traditionally independent Justice Department. </p>\n<h3>2) The FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation again</h3>\n<p>It’s not just emails. The FBI has also revived a dormant probe into the Clinton Foundation, according to reports last week by <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/367541-fbi-launches-new-clinton-foundation-investigation?amp&__twitter_impression=true\">the Hill’s John Solomon</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-fbi-is-investigating-the-clinton-foundation/2018/01/05/1aca0d4a-f1cf-11e7-97bf-bba379b809ab_story.html?utm_term=.71c5ed35d3c4\">Washington Post’s Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett</a>. </p>\n<p>Solomon writes that agents have interviewed at least one witness in the past month, with more activity expected soon. He adds that, per one source, “the probe is examining whether the Clintons promised or performed any policy favors in return for largesse to their charitable efforts or whether donors made commitments of donations in hopes of securing government outcomes.”</p>\n<p>Now, again, this isn’t an investigation that the Trump administration conjured entirely from scratch. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/laptop-may-include-thousands-of-emails-linked-to-hillary-clintons-private-server-1477854957\">Wall Street Journal reported last year</a> that the FBI had investigated the Clinton Foundation during the presidential campaign. But, per the Journal, there was a disagreement between some field agents, who wanted to move forward with more aggressive investigative measures, and senior Justice officials, who “repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence.”</p>\n<p>So, the question is, does the FBI have solid evidence that suggests wrongdoing? Or is this new push aimed at pleasing a president who has repeatedly demanded Clinton be investigated?</p>\n<h3>3) The Trump administration made temporary appointments of key US attorneys — skirting the Senate confirmation process</h3>\n<p>Nearly 10 months ago, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/3/10/14890546/trump-us-attorneys-resigned\">suddenly asked</a> dozens of US attorneys who’d been appointed during the Obama administration to resign, even though he didn’t have their replacements ready. </p>\n<p>Since then, he’s failed to get replacements for many of them confirmed by the Senate — in many cases, he didn’t even submit nominations. As a result, career Justice Department officials (and not Trump appointees) have been at the helm of many of these US attorneys’ offices.</p>\n<p>But last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions put a stop to that. Per <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/interim-us-attorneys/index.html\">CNN’s Laura Jarrett</a>, Sessions has filled 10 US attorneys’ offices on an interim basis with his own outsider picks, even though they haven’t been confirmed by the Senate. </p>\n<p>These include US attorneys’ offices in key jurisdictions where the Trump and Kushner family businesses are located — the Eastern District of New York, New Jersey, and the Southern District of New York. (That latter post was helmed by the aggressive prosecutor <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/politics/preet-bharara-podcast-trump-firing/index.html\">Preet Bharara</a> before Trump fired him; Sessions has filled it with Geoffrey Berman, who happens to be Rudy Giuliani’s law partner, and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/19/politics/trump-us-attorney-interviews/index.html\">who Trump interviewed personally</a> for the post last year.)</p>\n<p>This isn’t a permanent problem because by law these interim appointees can only serve for 120 days without Senate confirmation. Still, Trump and Sessions have ensured that, for the next few months at least, they’ll have their people in important federal law enforcement jobs, without Senate scrutiny first. Doing that is legal, but given the president’s evident desire to bend DOJ to his will, it’s troubling.</p>\n<h3>4) Two Republican senators referred the “Steele dossier” author for potential criminal prosecution</h3>\n<p>Two Republican senators made Congress’s first criminal referral in the matter of Russian interference with the 2016 election last week. But it wasn’t about anyone working with Trump — it was about someone <em>investigating</em> Trump.</p>\n<p>Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/christopher-steele-dossier-judiciary-committee.html\">wrote that they believed</a> Christopher Steele, the former British spy hired to look into Trump’s Russia ties and author of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16845704/steele-dossier-russia-trump\">“Steele dossier,”</a> had lied about his contacts with reporters about to federal authorities. So they recommended that the Justice Department look into false statements charges against Steele. (It is entirely up to the Justice Department whether to pursue the matter.)</p>\n<p>Much of the information at issue here is classified or related to the unfolding investigation, so it’s tough to evaluate Grassley and Graham’s charge. But it certainly seems to be part of the broader conservative effort to strike back against the Russia probe, which in recent months has focused increasingly on the dossier (which we now know was ultimately <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/24/16539676/trump-dossier-funded-hillary-clinton\">funded by Hillary Clinton’s campaign</a>) and the FBI’s use of it. </p>\n<p>Now, this move isn’t Trump’s own doing. But it’s clearly coming from his allies. (Grassley has strongly backed the president, while Graham has converted from a strong critic to a booster of Trump’s in recent months.) And it sends an unmistakable message about whose alleged wrongdoings top congressional Republicans are most concerned about — and what they’d like the Justice Department to do.</p>\n<h3>5) The top DOJ and FBI officials Republicans have targeted for criticism are leaving or being sidelined</h3>\n<p>Finally, in recent months, Trump and his allies’ general criticism of the “deep state” has increasingly focused on <em>particular</em> Justice Department or FBI officials they claim have been biased against the president. And this criticism may finally be getting results.</p>\n<p>Most notably, there’s Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Last year, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/944665687292817415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F12%2F23%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fmccabe-fbi-trump-russia.html\">publicly</a> disparaged McCabe, and claimed he’d tried to protect Clinton’s interests. McCabe’s wife was a Democratic candidate for Virginia’s state Senate in 2015, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a longtime Clinton ally, helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for her campaign. She ended up losing the race before McCabe was given supervisory authority over the Clinton email investigation, but word of the fundraising <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-ally-aids-campaign-of-fbi-officials-wife-1477266114\">leaked into the press last year</a>, and conservatives questioned McCabe’s impartiality.</p>\n<p>McCabe remained in his post, serving as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey, and returning to his role as deputy once Trump’s pick Christopher Wray was confirmed to replace Comey. But the criticism — from Trump, congressional Republicans, and conservative media — continued. Finally, word leaked out in December that McCabe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/mccabe-fbi-trump-russia.html\">had decided he’d retire</a> once his pension has fully vested this March.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t stop there. Justice Department official Bruce Ohr was demoted in December, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/07/top-doj-official-demoted-amid-probe-contacts-with-trump-dossier-firm.html\">reportedly because he’d met with Chistopher Steele</a>. And the FBI’s longtime top lawyer, James Baker, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbis-top-lawyer-said-to-be-reassigned/2017/12/21/2ac76640-e6b5-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html\">was also reassigned that same month</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, there were some potential justifications. Ohr’s contact with Steele had come under scrutiny because his wife worked for Fusion GPS, the firm that was paid for the Steele dossier (at the behest of Clinton’s campaign). The FBI personnel changes can be explained as a new director wanting to select his own top staffers — though of course, we only have a new FBI director because Trump fired the old one. </p>\n<p>And again, it is possible that these posts could be filled by officials who will prize law enforcement agencies’ independence and won’t act simply to protect President Trump. But it remains to be seen whether that will happen.</p>\n<p>Overall, we’re still a long way from the Justice Department truly being corrupted and made to serve only the political whims of the president — protecting his friends and going after his enemies. That process would have to start somewhere, however. Hopefully, we won’t later look back and conclude that this is where it began.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

Uncertain of his own <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/h-gobind-khorana-1968-nobel-winner-for-rna-research-dies.html\">birthdate</a> (he guessed it was January 9), Khorana was the fifth child born to a Hindu family in 1922 in Raipur, a 100-person village in the Punjab region of what is now Pakistan.</p>\n<p>He started his education at a village school that met under a tree and quickly demonstrated an aptitude for science, tempered with humility. He received a scholarship to study chemistry at Punjab University in Lahore, but he was too shy to attend the mandatory admissions interview and considered majoring in English instead. </p>\n<p>The admissions committee was still impressed enough with Khorana’s application that they enrolled him anyway. He went on to earn undergraduate and master’s degrees in chemistry at Punjab University, followed by a doctorate in organic chemistry at the University of Liverpool in England. </p>\n<p>His friend Uttam L. RajBhandary, a molecular biology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Khorana was drawn to solving tough, critical problems. “He was not influenced by its difficulty or the time needed to solve it, as long as it was of fundamental importance,” RajBhandary <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/480322a\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Khorana did stints in research institutions in Switzerland and Canada before landing at the Institute for Enzyme Research and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. There, he <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)01509-1\">decoded how cells read</a> the language of RNA written in structures represented by the letters A, C, U, and G. He did this by using enzymes to create sequences of these letters. Arranging them into distinct patterns, he and other scientists found that the genetic code comprised 64 three-letter “words,” known as codons. </p>\n<p>The words code instructions for arranging amino acids, the basic units of proteins. The sequence “GGT” codes the amino acid glycine, for example, while the “UAA” codon tells cellular machinery to stop adding to a nascent protein.</p>\n<p>Put together, the findings yielded something of a Rosetta Stone for genetics, bridging the divide between molecular instructions and the machinery they build. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ftlQ0Iv8TaJw7X-tLKIN1jfcaSI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9997993/genetic_code_acgt_lg__1_.jpg\">\n<cite><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GlossaryDescription/180/0\">National Institutes of Health</a></cite>\n<figcaption>A table showing the three-letter RNA codons associated with proteins</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Khorana went on to develop a way to make a synthetic gene and then place the lab-made gene in a living bacterium. The tiny engineered organism was a massive leap forward, helping launch the biotechnology sector and blazing a trail for scientists looking to manipulate life at its most fundamental levels, including recent work on editing genomes using the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/30/13164064/crispr-cas9-gene-editing\">CRISPR/Cas9</a> system.</p>\n<p>Khorana was working across the fields of chemistry, biology, and physics years before interdisciplinary research was common. One of his students, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/smith-facts.html\">Michael Smith</a>, went on to receive the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work on creating artificial mutations in DNA.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avL2aBaVfaq7PkOu2Z-yIlzMkcg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998523/GettyImages_89859460.jpg\">\n<cite>Apic/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Har Gobind Khorana</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Khorana became a US citizen in 1966 and faculty member at MIT in 1970, retiring in 2007.</p>\n<p>Despite his accomplishments, Khorana’s friends described him as a modest man who avoided publicity. Nonetheless, he maintained his <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/480322a\">scientific curiosity</a> until the end.

Now, in the <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/abc-new-shows/news/shows/roseanne-returns-to-abc\">show’s 2018 revival</a> (debuting in March), Roseanne Conner is a Trump supporter, while her sister Jackie is anything but, which has caused a rift between the two.</p>\n<p>It was a good question to ask on a creative level, since tracing that evolution from an earlier iteration of <em>Roseanne</em> to a later one could offer at least one interpretation of why there were several voters who flipped from being Obama voters in 2012 to Trump voters in 2016, a category it’s not hard to picture Roseanne Conner falling into. (It’s worth stating that the character lives in Illinois, so her vote for Trump didn’t ultimately matter all that much in terms of the electoral college.) </p>\n<p>But the question took on a weird metatextual significance when you consider that Barr herself is one of the president’s foremost celebrity supporters, to the degree that she says her children took her Twitter away from her so as not to have her public proclamations overshadowing the return of the show. And Barr spent almost as much time during the revival’s panel at the Television Critics Association winter press tour dodging questions about her Trump support as she did attempting to explain why her TV husband, Dan (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">John Goodman</a>), is still alive in the revival even though the final season of the original show memorably killed him off (albeit offscreen).</p>\n<p>But McDonald’s question — which I’ll remind you was about the <em>character</em> of Roseanne Conner and not the celebrity Roseanne Barr (though you can see where Barr would get confused) — seemed to get under Barr’s skin, just a little bit. She denied being Trump’s number one cheerleader, but she also seemed to like the way that Trump promised to “shake things up,” which led to her support for him.</p>\n<p>“He says a lot of crazy shit,” Barr said. “I’m not a Trump apologist. There are a lot of things he’s done and said that I don’t agree with in the same way there are probably a lot of things Hillary Clinton has done and said you don’t agree with.”</p>\n<p><em>Roseanne</em> executive producer and writer Whitney Cummings attempted to jump in to explain the creative choice to make Roseanne Conner a Trump supporter by talking about speaking with the Trump supporters in her life — people who did, occasionally, feel conflicted about candidate Trump but ended up voting for him in belief that he would bring jobs back to America. Cummings felt that a desire for jobs would explain Roseanne Conner voting for Trump, even if she didn’t agree with him on everything.</p>\n<p>But Barr leapt back in: “Speaking of racism, I’m just going to say it...” (“You sure you wanna do that?!” interrupted her TV daughter, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004960/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Sara Gilbert</a>, who’s also a producer on the show.)</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Roseanne\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9dCWpjMY49N8VDVH-t2bhjEQNB4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10000431/147831_5959.jpg\">\n<cite>ABC</cite>\n<figcaption>Roseanne Barr and John Goodman star in the revival of Roseanne.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Barr completed her answer by saying that a big reason she couldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton had to do with Haiti, a reference to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/13/did-the-clinton-foundation-raise-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-a-hospital-in-haiti-that-was-never-built/?utm_term=.e636fbf47fb9\">untrue claims</a> that the Clintons raised millions of dollars for a hospital in Haiti that was never built. She also said she was glad that black unemployment is the lowest it’s been in years, presumably crediting Trump with those jobs, then concluded by saying that we need to end “hate-riotism” in America and learn how to talk to each other.</p>\n<p>The irony of this is that the new <em>Roseanne</em> — absent the star’s political leanings — is a genuinely funny, thoughtful take on how white Americans who disagree strongly over the president and his views on essentially anyone who’s <em>not</em> a white American can find a way to talk about these issues without killing each other. The show feels reinvigorated by the political climate in a way that, say, NBC’s <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> reboot just doesn’t. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Barr’s earlier answer about why <em>Roseanne</em> is now straightforwardly <em>about</em> a Trump voter made more sense than anything she said later: “Half the people voted for Trump, and half didn’t. It’s just realistic.”</p>\n<p>Yet in order to take in the show’s consideration of those ideas, viewers who strongly dislike Trump will have to make their way past the star’s vocal support for the president. On some level, everybody involved realizes that this <em>could</em> work in the show’s favor — so long as Barr herself can stay on message. </p>\n<p>But part of the appeal of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094540/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><em>Roseanne</em></a> has always been its star’s refusal to stay on message, to say what she really thinks, to call out the worst things about America where she sees them. If the new <em>Roseanne</em> is thinking about how dicussing politics has fractured relationships in these 2010s, it’s a dark twist that fans will now<strong> </strong>have to ask themselves whether Barr’s politics will dampen their love for the show.</p>",

A court <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/28/13093560/trump-stop-and-frisk-nypd\">struck down</a> the policy in 2013, finding that it had been disproportionately used against minority residents. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also campaigned against the policy as a candidate that year, assuring New Yorkers that his election would be the end of it.</p>\n<p>That led a lot of conservatives — and the police — to warn that crime would spike without stop-and-frisk. Reality, however, tells a different story, Smith explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today in New York City, use of stop-and-frisk, which the department justified via the 1968 <em>Terry v. Ohio</em> Supreme Court ruling, has crashed. Yet the statistics are clear: Crime is lower than ever. It’s possible that crime would be even lower had stop-and-frisk been retained, but that’s moving the goalposts. I and others argued that crime would rise. Instead, it fell. We were wrong. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This isn’t the first time supporters of stop-and-frisk have publicly apologized in an op-ed, with the New York Daily News editorial board <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/wrong-ending-stop-frisk-not-stopping-crime-article-1.2740157\">running a similar mea culpa</a> in 2016. New York City’s persistent crime drops have forced groups with conservative leanings on policing to reevaluate their beliefs.</p>\n<p>“As of December 27, New York City saw 286 homicides in 2017, down 12 percent from the previous year, itself a near-record low,” Smith explained. “That is a rate of about 3 per 100,000 population. By contrast, Chicago’s homicide rate for 2017 was about 24 per 100,000. The figure for Baltimore is about 56. There were more murder victims in Baltimore than in New York City in 2017, even though New York has nearly 14 times as many residents.” (There are lots of reasons for the crime drop in New York and other parts of the country. For more on those, read <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/cards/crime-rate-drop\">Vox’s explainer</a>.)</p>\n<p>So not only did stop-and-frisk violate the rights of minority Americans but it also doesn’t even seem like it was particularly successful at its main goal of combating crime.</p>\n<h3>Stop-and-frisk was at best weak for crime fighting — but definitely alienated minority residents</h3>\n<p>The results are predictable. The <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/crime-rate-drop/broken-windows-police\">research</a> has long found that the effects of stop-and-frisk on crime were weak at best. <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.712152#.Ugoz6mTXi0I\">Some studies</a> suggested stop-and-frisk didn’t have any effect whatsoever. </p>\n<p>It’s notoriously hard to study these issues — how do you separate stop-and-frisk from other policing actions and contributors to crime? — but the body of evidence shows that police departments could stop aggressive overpolicing and use other strategies to make up for the small potential impact of ending stop-and-frisk.</p>\n<p>That’s particularly pertinent because we do know stop-and-frisk had one big effect: It massively increased distrust, particularly among black and brown New Yorkers, toward police. </p>\n<p>It’s not hard to see why. According to city data, the great majority of people who were stopped and frisked in New York City were minority residents. Almost all turned out to have no contraband on them — meaning they weren’t guilty of any crime. And 1 percent of black people who were stopped had weapons or contraband on them, while 1.4 percent of white people stopped did — suggesting that black people weren’t more likely to be doing anything wrong despite getting stopped more often.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Stop and frisk in New York City.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jzm1AloBhfZ134RtYkfNwbiKtw0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6880897/police%20stops.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/2/12316922/police-legitimacy-cartoon\">Alvin Chang/Vox</a></cite>\n</figure>\n<p>New York City police at the time claimed that they were simply conducting a majority of stops in high-crime areas, which are disproportionately black and brown. But as criminologist Jeffrey Fagan <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/Expert_Report_JeffreyFagan.pdf\">found</a>, even if you controlled for crime, minority New Yorkers were still disproportionately stopped:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The percent Black population and the percent Hispanic population predict higher numbers of stops, controlling for the local crime rate and the social and economic characteristics of the precinct. … The crime rate is significant as well, so the identification of the race effects suggests that racial composition has a marginal influence on stops, over and above the unique contributions of crime.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a result of these racial disparities, stop-and-frisk fostered distrust and resentment toward police. That distrust could have actually led to more crime: The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/26/12631962/ghettoside-jill-leovy-black-crime\">evidence</a> shows that police can better solve and prevent crimes if they have the trust and cooperation of their community.</p>\n<p>So it’s potentially a win for everyone involved that New York City managed to end this overly aggressive, racially biased tactic without causing a crime wave. And although criminologists still have a lot to learn from New York City’s massive, decades-long crime drop and what exactly contributed to it, the successful end of stop-and-frisk is a good sign for policing reforms as the nation increasingly wakes up to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/29/12989428/police-shooting-race-crime\">brutality</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism\">racial disparities</a> of the criminal justice system.</p>",

I don’t understand why anyone would ever choose a moniker that conjures up the idea of male genitalia and flashbacks, but then again I may not have my finger on the pulse of TV show title trends. However, when Netflix first started promoting the show, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/when-netflix-suggests-scrotal-recall.html\">I was not alone in my befuddlement</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/9/8575767/scrotal-recall-explained\"><em>Scrotal Recall</em> changed its title to <em>Lovesick</em></a> ahead of its second season, which arrived on Netflix in 2016.</p>\n<p><em>Lovesick </em>is a much less memorable name then <em>Scrotal Recall</em>, but it still gets at the show’s premise: Dylan (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1926865/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Johnny Flynn</a>) is diagnosed with chlamydia and has to call the women he’s been intimate with to inform them of his recent diagnosis. In each episode, we see flashbacks to Dylan’s romances with those women (and why said romances didn’t work out), and along the way we also become familiar with Dylan’s most cherished relationships: his friendships with Evie (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3687902/?ref_=tt_cl_t2\">Antonia Thomas</a>) and Luke (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3958526/?ref_=tt_cl_t3\">Daniel Ings</a>). </p>\n<p>The basics of this premise, coupled with a title like <em>Scrotal Recall</em>, might signal a dude-bro raunch-com about sex feats. But <em>Lovesick</em> is actually a funny and tender gem of a show. Thanks to recent inclement, freezing weather, I managed to binge the entire eight-episode third season, which launched on Netflix on New Year’s Day, over the course of a weekend. </p>\n<p>Here’s what I really like about the series, and why you too should consider checking it out.</p>\n<h3>1) The premise is much more clever than it might sound</h3>\n<p>What makes <em>Lovesick</em> tick is that it operates not just as a love story, but as a mystery. In season one, each episode begins with a title card showing the name of a woman — Abigail, Cressida, Jane, etc. — followed by a flashback to Dylan’s past relationship with that woman. The flashbacks are intercut with scenes of Dylan, Evie, and Luke going about their lives in the present; in that first season, Evie is about to get married. </p>\n<p>The result is the television equivalent of the corner pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. We know the beginning and end points, but we don’t know what happened in between. Each episode fills in more details, slowly painting a bigger picture of how all of Dylan’s relationships have changed his and his friends’ lives — some by a little, some by a lot. </p>\n<p>Writers <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3976567/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr1\">Tom Edge</a> (who also created the series), <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625195/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr2\">Andy Baker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3982828/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr3\">Ed Macdonald</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3557291/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr4\">Mark Grimme</a> prevent “calling someone with unfortunate STD news” from feeling like a gimmick by using that framing to reveal the depths of Dylan, Evie, and Luke’s friendship. As <em>Lovesick</em> progresses, we get to see how this trio — which is so tight-knit in the present — came together, with moments like their first meeting or a trip they took offering emotional insight into their bond in present day. </p>\n<p>The series rewards you for investing in its characters by caring for them every step of the way. And as the show finds its rhythm in seasons two and three you begin to realize that <em>Lovesick</em> is just as much or even more about these three friends than it is about Dylan’s love life. </p>\n<h3>2) The three lead actors are impossibly charming</h3>\n<p>Of the three lead actors, Flynn, who plays the show’s main lead Dylan, probably has the least splashy role. <em>Lovesick</em> is, after all, a story about how Dylan’s romantic relationships never seem to work out. </p>\n<p>Dylan isn’t filthy and funny like Ings’s Luke is, nor does he get the messier, confused moments of relatability that Thomas enjoys as Evie. They’re both have a bit more edge about them. But Flynn still imbues Dylan with a unique charm and keeps him from falling into the shopworn and ultimately forgettable “nice guy” territory. </p>\n<p>Ings (who fans of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/9/16748048/the-crown-season-2-review\"><em>The Crown</em></a> will recognize as Mike Parker, Philip’s dodgy wingman) gets to really showcase his comedic chops as Luke. Luke is silly and campy with a penchant for raunchy humor, and Ings excels at it playing it all. One standout scene in <em>Lovesick</em>’s second season involves Luke, a deer, said deer screeching, and the conundrum of defecating in the woods. It is perfect. </p>\n<p>And Thomas is buoyant as Evie. When <em>Lovesick</em> begins, Evie is a messy tempest of unrequited love, and as the series progresses, and without giving too much away, that ... changes somewhat. You understand the pain and helplessness that Evie feels with just one of Thomas’s sharpened looks, or the slightest knitting of her brow. But an occasional smirk or glimmer in her eyes lets you see the character’s moxie and sunniness — Thomas’s knack for striking this balance in Evie comes through in <em>Lovesick</em>’s very first episode. </p>\n<p>Together, the three actors have created one of television’s best portrayals of friendship. The relationship between their characters isn’t perfect; <em>Lovesick</em> doesn’t shy away from showing how Dylan, Luke, and Evie are all capable of hurting each other (whether they know it or not). But the very best friendships in real life aren’t all sun, fun, and games. </p>\n<h3>3) The show is, quite simply, about love</h3>\n<p>My favorite thing about <em>Lovesick</em> is how mature it is on the subject of love. The show’s plot twists — and there <em>are</em> a couple — never feel manipulative or forced. Likewise, its stories never approach overly soapy, sudsy levels of drama; this is not a show that makes a point of tugging your heartstrings with extraneous monologues or dramatic declarations of feelings. </p>\n<p><em>Lovesick</em> just wants to capture what it’s like when regular people fall in love, and how real relationships often don’t match up with what pop culture teaches us about how love presents itself. And it’s at its best when it asks questions about what those real relationships actually feel like. </p>\n<p>What if there’s no such thing as “true” love? What if love is temporary? What happens to love if the timing isn’t right for it? What if love and happiness aren’t bound together? </p>\n<p><em>Lovesick</em>’s only clean, tidy answer is that love doesn’t always look the way you want it to. </p>\n<p>The show is very clear on the fact that love doesn’t always come with a grand pronouncement or a stomach full of butterflies. Sometimes it’s a dusty old thing. Sometimes there’s more love in a one-night stand than there is in a long-term relationship. Sometimes nothing works out the way you want it to. But no matter what it looks like or how long it lasts, if we find it, we should feel lucky. </p>\n<p>And I’m glad <em>Lovesick</em> is committed to telling that story. </p>",

Trump and his family were worried about what the FBI would find out about their finances — and wanted the investigation quashed. The final decision, on May 9, was made with virtually no input from his team; most of the West Wing staff reportedly found out about it from Fox News.</p>\n<p>“In presidential annals,” Wolff writes, “the firing of FBI director James Comey may be the most consequential move ever made by a modern president acting entirely on his own.”</p>\n<p>Wolff’s description of the Comey firing has gotten less media attention than some of the book’s more inflammatory nuggets, like the idea that Trump didn’t actually expect, or want, to win the 2016 election. But it illustrates perhaps the book’s most important takeaway: The way in which this White House makes major foreign policy and national security decisions is fundamentally broken, and the root cause is Donald Trump himself.</p>\n<p>From bombing Syria to the surge in Afghanistan to the standoff with North Korea, Trump behaves largely as he did during the deliberations over whether to fire Comey: ignoring the facts of the situation, making decisions rooted principally in his own personal feelings or connections, then failing to understand the consequences of his actions even after they’ve been taken.</p>\n<p>We shouldn’t treat <em>Fire and Fury</em> as gospel; Wolff has a <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/67746/wolff-trapped\">long history</a> of playing loose with the facts and using questionable methods to arrive at his conclusions. Still, the overall portrait jibes with more than a year of other reporting about the Trump presidency. </p>\n<p>Given that the president has nearly unfettered power to make major foreign policy decisions, it’s worth taking a serious look at the book’s primary conclusion about Trump as commander in chief.</p>\n<p>“If the Trump White House was as unsettling as any in American history,” Wolff writes, “the president’s views of foreign policy and the world at large were among its most random, uninformed, and seemingly capricious aspects.”</p>\n<h3>The book’s scariest insight is into how Trump makes decisions</h3>\n<p>Trump, unlike previous presidents, did not come into the White House with any real sense of what he wanted to accomplish in world affairs. “His advisers didn’t know whether he was an isolationist or a militarist, or whether he could distinguish between the two,” Wolff writes.</p>\n<p>The result is a foreign policy dominated and shaped by Trump’s personal peccadilloes rather than any kind of ideology or comprehensive worldview. It’s hard to imagine a person less well-suited to making foreign policy decisions than the Trump that appears in Wolff’s book.</p>\n<p>The president is practically allergic to facts or being briefed on new situations. This became clear to Trump’s aides during the presidential transition, when he started to receive briefings from US intelligence.</p>\n<p>“It was during Trump’s early intelligence briefings, held soon after he captured the nomination, that alarm signals first went off among his new campaign staff,” Wolff writes. “He seemed to lack the ability to take in third-party information.”</p>\n<p>Trump also appears deeply reluctant to learn anything more about a given country or conflict. He has come to despise National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, according to Wolff, because McMaster’s briefings are full of dry information about various global hotspots.</p>\n<p>“That guy bores the shit out of me,” the president reportedly declared after meeting the general for the first time, an impression that hasn’t changed over the course of time. Within six weeks, Wolff writes, Trump was threatening to fire McMaster for being too boring.</p>\n<div><aside><q>“The staff’s goal was to keep him off North Korea”</q></aside></div>\n<p>That means that Trump has been unwilling, or unable, to give serious attention to thorny issues like the brutal Syrian civil war. His first major foreign policy crisis, Bashar al-Assad’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/4/8/15218782/syria-trump-bomb-assad-explainer\">deadly April 4 chemical attack </a>in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun, was met with anger from the Oval Office occupant — but not for the reasons one might expect. </p>\n<p>“To both [Jared] Kushner and McMaster,” Wolff writes, “it seemed obvious that the president was more annoyed about having to think about the attack than by the attack itself.”</p>\n<p>The issue was resolved when Ivanka Trump and White House aide Dina Powell put together a slideshow of images showing children who had been poisoned by the attack. The gruesome images, together with the first daughter’s emotional investment, captured the president’s imagination — leading him to order an attack on a Syrian government airfield.</p>\n<p>The Syria episode speaks to the fundamental ways that foreign policy decisions actually get made in the White House, per Wolff: Trump’s emotions and personal connections. Again and again in the book, the president ends up being swayed to one side or the other by personal sentiment.</p>\n<p>The decision to fire Comey came after weeks of lobbying from Kushner and Ivanka, who were (in Wolff’s telling) terrified of what the Russia probe might turn up about their family’s finances. Trump’s cozying up to Russia, longtime Trump friend Roger Ailes told Wolff, came from a near-pathological need for Putin’s approval. </p>\n<p>The president’s support for Saudi Arabia’s blockade of neighboring Qatar in June, which caused a major rift in the Arab world, seems to stem largely from Jared Kushner’s budding personal friendship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Sultan, who is virtually certain to be the country’s next king. “Jared’s gotten the Arabs totally on our side,” Trump reportedly crowed in May.</p>\n<p>This one-two punch — Trump’s disdain for facts and overriding focus on feelings and personalities — has made the president largely blind to the consequences of his actions. Per Wolff’s account, the president orders major policy changes — bombing Syrian government installations for the first time, withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement, sending more troops to Afghanistan — with little to no understanding of what the consequences might be.</p>\n<p>Take Trump’s vow to meet North Korean provocations with “fire and fury the world has never seen,” the episode from which Wolff’s book takes its name. The statement was improvised during an August press conference that was supposed to focus on opioids. It was, Wolff reports, born equal parts out of Trump’s policy ignorance and personal antagonism to Kim Jong Un:</p>\n<blockquote><p>North Korea had been a heavy-on-detail, short-on-answers problem that he [Trump] believed was the product of lesser minds and weaker resolve — and that he had trouble paying attention to. What’s more, he had increasingly personalized his antagonism with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, referring to him often with derogatory epithets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The statement terrified North Korea experts, who were worried about Trump provoking a war with another nuclear-armed power. It also terrified Trump’s staff, according to Wolff, as they spent the next week trying to get the president to stop talking about it — with even the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, held several days after the “fire and fury” statement, serving as an initially welcome change of subject.</p>\n<p>“North Korea, a situation the president had consistently been advised to downplay, now became the central subject of the rest of the week — with most senior staff occupied not so much by the topic itself but by how to respond to the president, who was threatening to ‘blow’ again,” Wolff writes. “Charlottesville was a mere distraction, and indeed, the staff’s goal was to keep him off North Korea.”</p>\n<p>All of this serves as a windup to Wolff’s most fundamental, and perhaps scariest, conclusion — that the president is psychologically incapable of understanding the consequences of his actions. When Trump does something, like fire Comey or bomb Syria or threaten North Korea, he does so without any sense of how human beings might be affected by his actions. </p>\n<p>“One of Trump’s deficiencies — a constant in the campaign and, so far, in the presidency — was his uncertain grasp of cause and effect,” Wolff writes. “Everyone [in the White House], in his or own way, struggled to express the baldly obvious fact that the president did not know enough, did not know what he didn’t know, did not particularly care and, to boot, was confident if not serene in his unquestioned certitudes.”</p>\n<p>The most basic part of rationality, in the way that political scientists and economists define it, is the ability to link means and ends. A rational person identifies the goals they wish to pursue, picks out courses of action that they believe could further said goals, and then pursues them.</p>\n<p>If Wolff’s book is even fractionally right — if one-tenth of the specific stories in there are true — then we are dealing with a president who does not meet that standard. </p>",

The US comes in last.</p> <p>A child born in the United States has a 70 percent greater chance of dying before adulthood than kids born into other wealthy, democratic countries, a new study has found. </p>\n<p>The research, published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/\">Health Affairs</a> on Monday, shows that the United States lags far behind peer countries on child health outcomes. It estimates that, since 1961, America’s poor performance accounts for more than 600,000 excess child deaths — deaths that wouldn’t have happened if these kids were born into other wealthy countries<strong>. </strong></p>\n<p>“In all the wealthy, democratic countries we studied children are dying less often then they were 50 years ago,” Ashish Thakrar, the study’s lead author, said. “But we found that children are dying more often in the United States than in any similar country.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRZHwBjE9PpBC5dZf0bBYKQQ_gI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998545/OECD_v_US_child_mortality_rate.jpg\">\n<cite>Christina Animashaun/Vox</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>The study comes out three months after Congress allowed funding for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/5/16856000/chip-funding-expiring-january-19\">Children’s Health Insurance Program</a> — which provides insurance to nine million low-income kids — to expire. And it builds on data released earlier this year, which finds that overall life expectancy in the United States has <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/npr/572080314/life-expectancy-drops-again-as-opioid-deaths-surge-in-u-s\">declined</a> for the past two years — a troubling trend that hasn’t been seen since the 1960s. </p>\n<h3>Infants in the US have a 76 percent higher risk of death than in other wealthy nations </h3>\n<p>Between 2001 and 2010, researchers found that the risk of death in the United States was 76 percent higher for infants than in peer countries. In addition, the US has an infant death rate from extreme prematurity three times that of its peer countries. </p>\n<p>The new Health Affairs study compared the United States to 19 other wealthy, democratic countries including Canada, Australia, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>It found that all 20 countries have seen declines in childhood deaths since the 1960s, a positive trend. At the same time, it also shows that the United States has ranked <em>the wors</em><em>t</em> in childhood deaths since the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Thakrar and his co-authors found that the United States is especially far off from its peer countries when it comes to infants and teenagers.</p>\n<p>Thakrar argues that some of this most likely has to do with America’s fragmented health care system. A new mother may go without health insurance before becoming pregnant — when she would usually qualify for Medicaid — and that could lead to untreated health issues ultimately affecting the child.</p>\n<p>“It really seems to be the impact of our fragmented health care system,” Thakrar says. “Mothers who are qualifying for Medicaid for the first time because they’re mothers might be seeing doctors for the first time. They might not have a family physician, or a clear support system.”</p>\n<p>Other social factors likely play a role. Thakrar, for example, points to the rise in childhood poverty in the 1980s that coincided with the United States falling behind its peer countries on health outcomes.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bl3UYXvpSRVm0qPPqLk6UbGJ8dY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998553/US_poverty_rate_U18.jpg\">\n<cite>Christina Animashaun/Vox</cite>\n</figure>\n<h3>Teenagers in the United States are 82 times more likely to die from gun homicide</h3>\n<p>Teenagers also have significantly poorer outcomes in the United States. </p>\n<p>Perhaps most startling, children between the ages of 15 and 19 are 82 times more likely to die from gun homicide in the United States than in peer countries. </p>\n<p>America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts\">half</a> of the civilian-owned guns around the world. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170206100059/http://tewksburylab.org/blog/2012/12/gun-violence-and-gun-ownership-lets-look-at-the-data/\">Research</a> shows that the more guns in a country, the more gun deaths. Conversely, states with fewer guns have fewer gun deaths. </p>\n<p>And US teenagers are twice as likely to die in car accidents than their peers abroad. </p>\n<h3>Kids are dying in the United States more than other countries. Congress isn’t funding kids’ health insurance.</h3>\n<p>The Children’s Health Insurance Program is a cheap, successful program that provides health care coverage to nine million low and middle-income children. Its budget expired 100 days ago — and Republicans in Congress have done next to nothing about it. </p>\n<p>Multiple states have sent out letters warning families that their kids’ health insurance may end on January 31. Congress did pass a temporary bill that it expected to extend CHIP’s lifespan until March — but it turns out, they got the math wrong, and states may run out of funding as early as January 19.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Congress failed to reauthorize spending for a home visitation program that serves low-income families and their children. Funding for <a href=\"https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/home-visiting-overview\">Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting</a> ran out the same day as CHIP, and there is no conversation about extending its budget.</p>\n<p>Thakrar worries that the instability in how we fund health care programs will only exacerbate the United States’ dismal performance on child health — and that it’s hard to see the situation improving without a clear government commitment toward improving children’s health. </p>\n<p>“We’re seeing the effects of instability right now,” he said. “All across the country families are waiting to hear if CHIP will be reinstated, whether they’ll continue to have health insurance, their household visitations are at risk. Programs that have proven their benefit in the country still face constant instability.”</p>\n<p></p>",

But the <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> host did just that last April, when he used his late-night show to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/5/2/15513404/jimmy-kimmel-monologue-newborn-son-healthcare-surgery\">share the personal story</a> of how his newborn son required emergency heart surgery, and urged his audience to educate themselves on Republican efforts to rewrite the health care legislation that made said surgery possible. What’s more, he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16337466/jimmy-kimmel-test-bill-cassidy-graham\">kept</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/21/16344070/jimmy-kimmel-health-care-graham-cassidy-response\">returning</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/22/16349340/jimmy-kimmel-cassidy-obamacare\">to the subject</a> for months afterward, keeping the health care debate at the forefront of his topical monologues in September as Congress inched closer and closer to a possible Obamacare repeal.</p>\n<p>Now, as Kimmel moves forward in year two of Donald Trump’s presidency, he is keeping the door open to once again come back to this somber subject — if the news necessitates it. “I feel like I happened into a situation at a very specific time in American history in which I was able to say something that hopefully at least made people pay attention, if nothing else,” Kimmel said during ABC’s press day at the Television Critics Association winter press tour, adding that even though health care is an atypical topic for him, he hopes the unusual segments inspired people “to pick up their telephones and tell their leaders what they expect and what they want.”</p>\n<p>But Kimmel, who was both <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/why-jimmy-kimmel-is-the-most-important-host-in-late-night.html\">lauded</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/2/jimmy-kimmel-elitist-creep-who-needs-shut-up/\">derided</a> in the wake of taking a more serious than usual approach to politics on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>, still sought to downplay his overall importance in the grand scheme of things, given the fervor that greeted his more audacious commentary.</p>\n<p>“I think there are people who give me credit for saving Obamacare, and I reject that,” he emphasized. “You see a guy you think you know, and his baby has had a serious health issue ... I don’t think it’s particularly remarkable that Americans reacted that way. ... Ultimately, whatever side we’re on, we agree on that. We have to take care of children.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether health care might come up when he hosts this year’s Oscars ceremony in March, Kimmel seemed skeptical — but given how quickly and unpredictably the news develops these days, he didn’t outright dismiss the possibility. “It’s two months from now,” he said. “[So] it’s like getting into a hot tub: You can’t know what the temperature is until you get in there.”</p>",

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to </em><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/newsletters\"><em><strong>get VoxCare in your inbox here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>One hundred days ago, Congress let the funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program expire. For one hundred days, a program that covers 9 million American children has been left in this strange limbo, with the worst consequences being averted but nonetheless creeping closer.</p>\n<p>On Friday, if you missed it, we got <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/5/16856000/chip-funding-expiring-january-19\"><strong>a new warning</strong></a> from the Trump administration: The short-term CHIP extension that passed in December, which was supposed to last through March, could actually only guarantee the program would stay funded through January 19 — or maybe the end of the month.</p>\n<p>Within the next two weeks, states could start running out of CHIP funding, which could force them to freeze enrollment or drop kids off the rolls.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday, we learned that the price tag for extending CHIP for five years has shrunk dramatically. The CBO estimated the five-year extension Congress is considering now costs only $800 million, down from $8.3 billion, after Republicans repealed the individual mandate in their tax bill.</p>\n<p>The mechanics are wonky, but this is the gist: Repealing the mandate increases ACA premiums; because ACA coverage is the alternative to CHIP for many kids, it would cost the federal government more if CHIP were to end and those children moved to the ACA markets. That makes extending CHIP cheaper, from the government’s point of view. </p>\n<p>That’s a drop in the bucket for Congress. Yet here we are, 100 days in, and Congress hasn’t figured out when they’re going to resolve this.</p>\n<p>So what happens if kids are frozen out of coverage or their state is forced to drop them? It is true that many of kids could get coverage through the ACA markets (though Alabama’s CHIP director has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/27/16373494/chip-funding-reauthorization-congress\"><strong>warned</strong></a> reporters: “A fair amount of our children we think will become uninsured.”) </p>\n<p>But that still has real consequences for the kids and their families.</p>\n<p>Some research from 2014 <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0264\"><strong>published</strong></a> in Health Affairs is instructive. Comparing Medicaid and CHIP coverage to employer-sponsored plans, researchers from the Urban Institute found that less than 10 percent of families enrolled through Medicaid or CHIP had difficulty paying any of their children’s medical bills, while 19 percent of families with private insurance — roughly twice as many — did have trouble. </p>\n<p>Medicaid and CHIP are simply more generous than private insurance: 69 percent of families in those programs reported no out-of-pocket costs for medical care, compared to 22 percent for those with private insurance. </p>\n<p>That likely contributes to another foreseeable outcome: Families with private coverage were more likely to forgo health care they needed because it was unaffordable. The differences were relatively slight, but still consistent across several kinds of care:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>6.4 percent</strong> of Medicaid/CHIP families skipped medical care because it was unaffordable; <strong>8.9 percent</strong> of employer-covered families did.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>7.9 percent</strong> of Medicaid/CHIP families didn’t purchase prescription drugs because of their cost, versus <strong>9.6 percent</strong> of families with private coverage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>9.2 percent</strong> of Medicaid/CHIP families missed dental care because it was unaffordable; <strong>15.7 percent</strong> of those with private coverage did the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps it goes without saying, but <a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Medicaid-provides-needed-access-to-care.pdf\"><strong>this chart</strong></a> from Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families also makes clear that kids covered by Medicaid and CHIP fare far better on accessing care than uninsured children.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cmn_X8Gm9e2oFrfIc-QQz810cg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998099/voxcare_1_jan_8.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>We find this to be true <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22451618\"><strong>again</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/33706/413276-CHIPRA-Mandated-Evaluation-of-the-Children-s-Health-Insurance-Program-Final-Findings.PDF\"><strong>again</strong></a> across multiple studies.</p>\n<p>(Just a note: Medicaid and CHIP are so intertwined that researchers often analyze them in tandem when looking at these issues for children.)</p>\n<p>”These studies consistently show that CHIP has improved access to and affordability of care for kids,” Jenny Kenney at the Urban Institute, who has conducted some of this research, told me by email.</p>\n<p>The story here is pretty clear: Medicaid and CHIP provide coverage comparable to private health insurance at a lower cost to families. If Congress continues to leave CHIP unfunded, families have basically two options: enroll in ACA coverage or become uninsured. Health care could become unaffordable for millions of families, and they could be forced to skip needed appointments and treatments.</p>\n<p>This is what Congress is risking, in a very real way, as we are now days away from states running out of CHIP funding.</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;vox_care&quot;}\"></div></aside><h3>Chart of the Day</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_r2ktMkWKg-pDmTNAfprJhUvf0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9998103/voxcare_2_jan_8.jpg\">\n<cite>Javier Zarracina/Vox</cite>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Extending CHIP is so cheap. </strong>We published <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/21/16803312/chip-extension-congress-tax-cuts-obamacare-repeal\"><strong>an earlier version</strong></a> of this chart, when extending CHIP for five years cost $8 billion.

It was, instead, about an issue that he’s paid scant attention to in public for his first year in office: the US relationship with Pakistan.</p>\n<p>“The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit,” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/947802588174577664\">tweeted</a> on January 1. “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”</p>\n<p>It quickly became clear that Trump’s tweet was more than an idle threat. On Thursday the State Department announced that the US was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-suspends-security-aid-to-pakistan/2018/01/04/303145e4-f18a-11e7-b3bf-ab90a706e175_story.html?utm_term=.257f10e8ec84\">freezing most military aid to Pakistan</a>. The administration has declined to specify the exact amount of funds it will cut off, but the suspension could freeze <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-pakistan-aid.html?mtrref=www.google.com\">up to $1.3 billion in aid.</a></p>\n<p>The move has infuriated Pakistan. Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistan-says-alliance-with-u-s-is-over-1515155860?mg=prod/accounts-wsj\">told the Wall Street Journal on Friday</a> that the US had turned Islamabad into a “whipping boy” to distract from its own failures in the war in Afghanistan. He also implied that the US’s move could end up torching cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues like sharing intelligence. “We do not have any alliance” with the US, he said. “This is not how allies behave.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s decision to freeze huge amounts of aid to Pakistan is driven by a grievance that was also held by the Obama administration — that Pakistan is aiding powerful anti-US militant groups in Afghanistan. </p>\n<p>What makes this tricky for the US is that Pakistan could choose to retaliate by doing things like cutting off intelligence sharing and blocking the US from using supply routes that are crucial for its ability to conduct its military operations in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>The US has influence over Pakistan with its aid, but Pakistan is so crucial to the US’s foreign policy initiatives in the region that it too has plenty of leverage. In other words, if the US pushes too hard, it could backfire.</p>\n<h3>American aid to Pakistan has long been plagued by mistrust</h3>\n<p>US aid to Pakistan has been a point of tension and controversy for both countries for decades.</p>\n<p>During the Cold War, the US showered Pakistan with money so it would help drive Soviet Union troops out of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Under President Ronald Reagan, the US provided Pakistan with <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/16/the-double-game\">$2 billion in military aid</a> and $3 billion in economic assistance for development. The US worked with Pakistan (in particular, its military and its powerful intelligence agency, known as the Inter-Services Intelligence or<strong> </strong>ISI) to fuel an anti-Soviet Islamist insurgency in Afghanistan. The plan worked — and the Soviets <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/15/newsid_4160000/4160827.stm\">pulled out in 1989.</a> </p>\n<p>Just one year later, the US <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/16/the-double-game\">cut off military aid to Pakistan</a>. On the surface, it was because the US was putting heavy sanctions on Pakistan to punish it for its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program. </p>\n<p>But the US had known about that program <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OUSTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=us+knew+pakistan+nuclear+1980s&source=bl&ots=xZALRjC6uy&sig=ajGCSCR4GjK01UoXBBHwl0TSySQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwishcjAqsfYAhWjTd8KHZrOBCwQ6AEIUzAI#v=onepage&q=us%20knew%20pakistan%20nuclear%201980s&f=false\">for many years prior.</a> Experts and diplomats say Islamabad believed aid was <em>really </em>being cut off because the US had achieved their goal of driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan. Pakistan found the timing particularly galling: Afghanistan was sliding into a civil war in the wake of the Soviet withdrawal, which put Pakistan in a vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>“Pakistan had gone from being an ally to being the most sanctioned of adversaries, with a hot war right on their border,” Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador to Pakistan during the George W. Bush administration, told me. </p>\n<p>Pakistan felt abandoned, and that informs its skepticism toward the purpose and longevity of US aid today. </p>\n<h3>After 9/11, the US wanted Pakistan’s help again to fight the war on terror</h3>\n<p>Fast forward to the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The US sought to topple the Taliban, which had given shelter to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda while they plotted the 9/11 attacks. All of a sudden, Pakistan was a crucial ally again, and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/16/the-double-game\">billions of dollars</a> of US aid with few strings attached started to flow into the country.</p>\n<p>Pakistan was deeply important for the US-led war in Afghanistan. Pakistan had built strong ties with the Taliban in the ‘90s after they triumphed in the Afghan civil war, and the group took refuge in its mountainous and largely lawless Western frontier region. And the US needed routes through Pakistan to supply its war efforts.</p>\n<p>So the US wanted Pakistan to help it fight against the Taliban. But there’s one problem: Pakistan doesn’t really <em>want </em>the Taliban to be defeated.</p>\n<p>The main reason is that Pakistan doesn’t consider the Taliban — or the Haqqani network, its aggressive offshoot, which the US also sees as an enemy — to be adversaries; rather, the Pakistani security establishment views them as useful proxies to try to ensure that Afghanistan takes on a pro-Pakistan posture, especially when the war ends.</p>\n<p>Pakistan’s leaders also fear potential blowback. If the Pakistani government takes real action against the Taliban and Haqqani network, they could end up turning their guns on the Pakistani government instead of just focusing on Afghanistan. </p>\n<p>As a result, Pakistan essentially plays a double game with Washington: taking billions of dollars in US aid money to help fight the “war on terror,” while covertly providing safe havens for the Taliban within Pakistan’s borders. Vanda Felbab-Brown, an Afghanistan expert at the Brookings Institution, told me the ISI has at times even shared intelligence and provided material support to the Taliban and Haqqani network. </p>\n<p>The US is aware of this double game, and isn’t happy about it. The Obama administration froze or canceled part of its promised aid to Pakistan on various occasions for this reason, like when it suspended <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-aid/us-to-hold-back-800-mln-in-aid-to-pakistan-report-idUSTRE76903U20110710\">$800 million in aid in 2011</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/politics/us-suspends-security-assistance-to-pakistan/index.html\">withheld $350 million in military aid in 2016</a>. But so far, this tactic hasn’t worked, and Pakistan continues to enable the Taliban and Haqqani Network.</p>\n<h3>The US has a lot to lose if Pakistan decides to cut off its assistance</h3>\n<p>The Trump administration is not only freezing aid to Pakistan; it’s also threatening <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-pakistan-actions/white-house-says-to-announce-actions-on-pakistan-within-days-idUSKBN1ER1NG\">additional actions</a> to pressure it to change its policies toward the Taliban and the Haqqani network. Analysts say those actions could take many forms, including expanding drone strikes against militant groups in Pakistan, imposing sanctions on Pakistani officials accused of having ties to terrorist networks, and designating Pakistan a state sponsor of terror.</p>\n<p>But it’s going to be very difficult to persuade Pakistan to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>That’s because Washington still benefits a lot from the partnership between the two countries, and Pakistan knows it. Ahsan Butt, a professor of international relations focusing on security in South Asia at George Mason University, told me that that Pakistan has helped the US enormously in its fight against al-Qaeda (with the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/did-pakistan-know-about-bin-laden-living-there-2015-5\">major exception of tracking down Osama bin Laden</a>). The US military also uses Pakistani military bases to launch drone strikes against militants.</p>\n<p>And the US benefits a great deal from being able to use Pakistani roads and airspace for delivering war supplies to landlocked Afghanistan. The other best point of entry is Iran, which is unlikely to give the US the same kind of access anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Experts say that<strong> </strong>if Pakistan shuts off this access, the alternative would likely involve using Central Asian countries north of Afghanistan and more aircraft to deliver supplies, which is far more expensive. “The alternative routes for US supplies into Afghanistan cost seven to eight times more,” Mosharraf Zaidi, a former adviser to Pakistan’s foreign minister from 2011 to 2013, told me. </p>\n<p>If Pakistan decides to retaliate, some or all of these benefits could go away. Pakistan could stop sharing intelligence on terrorist groups with the US. It could seal off its bases. It could shut down supply routes, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-15908345/pakistan-shuts-down-nato-supply-routes-into-afghanistan\">as it did in 2011</a> after the US attacked a Pakistani border post, killing 25 Pakistani soldiers, (They reopened supply routes<strong> </strong>after the US apologized in 2013.) </p>\n<p>Pakistan could also end up embracing the US’s rivals, China and Russia, to compensate for Washington’s rejection.</p>\n<p>“Russia has been licking its lips at the prospects of avenging the Soviet defeat to US-backed Mujahideen in Afghanistan, and Putin is from a generation of KGB officers that has not forgotten that humiliation,” Zaidi said.</p>\n<p>And while China has already grown very close to Pakistan in recent years with its <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21728619-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-project-carries-risks-massive-chinese-investment-boon\">massive investment in Pakistani infrastructure</a>, Zaidi says that “deepening that relationship would possibly permanently move Pakistan out of the US orbit of influence.”</p>\n<p>So while the US might be the one providing the aid, Pakistan has plenty of arrows in its quiver in this standoff.</p>",

After Oprah Winfrey’s moving speech at the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/8/16862512/golden-globes-oprah-winfrey-2018-metoo-harassment\">Golden Globe awards</a> last night, there’s buzz about her being “our next president.” The response among political scientists has tilted, in a strongly negative direction. Over the summer I wrote about the pitfalls of an amateur approach to politics, especially presidential politics. Now seems like a good time to jump into the implications of this debate. </p>\n<p>First of all, a few things I could have explained better in the first piece: The amateur approach to politics is an attitude as well as a biographical feature. It implies that what’s needed to fix politics is someone who is innocent of the whole mess. Second, the amateur argument is especially focused on the presidency. Political leaders have to start somewhere — Congress or the state legislature, or perhaps city politics are great entry points. For a variety of reasons, the presidency is not a good launching point. </p>\n<p>Having people from different professional backgrounds in office can bring benefits. Substantive expertise from another field — science, business, or the military — can help inform the policy debate. But it has to be mixed with an understanding of government and politics. This includes comprehension and appreciation for the nature of public service, the checks and balances of the Constitution, and the complex trade-offs of democracy. </p>\n<p>In particular, democracy can be slow and inefficient, incorporating the needs of many constituencies and coalitions. Governments do not perform the same functions as businesses, so leaders moving in from the private sector will adapt their approach accordingly. </p>\n<p> Another implication of amateur politics is that in order to govern, you do eventually need to <a href=\"https://blog.oup.com/2017/12/understand-politics-networks-groups-individuals/\">build a coalition</a>. Even the most charismatic president can’t govern alone. For Trump, this has meant relying on the most loyal partisans as well as the most committed movement conservatives, in many ways creating the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/02/trump-isnt-changing-the-republican-party-the-republican-party-is-changing-trump/\">opposite</a> of an independent, flexible presidency. </p>\n<p>Republicans and Democrats function somewhat differently, but there’s no obvious reason to believe that a Democratic outsider would be any different. We could probably expect a celebrity with few formal party ties to be similarly dependent on partisans and ideologues to work through the details of governing. </p>\n<p>The dynamics for a potential Oprah candidacy could be a bit different, however. For one thing, she <a href=\"https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/oprah-endorses-obama-2/\">endorsed Barack Obama</a> in 2008 and has ties to the Democratic Party in that regard, and so it’s not inconceivable that she could tap into the former president’s elite networks if she did decide to enter politics. The substance of a celebrity campaign would also matter — if Winfrey ran as an anti-party outsider, she’d likely encounter this problem — if not, she’d probably have access to the usual talent pool for executive branch positions. But that would partly undercut the whole appeal of such a bid. </p>\n<p>Perhaps more important than the debate about whether Oprah should seek the presidency is the reason why such arguments appear viable. A <a href=\"https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/oprah-endorses-obama-2/\">pervasive distrust</a> of institutions and parties marks the contemporary political landscape. In particular, the 2016 election illustrated the obstacles faced by candidates with baggage from past administrations. During the primaries, Donald Trump was able to distance himself from the Bush administration in a way that many of his opponents found more difficult. Hillary Clinton had to answer for <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/09/07/hillary_clinton_voting_for_iraq_war_was_from_my_perspective_my_mistake.html\">her Iraq War vote</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/02/04/clinton_before_it_was_called_obamacare_it_was_called_hillarycare.html\">policies</a> of the Obama administration, and positions she took during her time as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/3/9/11184040/clinton-first-lady\">first lady</a>. </p>\n<p>This principle applies to professional politicians as well, conferring advantages to those who aren’t as clearly tied to the status quo. It’s important to hold politicians accountable. But if experience and political linkages are <a href=\"http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/69546/frontmatter/9780521869546_frontmatter.pdf\">politically toxic</a>, we’ve got problems. </p>\n<p>It’s tempting to suggest that the response to compelling speeches — whether <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=76988\">Obama’s 2004 DNC speech</a>,* Trump’s rallies, or Winfrey’s recent words — suggests that too many Americans don’t really get what the presidency is about. Certainly there are some key drawbacks to a rhetorically fueled rise. It undermines <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/16/obama-built-a-policy-legacy-but-didnt-do-enough-to-build-the-democratic-party/?utm_term=.e91a93ef7ffe\">party building</a> by cutting off public servants who have built their careers at the state and local level. Furthermore, speeches are only one of the functions of the presidency — there’s a lot of decision-making, coalition-building, and administration management. </p>\n<p>But before political scientists dismiss reactions to these speeches, we might do well to consider their appeal. What Winfrey’s speech last night has in common with Obama’s 2004 speech and Trump’s campaign rhetoric is that all of these confronted race and national identity. Obama leveraged his heritage and background to reframe American political divisions. Trump staked out a much different position about national identity and nationalism, promising to “Make America Great Again” and put “America first,” and sending strong signals about race and belonging. Winfrey spoke of injustice along racial and gender lines, and what it looks like to overcome these challenges. </p>\n<p>In the modern era, mainstream politicians have demonstrated an immense capacity to <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-charlottesville-racial-violence/\">dodge and equivocate</a> on these crucial and divisive issues. Does the political environment prevent politicians from addressing race and identity in a way that sounds authentic — and still be considered viable for the presidency? I’m not sure this is completely true, and it’s probably changing as these issues gain more salience. But it seems possible that this is a factor behind the appeal of outsider politics. If that’s the case, then we have much larger problems to consider. </p>\n<p>*Note: I’m not suggesting any of these three individuals are alike, or that Obama was a political amateur. But his ability to deliver a certain kind of speech was crucial to his rise to a presidential-level politician. </p>",

As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861862/oprah-winfrey-golden-globes-speech\">Oprah Winfrey</a> put it in her acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award on Sunday night, “Each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell. This year, we became the story.”</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Reckoning: more than 100 power brokers have been accused of sexual misconduct. Here they are.&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/a/sexual-misconduct-allegations-the-reckoning&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>Going into Sunday’s telecast, the pressure was high. Would stars merely pay lip service to gender equality in between plugging their latest projects? Or would they meaningfully address the problems plaguing their industry and American society at large? Ultimately, enough winners — most notably Winfrey herself —<strong> </strong>did the latter, allowing the Golden Globes to set a standard for the awards shows to come in what promises to be a difficult but potentially revelatory year for Hollywood and beyond. </p>\n<p>The work of changing the entertainment industry and others won’t happen on an awards-show stage, but in bringing together industry leaders in front of an enormous TV and social-media audience, such a show can give actresses and others a chance to point out problems, offer specific solutions, and galvanize their peers for the work ahead.<strong> </strong>A show can only do so much, but Winfrey and others showed what it can do.</p>\n<h3>The show got off to a predictable start, until Laura Dern raised the bar</h3>\n<p>Sunday night got off to a reasonably promising start. As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861532/black-gowns-golden-globes-red-carpet\">Vox’s Constance Grady</a> noted, red carpet interviews were more substantive than usual, as actresses got a chance to talk about their decision to wear black, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/6/16855888/golden-globes-2018-black-dress-protest-metoo\">as a protest</a> against harassment and assault. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/movies/golden-globes-2018-activists-metoo-red-carpet.html?_r=0\">activists</a> who arrived as guests of several actresses also got a chance to speak (sometimes despite the efforts of interviewers determined to focus on celebs). “We want to say to all the women who are experiencing sexual violence in the workplace, that they are not alone, that we stand with them,” said <a href=\"https://www.alianzanacionaldecampesinas.org/\">Monica Ramirez, board director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas</a>, who came with Laura Dern.</p>\n<p>The show itself, however, was at first less interesting than the red carpet. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861384/seth-meyers-golden-globes-monologue\">Seth Meyers’s opening monologue</a> had some strong moments, including a bit in which he handed off his most biting punchlines to Jessica Chastain and other actresses and actors in the audience. Meyers also<strong> </strong>gave a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/07/golden-globes-read-seth-meyerss-complete-monologue-from-weinstein-burns-to-trump-jokes/?utm_term=.a926b85956a8\">welcome shoutout</a> to Hollywood’s less visible workers: “When you’re on a film set you meet hairdressers and camera people and script supervisors,” he said. “Most of the jobs on film sets are jobs for people who work long, hard hours. They are American dream jobs.” It was a worthwhile reminder that the people affected by harassment in Hollywood aren’t all rich and famous. </p>\n<p>Early acceptance speeches were less inspiring. Elisabeth Moss, who in the past has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/25/15407972/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood-feminism\">shied away from discussing feminism</a> in <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, proclaimed in her acceptance speech for best actress in a TV drama<strong> </strong>that women “no longer live in the gaps between the stories. We are the story in print.” It was a moving sentiment, but something of a vague one. </p>\n<p>Watching the telecast’s first hour, it was easy to conclude that the night was going to feature a lot of glancing references to gender equality and sexual harassment, and not a lot of real calls for Hollywood — or anyone else — to change. Then came <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861700/golden-globes-laura-dern-2018-metoo-hollywood-harassment\">Laura Dern</a>.</p>\n<p>Dern’s speech was short, but it was specific. She called on her audience to promote <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/5/16710430/sexual-harassment-apologies-matt-lauer-louis-ck\">restorative justice</a>, an approach that seeks to repair the harm caused by misdeeds like harassment, and that deserves more attention now as workplaces and entire industries struggle to change their norms and help survivors. She also asked the assembled crowd to “protect and employ” survivors who have spoken out about harassment and abuse — far from an empty request at a time when many still fear career repercussions for coming forward. </p>\n<p>“Many of us were taught not to tattle. It was a culture of silencing and that was normalized,” Dern said. “May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture’s new north star.”</p>\n<p>This year in particular, awards shows give stars the opportunity to make demands of their industry in front of a worldwide audience, and Dern used that opportunity to the fullest.</p>\n<h3>Oprah Winfrey showed what an acceptance speech could be</h3>\n<p>Dern seemed to kick things into a higher gear, but the evening unquestionably belonged to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861862/oprah-winfrey-golden-globes-speech\">Oprah Winfrey</a>. Honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for a career that has included pathbreaking work in both journalism and entertainment, Winfrey reminded everyone watching that one of her enormous strengths is connecting with and inspiring an audience. </p>\n<p>“In my career,” she <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/08/entertainment/oprah-globes-speech-transcript/index.html\">said on Sunday</a>, “what I’ve always tried my best to do, whether on television or through film, is to say something about how men and women really behave.” Her Golden Globes speech was a commentary on how powerful men have behaved in the past and how others have endured their behavior. It was also an invitation to imagine a world in which that behavior is no longer condoned.</p>\n<p>Winfrey’s speech also wove together the intersecting problems of racism and misogyny in a way that media coverage of harassment in Hollywood, much of it focused on white actresses, has sometimes failed to do. She began her speech by describing the impact, for her, of watching Sidney Poitier win the DeMille Award in 1964. “I’d never seen a black man being celebrated like that,” she said.<strong> </strong>“It is not lost on me that at this moment, there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given this same award.”</p>\n<p>She continued with the story of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/8/16861960/recy-taylor-rape-oprah-golden-globes\">Recy Taylor</a>, a black woman abducted and raped in 1944 by six white men. Despite the investigative efforts of a young Rosa Parks, Taylor’s assailants were never punished, Winfrey said, and she “lived as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men.”</p>\n<p>“For too long,” Winfrey continued, “women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up.”</p>\n<p>Hollywood awards shows have never been particularly adept at handling the reality of intersecting social oppressions, and last night was no exception — the praise heaped on <em>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,</em> for instance, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/movies/sam-rockwell-globes-racism-cop.html\">rang oddly</a> to many who objected to the film’s portrayal of a racist police officer. “3 Billboards is about to become emblematic of how when it focuses in on its systemic misogyny Hollywood forgets that it’s also racist,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/constancegrady/status/950217514071613449\">Vox’s Constance Grady</a> wrote on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Winfrey, however, showed how inseparable misogyny is from racism, and how it’s possible, and necessary, to confront them together. Her speech also accomplished what great speeches do: it fired people up for a long fight ahead. If Dern’s speech gave Hollywood a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861700/golden-globes-laura-dern-2018-metoo-hollywood-harassment\">to-do list</a>, Winfrey’s gave it a rallying cry, as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">“Time’s Up”</a> became not just a project, but a promise. </p>\n<h3>The small moments added up</h3>\n<p>Winfrey is such an impossible act to follow that it was hard not to pity Natalie Portman and Ron Howard, who took the stage after her. But Portman made her own small stamp on the show, announcing the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/01/07/natalie-portman-savages-golden-globes-all-male-nominees-best-director/1011977001/\">men nominated for best director</a> with the quip, “and here are the all-male nominees.” It was one of many smaller moments that made the second half of the Golden Globes telecast feel like the beginning of something new.</p>\n<p>There was <a href=\"http://people.com/movies/golden-globes-2018-geena-davis-susan-sarandon-reunite/\">Geena Davis’s joke</a> that the men nominated for best actor in a drama had all volunteered “to give half of their salary back so the women can make more than them.” It would have been even better to see a winning actor actually pledge a donation to Time’s Up or another worthy cause, but maybe Davis’s dig will spur some post-awards show guilt-giving.</p>\n<p>There was <a href=\"http://people.com/movies/golden-globes-2018-barbra-streisand-disappointed-no-women-won-best-director-after-her/\">Barbra Streisand’s comment</a> that she was the last woman to win a Golden Globe for best director — 34 years ago. “Folks, time’s up!” she said. “We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director.” Notably absent from the best director category in 2018 was Greta Gerwig, even though her film <em>Lady Bird </em>won for best musical or comedy motion picture.</p>\n<p>And there was <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/reese-witherspoon-used-her-golden-globes-speech-to-promise-victims-that-shell-tell-their-stories-7813382\">Reese Witherspoon’s</a> heartfelt thank you to “everyone who broke their silence this year and spoke up about abuse and harassment.” </p>\n<p>“We see you,” she said. “We hear you. And we will tell your stories.” </p>\n<p>To make real change, Hollywood will need to do more than tell the stories of harassment and abuse survivors onscreen. It will need to support those survivors inside and outside the industry, not just with words but with legal help and job opportunities. That won’t happen at an awards show — it will happen in meetings of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">Time’s Up</a> working groups, in courtrooms, and on sets. It will happen, in many cases, out of the public eye.</p>\n<p>But a show like the Golden Globes does give members of the Hollywood elite the opportunity to hold their colleagues accountable, to demand change in front of an audience of millions who, more than ever before, are watching Hollywood power players’ every move. At their best, the Golden Globe winners and presenters did that on Sunday night. They set a tone for the other awards shows in the year ahead to follow.</p>\n<p>As Jodi Kantor, one of the New York Times reporters who broke the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html\">Weinstein story</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jodikantor/status/950210209363972097\">wrote on Twitter</a>, “Tonight’s Golden Globes felt consequential, fascinating and new. Your move, Oscars.”</p>\n<p>The Academy Awards air in two months, on March 4. By that time, we are all but sure to see more reports of harassment by powerful men. And hopefully, we’ll also see Hollywood and other industries begin to change to prevent abuse and protect survivors. The Golden Globes were a beginning. But there’s lots of work to do.</p>",

In total, the administration has set up more than 320,000 immigrants to lose their legal status over the course of late 2018 and 2019 (and possibly as many as 375,000, depending on what it decides to do with 57,000 Honduran immigrants this spring).</p>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of those immigrants have deep roots in the US. And Salvadorans might have the deepest roots of all: Approximately 192,700 US-born children have at least one parent who’s on track to lose legal status due to the administration’s Monday announcement. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration argues that the TPS program was never intended to allow immigrants to stay for 17 years, and that it needs to end temporary status to provide a “permanent solution.” But it’s unclear, at best, that the Trump administration will be interested in pushing Congress to legalize hundreds of thousands of Central American (and Haitian) immigrants. Furthermore, the administration is telling Salvadoran immigrants that they have 18 months to make other arrangements to stay in the US or pack their bags. </p>\n<p>After two decades in the US, hundreds of thousands of families will now have to decide whether to return to one of the most violent countries on earth — or remain in the US as unauthorized immigrants and try to slink into the shadows.</p>\n<h3>No president wanted to end humanitarian immigration. Then came Donald Trump.</h3>\n<p>Temporary Protected Status serves as a form of humanitarian relief, offered to nationals of countries struggling with the aftermath of war, natural disasters, or other humanitarian crises where conditions on the ground make it difficult for people to return safely. Ten countries — El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status\">are currently in the program</a>, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security and is granted in six- to 18-month intervals that can be renewed as long as DHS deems a designation necessary. </p>\n<p>El Salvador was on the TPS list in the 1990s during its long and bloody civil war, but was removed in 1992 (though a related program, Deferred Enforced Departure, protected Salvadorans from getting deported through 1995). In 2001, though, after an earthquake struck El Salvador, the government allowed Salvadorans in the US to apply for TPS again. In the intervening 17 years, it’s renewed protections 10 times.</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trump's next immigration target: people living legally in US after disaster struck their countries&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/6/16609476/tps-trump-honduras-nicaragua&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fear itself: Donald Trump's real immigration policy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/14/16293906/trump-immigration-deportation&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>To enter the program, nationals of a designated country must clear a number of conditions: They must maintain a relatively clean criminal record and pass a background check, they must pay a $495 processing fee when they first apply for the program and every time their status is renewed, and they must reside in the United States at the time of their country’s designation. This usually means that TPS beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants who were already in the US, those who overstayed a visa, or those who hold some other form of temporary immigration status. </p>\n<p>TPS beneficiaries are granted authorization to work in the US (and in some cases the ability to travel internationally) and a reprieve from deportation. But outside of that, TPS doesn’t grant many other benefits; beneficiaries do not have legal permanent resident status, and while a small number of beneficiaries may be eligible for green cards through the sponsorship of a US citizen family member, the program is not intended to provide a path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>In practice, that meant that once a country’s TPS was up for review, presidents had two choices: They could renew TPS for that country, kicking the can down the road; or they could terminate it and give thousands of people no way to stay legally in the US. </p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, most presidents chose the former. But equally unsurprisingly, the Trump administration is taking the opposite approach. With six opportunities to extend TPS over its nine months in office, it’s fully extended one of them — South Sudan — while terminating three countries’ protections on delays and offering six-month punts twice (Honduras and the initial six-month extension for Haiti).</p>\n<p>Over its first year in office, the Trump administration has made it clear that it wants to completely overhaul the basis on which the US grants legal status to immigrants. It envisions a “merit-based” immigration system in which individual immigrants are selected based on their high level of education and relevant professional skills — and the government has no obligation to let immigrants come to or stay in the US just because their homes and families are already here.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of current US immigration policies that run afoul of the Trump administration’s ideas of merit, but TPS might be the biggest affront to their vision. Not only does it extend legal protections to people based almost entirely on what’s happened in their home countries, rather than what they can contribute as individuals, but it applies to people who were already living in the US when TPS was granted — instead of allowing the US to select immigrants in advance. </p>\n<p>But the fundamental problem, from the Trump administration’s point of view, is that TPS is designed to be temporary, and a temporary program <em>shouldn’t</em> be leading people to settle in the US. </p>\n<p>To that end, the administration has taken nearly every chance it’s gotten to wind down TPS protections. In September, it announced that it was giving about 500 Sudanese a final 18 months on TPS. In November, it hit 59,000 Haitian immigrants and 2,500 Nicaraguan immigrants with the same 18-month deadline. (It was unable to come to a decision about the fate of 57,000 Honduran immigrants, forcing an automatic six-month extension, which will expire this spring.) And now it’s doing the same for what it estimates to be 260,500 Salvadorans.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"SLUG: ME-TPS PHOTOGRAPHER: NIKKI KAHN/THE WASHINGTON POST DA\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YcdHewaDtmoTIKIkXxn9ivPHe-U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9997217/97102458.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<h3>The Trump administration thinks El Salvador is too dangerous to take immigrants from, but too safe to qualify for TPS</h3>\n<p>The statute creating TPS tells the secretary to look at “conditions in the foreign state” when making decisions about TPS. The Trump administration’s review, it claims, found that El Salvador has recovered sufficiently from the 2001 earthquake to be a safe place to send hundreds of thousands of immigrants back to. And on a press call Monday, senior administration officials pointed to the “repatriation” of tens of thousands of Salvadorans from the US in recent years as evidence that the Salvadoran government can successfully reintegrate people.</p>\n<p>This is not exactly the way the Trump administration tends to describe El Salvador. The country is the home base of MS-13 — the transnational gang Trump has referred to as “monsters,” and which he and his top officials use to argue for everything from tightening asylum laws to defunding cities that don’t maximize compliance with federal immigration agents. In fact, the administration has bragged about how many MS-13 gang members it has deported to El Salvador — the very same people it’s now claiming are proof of the country’s ability to absorb returned immigrants.</p>\n<p>In 2015 (the most recent year for which data is available from United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime), El Salvador had 108.64 homicides per 100,000 people. That made it the deadliest country in the world by a wide margin — the next most dangerous, Honduras, had 63.75 homicides per 100,000 — and <em>22 times </em>as dangerous as the United States.</p>\n<p>El Salvador is slightly safer than it was in 2015. In January 2017, the country had its first day without a murder in two years. But by fall, violence was spreading again: In <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/violence-el-salvador-rise-despite-extraordinary-anti-gang-measures/\">September, </a>the country witnessed 435 homicides, or almost 15 per day.</p>\n<p>American policy has deeply shaped El Salvador’s recent past anyway. The US supported one of the sides in the civil war that led to the country’s original TPS grant. In the 1990s, efforts to deport immigrants who had been convicted of crimes played a major role in exporting MS-13 — which started as a Los Angeles prison gang — to El Salvador, where it took root. </p>\n<p>More recently, the flow of Salvadorans seeking asylum in the US, usually out of fear of violence from MS-13 or other gangs, is disproportionately made up of unaccompanied children and families — in part because of US laws offering guarantees for standards of treatment (and, in the case of unaccompanied children, options for legal status) that aren’t available to single adults. (This has been cited by some Republicans as a reason to change those laws, so as not to “incentivize” children or families fleeing violence to come to the US.)</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s line on TPS is that it’s not about the broader stability of a country, but just about recovery from the initial disaster. But the federal government has the authority to grant or extend TPS based on “ongoing armed conflict” or “other extraordinary temporary conditions.” Asked on Monday about those criteria, a senior administration official simply said it did not believe those conditions applied to El Salvador in 2018.</p>\n<h3>The Trump administration is attempting to deny — or simply ignore — that the people they’re stripping of status have deep roots in the US </h3>\n<p>It’s not even that Salvadoran immigrants are now being pushed to return to the same gang violence they fled to come to the US. By definition, every Salvadoran immigrant with TPS has been here for at least 17 years — before the homicide rate skyrocketed. As of January 2017, according to an estimate from the Center for Migration Studies, 51 percent of Salvadorans with TPS had been in the US at least 20 years.</p>\n<p>Salvadorans aren’t just the biggest population of those with TPS; they’re also the best integrated. According to the CMS estimates, 85 percent speak some English, with 48 percent speaking English “well, very well,” or exclusively. Their labor force participation rate is 88 percent — above the US average of 63 percent — and their unemployment rate is 5 percent. There are 45,000 mortgages held in the names of Salvadoran TPS holders. TPS holders make up a substantial portion (16 percent) of all Salvadorans in the US. </p>\n<p>From the administration’s perspective, all of this is a sign that previous presidents screwed up, by allowing TPS protections to continue after the initial disaster that spurred them faded into the past. But its relentlessly narrow focus leaves out a large group of US citizens: the 192,700 children who have been born in the US to at least one parent who is a Salvadoran with TPS. </p>\n<p>Most of these children are almost certainly under the age of 21 (the age at which they’d be able to sponsor their parents for green cards, under certain circumstances). Those TPS holders who were eligible for legal status have probably already gotten it — University of Kansas professor Cecilia Menjívar estimates that tens of thousands of Salvadoran immigrants got TPS in 2001 but no longer have it (presumably because they’ve gotten permanent legal status or left the country).</p>\n<p>When a reporter asked on Monday whether the Trump administration was telling parents with TPS to take their US-born, US citizen minor children to El Salvador, the senior administration official said, “We’re not getting involved in individual family decisions.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"DHS Secretary Kelly Testifies Before Senate Appropriations Committee On Budget\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Te5lFN_40l0O5lR-fLZNb5DGy9s=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9623029/688251022.jpg\">\n<cite>Mark Wilson/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>“TPS is temporary.”</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Pushing hundreds of thousands of people back into the shadows in the name of a “permanent” solution</h3>\n<p>As the Trump administration has ended TPS for country after country, it’s started to emphasize that it’s up to Congress to find a “permanent solution” to address the fate of the people it’s stripping of legal status. Because TPS was never intended to be permanent — and because it doesn’t itself provide a pathway for people to become permanent residents — the administration maintains that if Congress decides that these 260,000 Salvadoran immigrants (and the 62,000 other immigrants whom it’s stripping of TPS in the next year and a half) should stay in the US, it’s up to Congress to let them apply for green cards.</p>\n<p>There’s a difference between telling Congress to come up with a solution and actually pressuring it to do so. The administration hasn’t endorsed any bills to grant permanent status to TPS holders; the only immigration bill it has endorsed, the RAISE Act, would slash legal immigration instead of opening up new pathways for it.</p>\n<p>And, of course, the administration has already pulled a move like this before. When it announced in September it was winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Trump claimed he was giving Congress six months to find a “permanent solution” for the 700,000 immigrants protected from deportation under DACA; with less than two months left, negotiations are nearly at a standstill, in large part due to the administration’s apparent insistence on getting its entire immigration agenda passed as part of a DACA deal.</p>\n<p>If the administration really does think that a “permanent solution” that will allow Salvadorans to stay in the US is forthcoming, it’s not telling Salvadorans that. The purpose of delaying the end of TPS by 18 months, the administration says, is to give current TPS holders time to adjust to permanent status if eligible — and to make arrangements to leave the US if not.</p>\n<p>Eighteen months may seem like a long time. But for people who’ve been in the US for 18 years — with children who’ve never lived anywhere else — that may not be nearly enough.</p>\n<p>The immigrants facing the loss of TPS have another option the administration didn’t specify (and that it doesn’t tend to acknowledge). They can remain in the US after their legal status expires, becoming unauthorized immigrants. They’d join the 11 million current unauthorized immigrants, many of whom were under little risk of deportation in the final years of the Obama administration and now have to deal with the fear of ICE apprehension on a daily basis. They’d join the other tens of thousands of immigrants who will have lost TPS and stayed. And they’ll join, unless Congress has come up with a bill in time, the 700,000 US-raised immigrants who are at risk with the end of DACA. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration says it wants permanent solutions. But in its first year, its immigration legacy has been to move more and more people into contingency and vulnerability.</p>",

It’s another to put them in the driver’s seat.”</p> <p>A few weeks ago, on a brisk December afternoon, a group of policy advocates, members of Congress, and interested citizens gathered on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC for a policy discussion. On its face, this doesn’t sound like anything special, but there was something unique about the majority of the people in the room that day: They were mostly black women. </p>\n<p>The mood was jubilant, largely because the night prior, Democrat Doug Jones <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/alabama-senate-race-winner.html\">bested </a>Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama special election, ending a 25-year losing streak for Democratic Senate candidates in the state. Exit polls <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PostGraphics/status/940795840565841922/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fidentities%2F2017%2F12%2F13%2F16772012%2Falabama-election-black-women\">showed</a> that Jones’s victory was largely due to the high turnout of black voters, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/13/16772012/alabama-election-black-women\">especially black women</a>.</p>\n<p>The event began as the results from the election were still trending on Twitter,<strong> </strong>with streams of praise for #BlackWomen’s performance in the Alabama contest. “What if we just let black women run everything?” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/molly_knight/status/940799245204017153\">read one</a> popular tweet. </p>\n<p>National political figures also weighed in. “Let me be clear: We won in Alabama and Virginia because #BlackWomen led us to victory,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/940806646036561922\">noted</a>. “Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and we can’t take that for granted. Period.” </p>\n<p>The narrative that black women “saved America” by blocking Roy Moore from the Senate<strong> </strong>with their votes was picked up in media circles, with political strategists and journalists alike swiftly moving to dissect what the Alabama performance might mean for political contests in 2018 and 2020.</p>\n<p>The December event on black women’s political influence, hosted by the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls, was timely given the major win in Alabama — but celebrating the election results wasn’t the point of the gathering. After all, in past victories, black women have seen the policy issues they supported most fall down the list. </p>\n<p>“It’s one thing to acknowledge the centrality of African-American women as the wheels of our political moment,” legal<strong> </strong>scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who moderated the event, told the audience to approving nods. “It’s another to put them in the driver’s seat.” </p>\n<p>With the beginning of a new year, especially one that will end with a highly anticipated midterm election, the Alabama result offers hope for Democrats eager to regain political power in the Trump era. </p>\n<p>But for black women, the post-Alabama moment also presents an additional opportunity, a <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/11d7ddee65324aef9611e284c0e9ebdd/Black-women-seek-rewards-from-Democrats-after-Alabama-race\">potential turning point</a> in how they are treated in political circles. Both parties have been reminded yet again that black women have been a consistently reliable bloc for the Democrats. In 2018, black women say they want to see a return on their investment. </p>\n<h3>Black organizers are helping deliver more and more crucial Democratic wins</h3>\n<p>In the weeks since the Alabama election, it’s become more clear that Democrats’ victory came from massive grassroots efforts by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/13/16767662/black-voter-turnout-alabama-doug-jones-roy-moore-senate\">black organizers on the ground</a> in Alabama.</p>\n<p>“We hit the ground running and we did the work that it took to get Doug elected,” Carissa Crayton, a Jones canvasser, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-women-doug-jones_us_5a318dede4b091ca268508c2\">told HuffPost’s Julia Craven</a> shortly after the Alabama election. “People shouldn’t disregard that and just think … we saved the day without doing any hard work, that we just magically went out and voted and that that’s all we did.”</p>\n<p>As the Atlantic’s Vann Newkirk noted in an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/sparking-an-electoral-revival-in-alabama/548504/\">article</a> examining black voter mobilization efforts in Alabama, much of the effort to turn out black voters was driven by the work of independent organizers rather than<strong> </strong>political campaigns. </p>\n<p>The most active voter outreach and mobilization efforts targeted at black voters in Alabama, including the collaborative work of groups like Woke Vote, Black Voters Matter, and BlackPAC, were driven by black women, many of whom brought years, if not decades, of political organizing experience to the contest. </p>\n<p>BlackPAC, a group which seeks to build black political power across the country, is one example. Last fall, the group launched a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/blackpac-plans-11-million-effort-to-mobilize-african-american-voters-in-virginia/2017/09/20/bd034546-9e36-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html?utm_term=.2ffaf700b441\">$1.1 million campaign</a> focused on engaging black voters ahead of Virginia’s gubernatorial election. </p>\n<p>The campaign, as BlackPAC’s executive director Adrianne Shropshire <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/will-virginia-stay-blue-it-depends-on-black-turnout-next-month/\">explained to me</a> at the time, was created due to the need for more persistent political engagement in black communities. Politicians need to “grasp the significance of the concern and anxiety that is being felt inside of communities of color,” Shropshire said, adding that black voters need to be persuaded just like swing voters in elections, an effort that requires more than a few appearances before black audiences.</p>\n<p>BlackPAC’s efforts in Virginia were successful, with an overwhelming majority of black Virginian voters, including 91 percent of black women, supporting Democrat Ralph Northam in the contest. Much of the group’s outreach model was replicated in the Alabama contest. </p>\n<p>“I think the writing is on the wall about what the path forward is for progressive politics in this country, and the path forward is through communities of color and women,” Shropshire <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/us/blacks-alabama-doug-jones-.html\">told the New York Times</a> recently. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AtWZuvOsgJfrSW8DVX4ATQb2iY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9996495/BlackwomenAlabama.jpg\">\n<cite>AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>A woman walks to join the long line to vote at Beulah Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 12, 2017. Estimates placed black women at roughly 17 percent of the electorate in the Alabama special election. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It is a sentiment that has been echoed by others working to boost black women’s involvement in elections. </p>\n<p>“My first response [to black women’s turnout in Alabama] was ‘of course,’” said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, the co-founder of Higher Heights for America, a national organization that works to get more black women involved in politics and elected to office.</p>\n<p>Peeler-Allen notes that the immense black organizing structure and resources used in Alabama, coupled with the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/13/16771638/doug-jones-roy-moore-alabama-black-voters\">controversial nature</a> of Roy Moore’s candidacy helped drive black women to the polls, even as outside observers fretted that black turnout would be depressed in the state due to supposedly low enthusiasm in the Alabama race.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>In doing so, black women built<strong> </strong>upon voting trends that have existed within the Democratic electorate for decades. Black voters in general have long been one of the most reliable voting blocs for the Democratic Party, and their share of the electorate has increased over the years. But black women have become an <em>especially </em>influential wing of the party, and their high voting rates have proved to be the difference in several recent contests. </p>\n<h3>Black women’s political influence is growing on the left, but their needs go largely ignored</h3>\n<p>A 2014 Center for American Progress <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2014/10/30/99962/women-of-color/\">report </a>found that black women represented the largest portion of nonwhite female voters, at the time making up roughly 43 percent of women of color that were eligible to vote and 13.4 percent of all women eligible to vote. </p>\n<p>The report also noted that black women’s political muscle played a crucial role in Barack Obama’s victories in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, finding that in both contests “black women turned out in such large numbers that they were actually overrepresented in the electorate,” managing to flip the overall women’s vote toward Obama even as the majority of white women, a much larger bloc, backed the Republican candidate in <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2008/11/exit-polls-how-obama-won-015297\">both</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/whats-up-with-white-women-they-voted-for-romney-too\">cycles</a>.</p>\n<p>Their strong voting behavior carried over into the 2016 presidential election, in which <a href=\"https://www.essence.com/news/politics/most-black-women-voted-for-hillary-clinton\">94 percent of black women’s votes</a> went to Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. Black women have also become key players in state politics in recent years, helping deliver the governor’s mansion to Democrats in Virginia in <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/women-voters-aren-t-monolithic-terry-mcauliffe-can-thank-black-women-for-his-win\">2013</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/local/virginia-politics/governor-exit-polls/?utm_term=.9fa776e1b859\">2017</a>, and proving to be the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2017-election/NJ\">most supportive voting bloc</a> for the winning Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>But black women’s voting power and consistent support for Democrats hasn’t necessarily translated to seeing their needs reflected in policy. Last year, a group of high-profile black women activists and politicians argued that black women voters <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/144901/democrats-taking-black-women-granted\">were being taken for granted</a> by the Democratic Party, writing in an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/open-letter-dnc-chair-tom-perez-there-s-too-much-n764221\">open letter</a> to DNC chair Perez that the party needed to better support this part of the base. </p>\n<p>“Organizing without the engagement of Black women will prove to be a losing strategy,” the letter explained. “There is much too much at stake for the Democratic Party to ignore Black women.” </p>\n<p>Last fall, a survey revealed an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/21/survey-fewer-black-women-say-that-the-democratic-party-best-represents-their-interests/?utm_term=.b5fa29d0e9d2\">11 percent drop</a> in the number of black women who believed that the Democratic Party best represented their interests, suggesting that black women may be losing faith in the party. </p>\n<p>“Black women are exhausted of continually saving people who would not do the same on behalf our issues, concerns and this nation’s democracy.” Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls and one of the signatories on last year’s letter to the DNC, said in an email. </p>\n<p>That the Alabama election saw such a high turnout from black women helped fuel the idea that black women were “saving America” with their vote, a construction that many black women writers and political analysts argued ignored the truth that black women were voting in their best interest.</p>\n<p>As Dominique Matti <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/12/14/16776564/trust-black-women-doug-jones-roy-moore\">wrote</a> for Vox in December, the suggestion that people<strong> </strong>“trust black women” in the wake of the Alabama election not only served as a tacit acknowledgement that black women weren’t already seen as trustworthy self-motivated political actors, it also failed to acknowledge the struggles that black women face that drive them to the polls. </p>\n<p>“The issue in America is not that Black women aren’t entrusted with care-taking and saving others,” Matti wrote. “The issue is that no one trusts Black women when we say that we need support the most.”</p>\n<p>And black women do need support. Black women are disproportionately affected by some of America’s most systemic crises, including police violence, excessive discipline in schools, sexual violence, and poor access to health care. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2m_ANNMVTJAiVXMzmsjlrAMTAo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9996555/CBWGEvent1.JPG\">\n<cite>Courtesy of the Office of Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ).</cite>\n<figcaption>Attendees at a panel discussion of black women’s role in policy and politics hosted by the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls on December 13, 2017.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Black women are currently three to four times more likely than white women to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth\">die from pregnancy-related complications</a>. In the 2013-2014 school year, black girls were <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-girls-7-times-more-likely-suspended_us_59b69232e4b0354e44134c6d\">seven times more likely</a> than white girls to be suspended from schools, and research has shown that by the age of 5 black girls are already <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/press-releases/Black-Girls-Viewed-As-Less-Innocent-Than-White-Girls-Georgetown-Law-Research-Finds.cfm\">viewed as less innocent</a> than their peers. </p>\n<p>When it comes to police violence, an issue that has grown in national prominence since the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, black women find themselves in facing trauma from multiple angles. Not only because women are often the ones left behind to deal with the death or injury of their loved ones (a trauma that some argue is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/slow-death-is-the-trauma-of-police-violence-killing-black-women-62264\">killing black women</a> slowly), but because black women are also <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/reminder-police-violence-is-so-much-more-than-cops-sho-1801193874\">victims</a> of physical and sexual violence at the hands of law enforcement. </p>\n<p>There are also economic issues like the pay gap, which affects black and Hispanic women <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/black-women-have-to-work-7-months-into-2017-to-be-paid-the-same-as-white-men-in-2016/\">more than other groups</a>, and the fact that in 2016, some 21.3 percent of black women lived in poverty, <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resources/women-and-poverty-state-state/\">according</a> to the National Women’s Law Center. </p>\n<p>At the December policy event in Washington, black congresswomen called for a policy agenda that would center around solutions to these problems. “[Democratic politicians] need to address those whose votes gave you an opportunity,” noted Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). “You’re bragging about 98 percent of the vote, you’re bragging about the fact that we carried Hillary in 2016, you’re bragging that you want us to be in the civic process. Now do something for that.”</p>\n<h3>Black women want more than an acknowledgement of their votes — they want a place in policymaking</h3>\n<p>The rise of the black-women-as political-savior narrative also obscures another grim reality: While black women are a crucial voting bloc capable of winning close contests, they are sorely underrepresented in seats of political power. </p>\n<p>In 2017, black women held just 3.7 percent of state legislative seats, 0.6 percent of statewide elected executive positions, and 4 percent of mayorships in the US. Nineteen<strong> </strong>seats in the US House of Representatives are currently held by black women, while a single black woman, Kamala Harris (D-CA), serves in the Senate. Collectively, black women made up just 3.6 percent of Congress in 2017, according to an <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/bw_2017_status_update.pdf\">analysis </a>from Higher Heights and the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. </p>\n<p>“Despite Black women’s proven commitment to civic engagement and activism, Black women remain underrepresented as both candidates and officeholders,” the analysis notes. </p>\n<p>Improving these numbers isn’t just a matter of getting more black women to run for office. Peeler-Allen of Higher Heights notes that black female political candidates often face significant barriers when trying to run for office, and that one of the most significant is a lack of institutional support for fledgling campaigns. In many cases, she says, black female candidates often don’t receive support from donors and party structures until much later in the process, leaving black political groups like Higher Heights and others to fill in the gaps. </p>\n<p>“A big barrier for a lot of black women candidates, [is] that they can’t even get out of the box, be considered a viable candidate or a serious candidate because power structures have already deemed what a viable candidate looks like, or who they should be,” Peeler-Allen says.</p>\n<p>When the open letter to the DNC was drafted last year, Peeler-Allen says that outlining how the party should better support candidates was just as important as highlighting the need to better reflect the policy interests of black women. Those concerns were raised again when DNC leadership met with the women behind the letter last summer. </p>\n<p>In the months since, some changes have been made. As <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/can-democrats-fix-the-party-w487160\">Rolling Stone noted in June</a>, the Democratic Party has worked to refocus itself on down-ballot races. Bustle <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/what-black-women-running-for-office-are-up-against-7591629\">adds</a> that the party <a href=\"https://thegrio.com/2017/11/09/dnc-black-voters-election-day/\">has also invested</a> in InCharge, a program that works to mobilize in black women around elections. In Alabama, the Democratic National Committee quietly funneled <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-see-road-map-for-2018-in-huge-turnout-among-black-voters-in-alabama/2017/12/13/43f927b2-e04c-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html?utm_term=.a2ad1bba7374\">$1 million</a> into efforts to engage and mobilize black, faith-based, and young voter groups, but let independent groups active in the community take the lead on voter outreach. </p>\n<p>“What worked well was entrusting people from the community that the community recognized and resonated with,” Waikinya Clanton, the DNC’s director of African-American outreach <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/13/politics/black-voters-boosted-doug-jones/index.html\">told CNN</a> after the special election. </p>\n<p>And while black political strategists and politicians told Vox that much more needs to be done to better support black women running for office, the past few months have brought some promising signs. </p>\n<p>A handful of black women won election to mayoral offices in 2017, including Vi Lyles and LaToya Cantrell, the first black women to lead Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana respectively. A crowdsourced list of black women running for public office in 2018 already <a href=\"https://www.awesomelyluvvie.com/black-women-in-politics\">has more than 100 entries</a>. And, should the campaign of former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams prove successful, this year could see the election of the country’s <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/darrensands/stacey-abrams-wants-to-be-the-first-black-woman-governor?utm_term=.ibWaPOR89#.lyzRNyE64\">first black female governor</a>. </p>\n<p>Advocates argue that serious investments that tap into the political power of black women are long overdue. But at a time of increased attacks on a number of civil rights protections, they may be even more important. </p>\n<p>“As we look at stopping the rollbacks of the last 50 years of progress that are happening at the state, local, and federal level, we need more progressive voices in legislative bodies, and in executive chambers,” Peeler-Allen says. “The best way to do that is to elect black women.” </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

The final law has the downside of invalidating the postcard promise. Interestingly, that has not caused the House GOP to drop the claim — they’ve simply rolled out a new and much dumber postcard. </p>\n<p>Here’s the new postcard they tweeted out over the weekend: </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">RT if you’re excited to have a fair and simple tax code. One that works in your favor and not against. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/2059more?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#2059more</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vTnOQg1q8X\">https://t.co/vTnOQg1q8X</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qsywzSPeQV\">pic.twitter.com/qsywzSPeQV</a></p>— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HouseGOP/status/949700868579909632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>This is a simple 17-line form. </p>\n<p>But virtually every line requires you to consult some other calculation — often with no clear instructions. On line two, for example, they don’t specify <em>which</em> savings plans are the “specified savings plans” that you are allowed to subtract or give you any indications of where you find the answer. On line six, they tell you that you can deduct your state and local taxes, but they forgot to mention that the amount you can write down here is now capped at<strong> </strong>$10,000<strong> </strong>(previously it was unlimited, though for some taxpayers the existence of the alternative minimum tax served as a de facto limit). A resident of a high-tax state unfortunate enough to actually rely on this postcard might accidentally underpay taxes and end up owing penalty fees to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Line eight, however, is the one that really gives the game away. Because they elected to actually <em>not</em> eliminate tons of small-time deductions that all have their own little constituencies, there’s no way you could come close to actually listing every conceivable deduction on a postcard. Realistically, people who want to itemize deductions are going to need to use tax prep software or consult a professional — just like they do now. They sweep all of the complexity under the rug with a vague “subtract other deductions,” but of course you can do <em>anything</em> on a postcard if you wave away all the details. </p>\n<p>After that, they’re barely even trying. You need to use a tax table (they don’t tell you where to find it) to actually calculate your preliminary tax. There’s no explanation at all of how the investment income provisions of the tax code work. Three tax credits are detailed, but their postcard doesn’t say anything about what the credits are worth, who can claim them, or under what circumstances. And for whatever reason, they just left the entire question of the tax treatment of pass-through business entities off the postcard even though it’s a centerpiece of the legislation.</p>\n<p>Or, rather, they left it off because the whole postcard idea is dumb and they didn’t bother to put much effort into it.</p>\n<h3>The whole postcard idea is dumb</h3>\n<p>For starters, an obvious problem with doing your taxes on a postcard is that you’d be putting a lot of private financial information down on a card that anyone could read, photograph, pass around, etc. </p>\n<p>Whatever you do with your taxes, you’re going to want to put the paper in an envelope. An envelope would also let you include a check (if necessary) so that you could actually <em>pay</em> your taxes, which is an important part of the process. </p>\n<p>This is presumably why the House GOP plan puts “postcard” in scare quotes. But when you look at the “postcard,” you’ll see that it doesn’t have a place for you to enter basic stuff like your name, address, Social Security number, or spouse’s name (if applicable). There’s also no signature line. Once you add all that stuff in, you see that you’re going to need a full sheet of paper — just like <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1040ez--2016.pdf\">IRS Form 1040EZ</a>, which already exists and offers most taxpayers a relatively simple way to file. </p>\n<p>More broadly, however, the way tax enforcement works is that your employer(s), bank(s), and brokerage(s) file their own paperwork with the IRS, which tells them how much money you’ve been paid, how much mortgage interest you owe, etc. That lets the IRS get a decent look at whether you’re cheating on your taxes. It also would let the IRS do what many other countries do and simply <em>tabulate what you owe and tell you</em>. It would, of course, be reasonable to let any citizen who wants to <em>challenge</em> the IRS’s calculations do so and prepare their own alternate tax return. But most of us could probably just check a box and be done with it. </p>\n<p>The reason that doesn’t happen is the tax preparation industry doesn’t want to lose clients — and they usually get an assist from Grover Norquist and other anti-tax activists who want to make the taxation process as annoying as possible. But that, rather than anything about the code itself, is what is stopping Congress from making the actual filing process easier. </p>",

DeMille award</a>.</p>\n<p>“Recy Taylor: a name I know and I think you should know too,” Winfrey said. “In 1944, Recy Taylor was a young wife and a mother. She was just walking home from a church service she’d attended in Abbeville, Alabama, when she was abducted by six armed white men, raped, and left blindfolded by the side of the road coming home from church. They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone, but her story was reported to the NAACP — where a young worker by the name of Rosa Parks became the lead investigator on her case and together they sought justice.</p>\n<p>“But justice wasn’t an option in the era of Jim Crow. The men who tried to destroy her were never persecuted. Recy Taylor died 10 days ago — just shy of her 98th birthday. She lived, as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up.”</p>\n<p>As Winfrey said, Taylor never got justice. Two all-white, all-male grand juries refused to indict the men who attacked and raped her, even though one of them confessed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/obituaries/recy-taylor-alabama-rape-victim-dead.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&mtrref=undefined\">according to the New York Times</a>. The case never went to trial, and the seven men who abducted her (six of whom raped her) — Hugo Wilson, Billy Howerton, Herbert Lovett, Luther Lee, Robert Gamble, Joe Culpepper, and Dillard York — never went to prison for their crimes.</p>\n<p>The case drew headlines in the black press and, eventually, nationwide at the time. Taylor continued speaking out for the rest of her life — even as white vigilantes tried to silence her shortly after the rape, at one point setting fire to her porch.</p>\n<p>The initial crime and its aftermath exposed an intersection of issues. First, there was a society and criminal justice system that treated white and black people differently — an issue that remains a problem today, as black people are still policed and locked up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism\">at greater rates</a>, while violent crimes in black communities are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/26/12631962/ghettoside-jill-leovy-black-crime\">more likely to go unsolved</a>. Second, there was a society and justice system that was largely indifferent to violence committed against women — another issue that is now getting far more attention as more women speak out against sexual harassment and assault as part of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo\">the #MeToo movement</a>.</p>\n<p>These two issues came together during the Jim Crow era, Soraya Nadia McDonald <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-rape-of-recy-taylor-explores-the-little-known-terror-campaign-against-black-women/\">wrote for the Undefeated in December</a>, for “a decades-long reign of white sexual terror” against black women. As historian Danielle McGuire explained in her 2010 book, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAt-Dark-End-Street-Resistance%2Fdp%2F0307389243\" target=\"_blank\"><em>At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance — a New History of the Civil Rights Movement From Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power</em></a>, “Between 1940 and 1965, only 10 white men were convicted of raping black women or girls in Mississippi despite the fact that it happened regularly.”</p>\n<p>“Taylor’s rape was not an exceptional occurrence. It was part of a continuous campaign of terror that was just as much a threat to women as lynching was to black men,” McDonald wrote in the Undefeated. “The history of black women as victims of white terror has largely been ignored, silenced and minimized, even as their quest for safety fueled their pursuit of civil rights as far back as the 1890s.”</p>\n<p>Taylor’s story shows how long these issues have persisted. She lived to nearly 100 — and for more than 70 years after six white men brutally attacked and raped her, she never saw justice. (The Alabama legislature offered <a href=\"http://blog.al.com/wire/2011/03/alabama_house_approves_apology.html\">an official apology</a> to Taylor in 2011 for failing to prosecute the men who attacked her.)</p>\n<p>Taylor’s case got renewed attention recently due to her death and the film, <a href=\"https://www.therapeofrecytaylor.com/\"><em>The Rape of Recy Taylor</em></a>, which debuted in North America last year. It was also featured in McGuire’s 2010 book.</p>\n<p>“Many ladies got raped,” Taylor said in the movie. “The peoples there — they seemed like they wasn’t concerned about what happened to me, and they didn’t try and do nothing about it. I can’t help but tell the truth of what they done to me.”</p>",

But now it looks like Trump’s lawyers are worried about a potential interview with special counsel Robert Mueller — and are seeking ways to avoid it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/initial-talks-underway-about-trump-interview-mueller-russia-probe-n835506\">NBC News reports</a> that Trump’s attorneys are in initial talks with federal investigators about how a possible interview might take place. Trump’s lawyers have suggested the president could provide written answers to Mueller’s questions instead of sitting down face-to-face with Mueller’s team. They’ve also floated the idea of not having the president take part in the interview at all. The Washington Post also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-indicates-he-will-likely-seek-interview-with-trump/2018/01/08/86100bb2-f473-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html\">reports</a> that a Trump-Mueller interview could take place within weeks.</p>\n<p>But legal experts I spoke to doubt Mueller would settle for anything less than a sit-down with Trump. “I highly doubt that Mueller will accept written questions and answers,” Renato Mariotti, who served as a federal prosecutor from 2007 to 2016, told me in an interview. “Prosecutors are interested in a subject’s responses to detailed lines of questioning without the opportunity to have lawyers carefully craft their client’s answer.”</p>\n<p>That means Trump may have no choice but to speak directly with federal investigators — and that could prove troublesome for a president who has problems with the truth. </p>\n<p>“If Trump lies during this interview, he will be guilty of a felony,” Andy Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, told me. </p>\n<h3>Mueller already knows a lot. That could spell trouble for Trump.</h3>\n<p>Trump continues to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/28/trump-repeats-no-collusion-russia-says-investigation-makes-u-s-look-very-bad/989353001/\">assert</a> that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia, and that he didn’t commit any crimes. That could lull him into a false sense of complacency during an interview with Mueller’s team.</p>\n<p>And that could be a problem for Trump, as he already has trouble keeping his Russia-related comments in order. </p>\n<p>For example, Trump originally <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/21/16795506/rosenstein-trump-mueller-russia-comey-sessions\">said</a> he fired former FBI Director James Comey because of a May 9, 2017, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/21/16795506/rosenstein-trump-mueller-russia-comey-sessions\">letter</a> co-authored by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that advocated for Comey’s dismissal. But two days later, Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia\">told</a> NBC News’s Lester Holt that he ousted Comey because of the Russia investigation.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t bode well for Trump. Experts told me that if Mueller officially requests an interview with the president, it would suggest he feels he has a full grasp of the facts and wants to weigh what he already knows against what Trump says.</p>\n<p>Here’s a small sample of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/28/16735412/trump-russia-news-investigation-2017\">what we already know</a> that’s in the public domain — knowing full well that Mueller likely knows a lot more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In June 2016, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/11/15953204/donald-trump-jr-emails-russia\">Donald Trump Jr. was offered incriminating information on Hillary Clinton</a> that a contact of his openly described as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/11/15953204/donald-trump-jr-emails-russia\">emailed back</a>, “If it’s what you say I love it.”</li>\n<li>Trump Jr. proceeded to attend a meeting in Trump Tower with Trump’s son-in-law and top campaign staffer Jared Kushner, Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, a Russian lawyer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/world/europe/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer.html\">with ties to the Kremlin</a>, a Russian-American lobbyist with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/14/15972770/rinat-akhmetshin-explained\">links to Russian intelligence</a>, and a Russian-American businessman who was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/ike-kaveladze-linked-to-money-laundering-investigation/index.html\">once investigated for money laundering</a>. (When news of all this broke in July, Trump Jr.’s story about what happened <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/11/15954012/trump-jr-emails-russia\">shifted three times</a> in a matter of days.)</li>\n<li>Trump campaign foreign policy adviser <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16571548/george-papadopoulos-guilty-plea\">George Papadopoulos</a> got a tip in April 2016<strong> </strong>that the Russian government had “dirt” in Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” (The revelation came <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16571548/george-papadopoulos-guilty-plea\">in a court document</a> that revealed Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and had begun cooperating with Mueller’s team.)</li>\n<li>We also now know that<strong> </strong>former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/1/16706534/michael-flynn-fbi-charged-deal\">lied</a> about his phone calls with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-ambassador-told-moscow-that-kushner-wanted-secret-communications-channel-with-kremlin/2017/05/26/520a14b4-422d-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html\">Kushner tried</a> to set up a secret communications channel with Kislyak; Sessions <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?utm_term=.d85a7511f2c3\">failed to disclose a meeting</a> with Kislyak when he was required to relay all contacts he had with foreign officials; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manafort-offered-to-give-russian-billionaire-private-briefings-on-2016-campaign/2017/09/20/399bba1a-9d48-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html?utm_term=.62083248d2be\">Manafort had discussed</a> the possibility of providing private briefings to a Russian billionaire while working on Trump’s campaign; and Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/28/16215710/felix-sater-trump-russia\">company explored</a> building a Trump Tower in Moscow during the campaign.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a lot Trump will have to try to explain — and do so honestly. That’s likely why Trump’s lawyers don’t want him to speak to Mueller. Trusting that a client will be able to keep his story straight and not make false statements — intentional or otherwise — during an interview with federal prosecutors is always a risky proposition, and doubly so when that client is Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Two members of Trump’s campaign — Flynn and Papadopoulos — have already <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/1/16706534/michael-flynn-fbi-charged-deal\">pleaded guilty</a> to lying to federal investigators.</p>\n<p>So for now the Trump-Mueller battle will settle around when and, more importantly, <em>how</em> the interview will take place. But it looks like there will likely be a Trump interview in the future — and that would be one of the bigger developments in the Russia probe yet.</p>",

An audacious global project called the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/5/15182142/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole\">Event Horizon Telescope </a>is currently working to piece together an image of a black hole for the first time. And if it does, it will be a remarkable accomplishment. Because as massive black holes are, they’re actually incredibly hard to see up close. </p>\n<h3>Why no astronomer has ever seen a black hole with a telescope</h3>\n<p>Black holes are born when massive stars collapse in on themselves and create a region of gravity so intense that not even light can escape its grasp. Astronomers also speculate that some black holes may have been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole\">formed</a> in the early chaotic universe after the Big Bang.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with trying to see a black hole is that even the supermassive ones (with masses millions of times heavier than our sun) are relatively tiny.</p>\n<p>“The largest one in the sky [is] the black hole in the center of the Milky Way,” <a href=\"https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/dimitrios-psaltis\"><strong>Dimitrios Psaltis</strong></a>, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, explained in an email. “And taking a picture of it would be equivalent to taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the moon.”</p>\n<p>What’s more, because of their strong gravity,<strong> </strong>black holes tend to be surrounded by other bright matter that makes it hard to see the object itself.</p>\n<p>That’s why when hunting for black holes, astronomers don’t usually try for direct observation. Instead, they look for evidence of the effects of a black hole’s gravity and radiation.</p>\n<p>“We typically measure the orbits of stars and gas that seem to circle around very dark ‘spots’ in the sky and measure how much mass is there in that dark spot,” Psaltis says. “If we know of no other astrophysical object that can be so massive and so dark as what we just measured, we consider this as very strong evidence that a black hole lies there.”</p>\n<h3>We do have indirect images of black holes, however</h3>\n<p>Some of the best indirect images of black holes come from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. “The friction and the high velocities of material forming out of a black hole naturally produces X-rays,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterdedmonds\"><strong>Peter Edmonds</strong></a>, a NASA astrophysicist and communications specialist working with Chandra, said. And Chandra is a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html\"><strong>space telescope</strong></a> specially designed to see those X-rays.</p>\n<p>For example, the Chandra observatory documented these X-ray “burps” emanating from the merger of two galaxies around 26 million light-years away.

And yes, stars — some many times more massive than our sun — are orbiting it.</p>\n<p>Star S2, which is marked in the video with a yellow line, is around 15 times as massive as our sun. That’s big. But it’s nothing compared with the black hole, which is estimated to be some <em>4 million</em> times more massive than our sun. The gravity it produces whips S2’s orbit to around 11 million miles per hour, <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0226/\"><strong>which is about</strong></a> 200 times the speed the Earth orbits around the sun. (S2 completes one orbit in around 16 Earth years.)</p>\n<p>We haven’t directly observed this black hole, but scientists suspect it’s there, because nothing else can explain the orbits of these stars.</p>\n<p>“These orbits, and a simple application of Kepler’s Laws, provide the best evidence yet for a supermassive black hole, which has a mass of 4 million times the mass of the Sun,” <a href=\"http://www.galacticcenter.astro.ucla.edu/animations.html\"><strong>explains</strong></a><strong> </strong>UCLA’s Galactic Center Group, which produced the animation.</p>\n<p>Here’s another look at the same phenomenon. This video includes 16 years of observations from the <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso0846j/\"><strong>European Southern Observatory</strong></a>.

If a large gravitational wave passed through you, you’d see one of your arms grow longer than the other. If you were wearing a watch on each wrist, you’d see them tick out of sync.</p>\n<p>When two black holes collide, they unleash a massive wave of gravitation. But by the time they reach Earth 1.4 billion years later, those waves have become very faint (like how the ripples from a stone dropped in a pond mellow out the further you get from the stone). </p>\n<p>But in the past few years, scientists have been able to listen in on these ripples with LIGO and VIRGO, huge, global experiments that can detect these tiny ripples in spacetime. </p>\n<p>Because the waves LIGO detect have a frequency that’s comparable to the range of frequencies we can hear, scientists can pump up the volume and translate them into sound. (Yes, this isn’t exactly what it sounds like, but rather an audio representation of the data. And, yes, the event would have made no noise in the vacuum of space.)</p>\n<p>Listen to them here. </p>\n<div>\n<div data-volume-uuid=\"7936e2170\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" data-volume-id=\"9216\" data-analytics-label=\"The sound of blackholes colliding|9216\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\"></div>\n</div>\n<h3>Very soon we may see an actual black hole</h3>\n<p>Because the black hole in the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A, is so relatively small, and surrounded by so much occluding material, it’s going to take a huge telescope to see it. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-hunt-for-a-black-hole-with-a-telescope-the-size-of-earth-1.21693\"><strong>According to </strong><em><strong>Nature</strong></em></a><em>, </em>it would take a telescope 1,000 times more powerful than Hubble to get enough resolution to see it.</p>\n<p>An international effort called the Event Horizon Telescope is an attempt to solve this problem. Conventional optical telescopes use bigger and bigger mirrors to see objects smaller and farther away in the universe. The Event Horizon Telescope is doing something similar: It’s creating a virtual telescope the size of the entire Earth.</p>\n<p>In April 2017, the Event Horizon team connected radio telescopes at multiple locations across the world — as far-flung as Hawaii and the South Pole — and instructing them all to look toward Sagittarius A for a few days. The network is the result of an international collaboration of <a href=\"http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/announcements/2017/2\"><strong>14 research institutions across the world</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Together, these eight telescopes have the power to “count the stitches on a baseball from 8,000 miles away,” as MIT <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2017/seeing-black-holes-and-beyond-ALMA-0404\"><strong>explains</strong></a>. The array generated such a huge amount of data that it was more efficient to fly the data from each of the telescopes to a centralized location than it would be to transfer it over the internet. </p>\n<p>Right now, the scientists <a href=\"http://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/eht-status-update-december-15-2017\">are in the midst of stitching</a> all that data together. They’re hoping the final image will show the event horizon, the boundary beyond which no light can escape. That event horizon will likely be surrounded by an accretion disc, a bright, incredibly energetic ring of matter that swirls around the black hole. It could look something like this.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hECMS1tQREfSkJnnCG99xE2DxDI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9985205/lin_2048.png\">\n<cite>Hotaka Shiokawa / Event Horizon Telescope</cite>\n</figure>",

And while Winfrey has denied harboring <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/oprah-denies-presidential-ambition-after-new-day-globes-speech\">presidential ambitions</a>, it hasn’t stopped multiple from observers from asking: Why not give #Oprah2020 a try?</p>\n<p>Winfrey, a talk show host, actress, producer, philanthropist, and all-around media heavyweight, on Sunday delivered a moving address in accepting the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16853820/golden-globes-2018-winners-list\">Golden Globes’ Cecil B. DeMill award</a> for career achievement. “I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon!” she declared in a nearly 10-minute speech in which she threaded together themes of the historical struggle for civil and gender rights, her personal story, and a mood of optimism ahead. (You can read the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861862/oprah-winfrey-golden-globes-speech\">full transcript</a> of the speech on Vox.) </p>\n<p>Winfrey’s address had more than one observer wondering whether Winfrey, 63, might have more than a television and film honor on her mind. Soon after her speech, NBC fired off an eyebrow-raising tweet reading, “Nothing but respect for OUR future president.”</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing but respect for OUR future president. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobes?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoldenGlobes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/h4hkjewu0K\">pic.twitter.com/h4hkjewu0K</a></p>— NBC (@nbc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbc/status/950172700625915904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>(On Monday, the network <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbc/status/950391488990519297\">removed the tweet</a> and said it was sent by a third-party agency in reference to a joke made during the Golden Globes monologue.)</p>\n<p>The network wasn’t the only one to pick up on the theme.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IDK if she's running, but who could count her out if she did</p>— Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/950205003951673344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Still, Ms. Winfrey could face a difficult fight for the Democratic nomination, especially against _________<br><br>It is tough to finish that sentence</p>— Alex Burns (@alexburnsNYT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexburnsNYT/status/950206534923022336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is all by way of saying I have no idea if Oprah would be a good candidate or president (no idea if she’s even contemplating running!)

She would be 65 in 2020, several years younger than President Donald Trump. And if Trump’s victory taught us anything, political experience isn’t exactly a precursor for landing the top job in the United States. </p>\n<p>With what <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/oprah-winfrey/\">Forbes</a> estimates to be a net worth of $2.8 billion, Winfrey could potentially fund her campaign on her own — not to say that she wouldn’t have plenty of eager donors. (Former Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/950341279757500416\">pointed out</a> that whoever runs for the White House in 2020 should divest their assets, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/12/9/13799904/trump-corruption-conflict-of-interest\">as President Trump has not</a>.) </p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/950206171348160512\">FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten</a> noted on Twitter, Winfrey is a popular figure. A <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2436\">2017 Quinnipiac University</a> poll found that 52 percent of American voters, including 72 percent of Democrats, view Winfrey favorably, versus 23 percent who do not, or just 7 percent of Democrats. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You could do a lot worse than the favorability ratings Oprah Winfrey posted last year...

While celebrity endorsements have historically been <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/do-celebrity-endorsements-really-matter\">relatively ineffective</a> in swaying votes, Winfrey has been the exception to the rule. </p>\n<p>Her endorsement of Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf\">is estimated</a> to have generated more than 1 million votes for Obama and increased campaign contributions and voter participation, according to research from University of Maryland economists Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore. (Still, a separate Gallup poll found that <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/102301/most-voters-moved-oprahs-endorsement-obama.aspx\">most voters</a> were not swung one way or the other by Winfrey.) </p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time Winfrey has been subject to speculation that she might try her hand at politics — or fueled that speculation herself.</p>\n<p>When asked by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-03-01/the-david-rubenstein-show-oprah-winfrey\">Bloomberg TV’s David Rubenstein</a> in early 2017 whether she’s given any thought to running for the presidency, Winfrey responded, “I never considered the question even a possibility. I just thought, ‘Oh … oh?’” She said before Trump she didn’t think she had the experience or know enough to do it. “Now I’m thinking, ‘Oh.’”</p>\n<p>In September, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/29/oprah-would-really-like-for-us-to-talk-about-her-running-for-president-in-2020/?utm_term=.60c6cd855c00\">Winfrey promoted a column</a> from the New York Post’s John Podhoretz calling her the Democrats’ best hope for 2020 from her Twitter account.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jpodhoretz</a> Thanks for your VOTE of confidence!Democrats’ best hope for 2020: Oprah | New York Post <a href=\"https://t.co/tvt82v8cMH\">https://t.co/tvt82v8cMH</a></p>— Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Oprah/status/913551310628184064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2017</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>King, Winfrey’s best friend, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/837285901063569408\">said</a> her comments to Rubenstein were “clearly a joke” and that she would never run. Winfrey herself told <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/entertainment/oprah-running-president/index.html\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> in a June podcast that she will “never run for public office.” And just because we’re talking about it today doesn’t mean the hype will last.</p>\n<p>But Winfrey’s speech has certainly generated some buzz: Searches for “Oprah 2020” are now surpassing searches for “Trump 2020” on Google.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8mtYo5WpisZU9SHbUzubJrAj4u4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9995305/Screen_Shot_2018_01_08_at_8.46.26_AM.png\">\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update: </strong>Story updated with NBC’s tweet removal and explanation.</p>",

Groups with political clout — mainly wealthier, whiter communities — have pushed policies that help white families live in heavily white areas and attend heavily white schools. </p>\n<p>We see this in city after city, state after state.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ipumbLX3SHexKNLs7QE_e11shfg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9976051/map.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>And often the attendance zones are gerrymandered to put white students in classrooms that are even whiter than the communities they live in.</p>\n<p>The result is that schools today are <a href=\"https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/brown-at-60-great-progress-a-long-retreat-and-an-uncertain-future/Brown-at-60-051814.pdf\">as segregated</a> now as they were about 50 years ago, not long after the landmark <em>Brown v.

Bradley</em>, the court ruled that school districts did not have to integrate among each other if the district lines weren't drawn with racist intent. Segregated geography, created by government policies, was thus just be recreated in our schools. As Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote in his dissent, the decision meant &quot;school district lines, however innocently drawn, will surely be perceived as fences to separate the races.&quot;</p>\n<p>This still left room for districts to make sure their classrooms weren't separated by race. But the Supreme Court put limits on that, too. In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/washington/29scotus.html\">2007 decision</a>, the court ruled that school boards can't use the race of an individual student to decide where they go to school. In the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that schools could instead use demographic data to decide where to build new schools or draw attendance zones.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNnoRKKDM0u8282crDwLoH33G0M=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934081/9.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>But even with the incredibly limited scope of this action, a huge portion of American districts are using these attendance zones to exacerbate segregation.</p>\n<p>It's important to clearly state what's happening here: </p>\n<h4>Government policies created segregated neighborhoods. </h4>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R9L-hKxEaAfgaXNd_fsmlPnQ0mg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934095/10.png\">\n</figure>\n<h4>The Supreme Court said we couldn't integrate schools across the most stratified boundaries.</h4>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7IFGLJVjY4s84AOz9hmXXPZz4uc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934099/11.png\">\n</figure>\n<h4>School districts could still ameliorate segregation within their own district.</h4>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qh-dTsnuAOL52mD2JzmtAfAJB00=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9977979/split.png\">\n</figure>\n<h4>But even then, a huge portion of districts used these school boundaries to actually further the segregation that exists in each neighborhood.</h4>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7KQ8dUyMFm32h_bS5dQrEihHYk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934105/13.png\">\n</figure>\n<h4>Meanwhile, a growing number of people are side-stepping integration efforts by attending charter schools, private schools, or even <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/27/16004084/school-segregation-evolution\">seceding from their school district</a> — all of which further segregate schools.</h4>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qKfB21vfx7HF2ga8FFwgX_WHEZ4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934109/14.png\">\n</figure>\n<h3>This is what happens to school boundaries when racial demographics shift</h3>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.clime.newark.rutgers.edu/sites/CLiME/files/Siegel%20Hawley%202013.pdf\">2013 paper</a>, researcher Genevieve Siegel-Hawley studied Henrico County Public Schools in Virginia and she found that, in this racially changing suburb, &quot;school officials responsible for the district's rezoning process failed to embrace the growing diversity of the school system and instead solidified extreme patterns of racial isolation within high school attendance areas.&quot; </p>\n<p>She cited a blog post written by a parent who lives in heavily white areas:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is clearly the hottest topic at the bus stop each day. … My first reaction was that we would just move if the schools changed to ones which we do not want to send out kids to.</p></blockquote>\n<div> <figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IInjq0MjEibT4YoMXL5h343SCMQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934111/15.png\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>This anecdote plays out on a larger scale, too.</p>\n<p>Richard's 2014 study found that districts with rapid changes in racial makeup end up having school attendance zones that are gerrymandered to further segregation. This indicates that white communities see an influx of minority families move into their neighborhoods and assume the defensive stance of fencing themselves in. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZCYnHqn605ry6TWq7MHSeRyTC0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9977989/racial_change.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>Richards also found that stable communities — ones where the demographics have stayed steady — also have high levels of gerrymandering toward segregation. &quot;It seems as if [the boundaries] have been there so long that people have sorted across them,&quot; she told me. &quot;The cusps of those boundaries are extremely strong.&quot;</p>\n<p>This means that, when the dust settles, white families insist on moving next to other white families and recreating white havens.</p>\n<h3>This is what happens when school districts try to reduce segregation</h3>\n<p>Some districts, however, are using these school attendance zones to try to reduce underlying segregation. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553557/\">2015 study by Saporito and David Van Riper</a> suggests some schools boards may be drawing irregular shapes that aren't just drawn on top of the existing segregated geography, and ultimately creating more diverse classrooms.</p>\n<p>&quot;This correlation implies (but does not prove) that some school boards adopt school zoning plans with weird shapes in order to integrate children who live in separate residential clusters within a school district,&quot; Saporito wrote to me in an email.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hjevJt00BVmDFRcvPmoi_ib3vxc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934117/17.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>And this year, researchers <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w23619\">Hugh Macartney and John D. Singleton</a> published a paper that found that school boards with members who are registered Democrats tend to create more integrated schools within their district. It's an encouraging finding — one that shows local elections can have a big impact on how inclusive our schools are.</p>\n<p>But they also found causal evidence that this integration causes &quot;white flight&quot; out of public schools.</p>\n<p>It falls in line with a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4494971\">2007 paper from Saporito</a> which shows that the children in neighborhood public schools tend to be less white and significantly poorer than the neighborhoods in which they are located. In other words, white families in diverse neighborhoods are opting out and sending their kids to private or charter schools.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IS2LRiu4Z2EkNuRiqlV3xwjLQvw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934123/18.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>It also falls in line with Monarrez's findings, which show that when students in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district were exposed to more black and Hispanic students, it caused a certain amount of white flight between 2000 and 2010.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ytY_XOrjCgaFdEOoZBvOkn9Prow=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934135/19.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>And it falls in line with the increasing number of communities who, instead of moving, are using their political power to draw new school district boundaries and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/27/16004084/school-segregation-evolution\">secede from the existing district</a>. They are essentially fencing themselves in with the people they feel belong in their community, while excluding others. </p>\n<p>In short, the way the courts have interpreted the segregation laws, white communities with political and economic clout still have quite a bit of agency to determine who their kids go to school with. And they're deciding that they only want a certain amount of diversity in their schools before they decide it's better to opt out of the system.</p>\n<h3>The maps in our heads</h3>\n<p>The maps at the top of this piece should create a sort of segregation baseline for each district. </p>\n<p>Our neighborhoods are already quite segregated, and it's important to know if school attendance boundaries are being drawn to segregate our classrooms even more. </p>\n<p>But groups that resist school rezoning often make the argument that there has been a valuable and strong community that has formed around a school. In Henrich County, Virginia, one couple <a href=\"http://stayatgodwin.blogspot.de/2009/01/\">wrote a letter</a> that read:</p>\n<blockquote><p>None of these options shows the dire need to redistrict our small group of subdivisions, but ALL of these options uproot a longstanding Godwin community, potentially split close knit relations, and rob us of a nationally recognized school and education that many of us consciously chose when we purchased our homes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This couple clearly has a map in their head of which neighborhood blocks belong in a group together, and which ones don't. It might be based on who they know, where they spend time, or what they've heard about other areas. In short, they have formed a geospatial bias based on their experiences.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTFu1UimQkVtpb8X5jTRudeQEAk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934181/20.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>But it's important for us to understand how much this country's racist history has shaped these maps that we've internalized.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite pieces of research is by Maria Krysan, a University of Illinois sociologist. In a <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2009.56.4.677?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">2009 paper</a>, she describes talking to a bunch of people who live in Chicago and asking them if they know anything about certain neighborhoods. </p>\n<p>What she found was that white respondents had a blind spot for neighborhoods that were more diverse, even if they were majority white. Meanwhile, African Americans were less likely to know about far-flung suburbs. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ut9uIP9LDCjmItcYgWATsVAk6pY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9934183/21.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>This means America's long history of socially engineering where people live has not only segregated neighborhoods and schools; it's also created maps in our heads that tell us what is familiar, what is not, what is scary, what is safe. </p>\n<p>And ultimately, we make small decisions based on these emotions that accrue into segregated neighborhoods and segregated schools.</p>\n<p>That's what makes this data and research so powerful.

For months, sexual abuse has been at the forefront of the nation’s minds, and as ground zero, Hollywood has become the somewhat unlikely face for a concerted push to change the very fabric of how society (mal)functions. </p>\n<p>In other words: The atmosphere at the Golden Globes wasn’t exactly primed for a feel-good night full of splashy accolades. By and large, however, attendees mostly came prepared to face that fact, even though the Globes are traditionally known for being one of the splashiest nights of the awards season. A week ahead of the ceremony, a coalition of more than 300 women working in Hollywood <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">announced the Time’s Up initiative</a>, which aims to combat sexual abuse in workplaces across <em>all</em> industries. Then on the Globes red carpet, most women <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861532/black-gowns-golden-globes-red-carpet\">wore black as a symbol of protest</a>; some even walked the red carpet with activists like #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to drive home the breadth of the movement. </p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The black gowns on the Golden Globes red carpet weren’t just a gimmick&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861532/black-gowns-golden-globes-red-carpet&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>And to its credit, the ceremony didn’t shy away from addressing the awful shadow looming over the room. Many of the night’s speeches <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861700/golden-globes-laura-dern-2018-metoo-hollywood-harassment\">incorporated the movement</a> in one way or another. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861384/seth-meyers-golden-globes-monologue\">Host Seth Meyers</a> even opened the evening with, “Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen,” a nod to how many powerful men in the entertainment industry have been disgraced thanks to allegations of sexual harassment and assault against them. On a night when so much could have gone wrong, the night struck a surprisingly decent, if inevitably uneven, tone. </p>\n<p>To break down how Hollywood addressed some of its deep-seated issues — as well as who actually took home the night’s trophies, for better or for worse — here are 6 winners and 5<strong> </strong>losers from one of the most memorable Golden Globes ceremonies in recent memory. </p>\n<h3>Loser: E!’s attempt to cover #MeToo with anything resembling gravitas</h3>\n<p>Look, not <em>everything</em> went smoothly, and honestly, how could it?

Between pre-show coverage rife with breathless anticipation for accessories women would wear with their black dresses, cutting off activists while asking after their more famous dates’ nominations, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861326/watch-debra-messing-interview-golden-globes-e-gender-pay-gap\">Debra Messing calling out the network</a> for being embroiled in an equal-pay lawsuit <em>while she was </em><em>being</em><em> interviewed by E!</em>, the coverage was a general mess. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, however, E! was not a harbinger of overall tone-deafness to come.</p>\n<h3>Winner: Seth Meyers</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"75th Annual Golden Globe Awards - Show\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVvs5eVzxo5ZY7_oRJRFwIY-8RQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9994589/902722652.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Photo by Paul Drinkwater/NBCUniversal via Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Meyers did about as good as he could, really.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Meyers was tasked with a near-impossible challenge in hosting this year’s Globes. If he came out of the gate too somber, he’d sink any energy the room had. If he erred on the punchier side, he might come off as too glib. </p>\n<p>But in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861384/seth-meyers-golden-globes-monologue\">a straightforward, unsparing monologue</a>, the <em>Late Night </em>host struck an impressive balance. He went hard at the men who have fallen under the weight of sexual harassment allegations, especially when he declared that 20 years from now, Weinstein would be the “first person to be booed during the ‘In Memoriam.’” He even handed the mic to a series of actors who were more qualified to land punchlines about sexism, racism, and Kevin Spacey’s alleged history of targeting minors. </p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Golden Globes host Seth Meyers nailed his monologue by letting others tell his best jokes&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/7/16861384/seth-meyers-golden-globes-monologue&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>Meyers toed a tricky line and then got the hell out of the way, appearing only briefly throughout the rest of the evening. And that’s<strong> </strong>about as much as he could have done, given the circumstances.</p>\n<p>And as a bonus: Meyers barely mentioned President Trump at all. In fact, he only ever referred to him as “our president,” in glancing references that would be difficult for even the most defensive Trump supporter to turn into a knee-jerk tweet about liberal Hollywood and its hatred of the current administration. And for that, we are truly grateful.</p>\n<h3>Winner: <em>Big Little Lies</em>\n</h3>\n<p>HBO’s mesmerizing miniseries <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/30/15129914/big-little-lies-hbo-reviews-recaps\"><em>Big Little Lies</em></a>, the big winner on the TV side, matched <em>Three Billboards’ </em>four prizes, with three acting awards for stars Alexander Skarsgard, Laura Dern, and Nicole Kidman, as well as an award for being the year’s best limited series. (We’ll get to why this is a farce in a second.)</p>\n<p>Already an Emmy behemoth and a ratings winner, <em>Big Little Lies</em> looks likely to keep scooping up awards once it arrives at the various industry awards that mark the next stage of awards season, including a few — like the Producers Guild awards — where it’s been classified as a drama series, thanks to the fact that it will have a second season coming at some point. Give or take a <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em>, it’s the biggest TV awards winner from 2017.</p>\n<p>It would be nice, however, if it wasn’t ruining the life of...</p>\n<h3>Loser: every other limited series (in more ways than one)</h3>\n<p>Hey, since <em>Big Little Lies</em> just announced a second season, about the same characters, starring the same actors, it’s really not a limited series anymore, is it? But there it was, sucking up all the prizes that might have been won by <em>Feud</em> or <em>Fargo</em> or, hell, <em>The Young Pope</em> (also on HBO!). Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon should have marched around outside the hotel ballroom where the Globes are held, holding signs reading, “CATEGORY FRAUD!”</p>\n<h3>Winner: 20th Century Fox</h3>\n<p>The Golden Globes have 14 awards for motion pictures, and a full seven of them were won by movies made by some arm of the 20th Century Fox machine. Four went to <em>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</em><em>,</em> from Fox Searchlight; two went to <em>The Shape of Water</em><em>,</em> from Fox Searchlight; and one went to <em>The Greatest Showman</em><em>,</em> from 20th Century Fox proper. Add to that two TV awards (the aforementioned prizes for Sterling K. Brown and Ewan McGregor) for 20th Century Fox productions, and you have the night’s most dominant studio.</p>\n<p>You can go beyond even that, however. Though it won no prizes, <em>The Post</em>, also a 20th Century Fox production, was nominated for six awards, and both <em>Billboards</em> and <em>Shape</em> were nominated for numerous more prizes that they didn’t ultimately win. All in all, 27 of the film nominations across 14 categories went to 20th Century Fox, a hugely dominant performance from one studio.</p>\n<p>So, naturally, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/14/16764472/disney-fox-deal-merger\">the studio’s assets are being sold to Disney</a>. Good work, Hollywood!</p>\n<h3>Loser: <em>The Post</em>\n</h3>\n<p>On paper, Steven Spielberg’s journalism blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/6/16682926/the-post-review-spieberg-streep-hanks-pentagon-nixon\"><em>The Post</em></a> looks like a major awards contender in every category, almost by default: It boasts Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep at the center of an absurdly stacked cast, and though it’s about events that took place during the Nixon administration, it’s been seen as a direct answer to the Trump administration’s assault on the free press.</p>\n<p>But though the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated the film in six categories — Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score — it lost in all of them, to three different films. And any time Meryl Streep is up for an award and doesn’t win it, that’s a little surprising.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/9/14207138/do-golden-globes-predict-oscars-academy-awards\">Since the Globes aren’t a surefire Oscar predictor</a> — and because the HFPA is a very different voting body from the Academy, which began voting on Oscar nominations two days before the Globes took place — <em>The Post</em>’s losses at the Globes don’t mean much regarding its chances at the Oscars in March. Then again, the film didn’t receive any nominations from the Screen Actors Guild, which often helps pave the way for Oscar nominations. It could still pick up steam over the next two months, but its performance at <em>The Globes</em> didn’t earn any early votes of confidence.</p>\n<h3>Winner:<em> Three Billboards </em><em>O</em><em>utside Ebbing, Missouri</em>\n</h3>\n<p>The caustic, darkly comic ballbuster <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017-in-review/2017/12/29/16792848/did-we-see-the-same-movie-last-jedi-three-billboards-detroit-wonder-woman-2017\"><em>Three Billboards </em><em>O</em><em>utside Ebbing, Missouri</em></a> walked away from the Globes with trophies in four of the six categories it was nominated in, and the most awards of any feature film of the night: The movie took the Best Motion Picture — Drama) prize, stars Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand both took home acting awards in their categories, and director Martin McDonagh won for his screenplay. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately for awards prognosticators, the Globes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/9/14207138/do-golden-globes-predict-oscars-academy-awards\">aren’t especially reliable awards predictors</a>. Last year, the winner of the Globes’ Drama prize, <em>Moonlight</em>, did end up winning Best Picture, and the awards’ big winner <em>La La Land</em> also performed well at the Oscars. But the overall match rate between the Drama winner at the Globes and the Oscars Best Picture winner is still less than 50 percent.</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;Did we even see the same thing?&quot; How we watched and talked about movies in 2017&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/2017-in-review/2017/12/29/16792848/did-we-see-the-same-movie-last-jedi-three-billboards-detroit-wonder-woman-2017&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>Oscars aside, <em>Three Billboards</em> is also a controversial win. Though <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri\">a sizable swath of critics and audiences</a> have praised the film, it’s garnered some vociferous criticism for offering an oblivious outsider’s perspective on the American Midwest (McDonagh is Irish), and it’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017-in-review/2017/12/29/16792848/did-we-see-the-same-movie-last-jedi-three-billboards-detroit-wonder-woman-2017\">particularly bad in how it handles issues of racism and police brutality</a>. On a night when violence against women was being discussed and decried from every corner, the praise for the film made some sense — but its tone-deafness on race lines up with a bigger trend of focusing on predominantly white victims in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017-in-review/2017/12/21/16776708/2017-womens-anger-womens-march-reckoning-handmaids-tale-alias-grace-big-little-lies-three-billboards\">a year driven by women’s anger</a>.</p>\n<h3>Loser: women directors</h3>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THE MOMENT NATALIE PORTMAN SNAPPED <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobes?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoldenGlobes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GFgIakIaxK\">pic.twitter.com/GFgIakIaxK</a></p>— mean plastic (@meanpIastic) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meanpIastic/status/950211760086179840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>During a night of pointed statements about gender in Hollywood, Natalie Portman may have needled the most. In presenting the award for Best Director alongside Ron Howard, she slipped in some pointed commentary: “And here are the all-male nominees.” (Howard responded with nervous laughter.)</p>\n<p>Portman’s characterization was perfectly accurate — and the lack of women nominees became even more clear when Barbra Streisand took the stage to present the Best Motion Picture (Drama) prize and noted that she is the <em>only</em> woman to have ever won Best Director, for <em>Yentl</em> in 1984.</p>\n<p>Though Hollywood’s record in hiring women directors leaves much to be desired, 2017 featured a number of great films directed by women, three of whom were considered to have awards season potential: Patty Jenkins for <em>Wonder Woman</em>, Dee Rees for <em>Mudbound</em>, and Greta Gerwig for <em>Lady Bird</em>. (<em>Battle of the Sexes</em>, for which Emma Stone was nominated for a Globe, was also co-directed by a woman, Valerie Ferris.) Two of these films, <em>Mudbound</em> and <em>Lady Bird</em>, have been major players in awards conversations thus far, and <em>Lady Bird</em> won the Globes’ Best Motion Picture Comedy prize. Gerwig in particular has been in contention for Best Director prizes from critics’ groups throughout the end of the year, including winning that honor (along with Best Screenplay and Best Picture) <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-lady-bird-national-society-film-critics-20180106-story.html\">the day before the Globes by the National Society of Film Critics</a>.</p>\n<p>But the HFPA nominated an all-male slate of directors: Guillermo del Toro (<em>The Shape of Water</em>), Martin McDonagh (<em>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</em>), Christopher Nolan (<em>Dunkirk</em>), Ridley Scott (<em>All the Money in the World</em>), and Steven Spielberg (<em>The Post</em>). Del Toro won it in the end. </p>\n<h3>Loser: the Golden Globes’ reputation for being hip and with-it when it comes to TV</h3>\n<p>In the past, the Globes often led the way when it came to the TV prizes, awarding new series that the Emmys often weren’t hip enough to touch. </p>\n<p>But due to the way TV’s awards calendar is increasingly turning the spring into the medium’s equivalent of Oscar season — the better to qualify at the last minute for the Emmys — the Globes (which take the full calendar year into account) increasingly have to follow the lead of the Television Academy, as they did in rewarding both <em>Big Little Lies</em> and <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>.</p>\n<p>At least Amazon still has the Globes’ number, and the HFPA got to be the first awards body to give prizes to <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> and its star Rachel Brosnahan. About which...</p>\n<h3>Winner: streaming networks</h3>\n<p>Though <em>Big Little Lies</em> was the big winner of the night on the TV side, there was a quieter, sneakier winner just off to the side — the big three streaming networks, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. Indeed, the only TV awards not won by <em>Big Little Lies</em> or a streaming network were two of the three Best Actor prizes, with Sterling K. Brown of NBC’s <em>This Is Us</em> winning the Drama Series acting prize and Ewan McGregor of FX’s <em>Fargo</em> winning the Limited Series acting prize.</p>\n<p>But beyond that, the other TV awards went to Hulu’s <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> (Drama Series and Elisabeth Moss for Actress in a Drama Series), Amazon’s <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> (Comedy Series and Rachel Brosnahan for Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series), and Netflix’s <em>Master of None</em> (Aziz Ansari for Actor in a Musical or Comedy Series). This wasn’t the world-shaking dominance of <em>Big Little Lies</em> (which won four awards all on its own), but it was a sign of the way the TV tides are turning.</p>\n<p>Will this last forever? Probably not. HBO, FX, Showtime, or some other TV network can always land a Globe-dominating project starring lots of British people (the Globes’ forever secret love), but for now, streaming networks have their finger on the pulse of what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association wants.</p>\n<h3>Winner: Oprah Winfrey</h3>\n<div>\n<div data-volume-uuid=\"eea86998b\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" data-volume-id=\"35169\" data-analytics-label=\"Oprah Winfrey Golden Globes Speech|35169\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>If the overriding theme of the night was Hollywood’s attempts to reckon with the horrible actions exposed by the #MeToo movement, then it only seems fitting to give the last word to Oprah Winfrey, winner of the Globes’ Cecil B.

DeMille award</a> for career achievement, a speech that started with Winfrey reminiscing about being a young girl in 1964, watching Sidney Poitier become the first black man to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, and then took listeners through a lifetime spent watching other people fight for justice, some very publicly and some without their names ever becoming known.</p>\n<p>“They’re the women whose names we’ll never know,” Winfrey said. “They are domestic workers and farmworkers. They are working in factories and they work in restaurants and they’re in academia, engineering, medicine, and science. They’re part of the world of tech and politics and business.”</p>\n<p>She linked those women, who put up with horrible treatment from powerful men, with her own mother, who worked hard cleaning the houses of other people, in order to make sure that her daughter might go on to become a worldwide name, a talk show host, and an Oscar nominee. </p>\n<div>\n<div data-volume-uuid=\"b3cd5d5eb\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" data-volume-id=\"35168\" data-analytics-label=\"Oprah Winfrey honors Recy Taylor at the Golden Globes|35168\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>And then she linked those women to the story of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/obituaries/recy-taylor-alabama-rape-victim-dead.html\">Recy Taylor</a>, a black woman whose brutal rape at the hands of six white men in Alabama spoke to a time when men were, too often, not held accountable for their actions. (Though the men who raped<strong> </strong>Taylor admitted to their actions, two grand juries failed to indict them.) Taylor died 10 days ago, at 97.</p>\n<p>But Winfrey, being <em>Oprah Winfrey</em>, didn’t leave listeners without hope, pivoting, masterfully, to the idea that for the powerful who are not held accountable, “Time is up.” She’s been central to the founding of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">Time’s Up movement</a>, designed to help create an equitable landscape where women’s reports are taken seriously.</p>\n<p>Winfrey has always been great at translating the experiences of singular people to a larger struggle for justice, for recognition, or just for something more, and her Globes speech was a terrific reminder of how beautifully she can turn her story, or Sidney Poitier’s story, or Recy Taylor’s story, or your story, into every story. Her speech is worth reading in full.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 1964, I was a little girl sitting on the linoleum floor of my mother’s house in Milwaukee watching Anne Bancroft present the Oscar for best actor at the 36th Academy Awards. She opened the envelope and said five words that literally made history — “The winner is Sidney Poitier.” </p>\n<p>Up to the stage came the most elegant man I ever remembered. His tie was white, his skin was black — and he was being celebrated. I’d never seen a black man being celebrated like that. I tried many, many times to explain what a moment like that means to a little girl, a kid watching from the cheap seats as my mom came through the door bone tired from cleaning other people’s houses. But all I can do is quote and say that the explanation in Sidney’s performance in <em>Lilies of the Field</em>, amen, amen. Amen, amen. </p>\n<p>In 1982 Sidney received the Cecil B. DeMille award right here at the Golden Globes and it is not lost on me that at this moment, there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given this same award. It is an honor — it is an honor and it is a privilege to share the evening with all of them and also with the incredible men and women who have inspired me, who challenged me, who sustained me and made my journey to this stage possible. Dennis Swanson who took a chance on me for <em>A.M. Chicago</em>. Saw me on the show and said to Steven Spielberg, she’s Sophia in <em>The Color Purple</em>. Gayle who’s been a friend and Stedman who’s been my rock. </p>\n<p>I want to thank the Hollywood foreign press association. We know the press is under siege these days. We also know it’s the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice — to tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies.</p>\n<p>I want to say that I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times, which brings me to this. What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. And I’m especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories. Each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell, and this year we became the story. </p>\n<p>But it’s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry. It’s one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics, or workplace. So I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they, like my mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They’re the women whose names we’ll never know. They are domestic workers and farm workers. They are working in factories and they work in restaurants and they’re in academia, engineering, medicine, and science. They’re part of the world of tech and politics and business. They’re our athletes in the Olympics and they’re our soldiers in the military.</p>\n<p>And there’s someone else, Recy Taylor, a name I know and I think you should know, too. In 1944, Recy Taylor was a young wife and mother walking home from a church service she’d attended in Abbeville, Alabama, when she was abducted by six armed white men, raped, and left blindfolded by the side of the road coming home from church. They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone, but her story was reported to the NAACP where a young worker by the name of Rosa Parks became the lead investigator on her case and together they sought justice. </p>\n<p>But justice wasn’t an option in the era of Jim Crow. The men who tried to destroy her were never persecuted. Recy Taylor died 10 days ago. Just shy of her 98th birthday. She lived as we all have lived too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up. Their time is up. </p>\n<p>And I just hope -- I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth, like the truth of so many other women who were tormented in those years, and even now tormented, goes marching on. It was somewhere in Rosa Parks’s heart almost 11 years later, when she made the decision to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery, and it’s here with every woman who chooses to say, “Me too.” And every man — every man who chooses to listen. </p>\n<p>In my career, what I’ve always tried my best to do, whether on television or through film, is to say something about how men and women really behave. To say how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage, how we fail, how we retreat, persevere, and how we overcome. I’ve interviewed and portrayed people who’ve withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during our darkest nights. </p>\n<p>So I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say “Me too” again. Thank you. </p>\n</blockquote>",

Traditionally, a red carpet is a frothy celebration of fashion — albeit usually safe and sedate fashion — and celebrity gossip: “Look at what that actress is wearing.” “Oh, I didn’t know that pop star was married to that actor.” It’s best watched with wine firmly in hand and pizza waiting on the coffee table. </p>\n<p>But this year, in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, celebrities walking<strong> </strong>the red carpet didn’t have the space to be quite so frivolous. They had to acknowledge the systemic misogyny of the entertainment industry and at least pay lip service to making a difference going forward — and, with the Golden Globes being a Hollywood event, they had to do so while being self-congratulatory and glitzy.</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How do you cover red-carpet fashion during #MeToo?

It’s like someone says, there’s no prerequisites to worthiness. You’re born worthy, and I think that’s a message a lot of women need hear. The women who are still in silence because of trauma, shame due to assault. They need to understand that it’s not their fault and they’re not dirty. That’s my message tonight.”</p>\n<p>The black dresses provided an opening to use the enormous platform of the red carpet to talk about sexual harassment and assault — and while the red carpet may not be the best place to have that conversation in a substantive way, it’s a <em>great</em> place to have it in a loud and impactful way. You can’t address all the nuances, but you can send your message to millions of viewers watching at home.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"NBC's '75th Annual Golden Globe Awards' - Red Carpet Arrivals\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJ9_dfsPQ-zDV6RSTobV8SntDzg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9993705/902355982.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Trae Patton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>And not for nothing, since <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/5/16853610/golden-globes-red-carpet-fashion-fug-girls-me-too-times-up-jessica-morgan-heather-cocks-interview\">red carpets <em>are</em> for fashion along with everything else</a>, the black gowns en masse looked less like a symbol of mourning and more like a showcase of minimalist glitz. They also gave Hollywood’s finest the chance to show off their tailoring, giving celebrity and fashion junkies a chance to play. Black gowns show fit like nothing else, so just for a night, all the elaborate status plays and semiotics of Hollywood fashion were confined to fit and line, like a secret code.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">for example, viola is tailored like royalty, that dress fits down to the centimeter seam</p>— rachel syme (@rachsyme) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/950168434851053570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>The black gown movement also seems to have prompted some of Hollywood’s most famous actresses of color to wear their hair in natural or traditionally African styles. Viola Davis had combed her hair out into a full and glorious Afro, and Tracee Ellis Ross donned a dramatic black silk headscarf. At the Golden Globes, where hair is traditionally heat-styled within an inch of its life, statements like that are downright dramatic.</p>\n<h3>Activists were invited to spread their message on one of the world’s biggest platforms</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Moet &amp; Chandon At The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards - Inside\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJUMdWyDDAyM7Gb_2ipCRDezQmI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9993897/902371304.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Moet &amp; Chandon</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Eight of the actresses who attended the Golden Globes — Laura Dern, Amy Poehler, Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, Emma Watson, Michelle Williams and Shailene Woodley — <a href=\"http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/g14774201/actress-activist-red-carpet-golden-globes/\">brought activists with them</a> onto the red carpet. Throughout the night, they redirected their interviews back to their dates, sometimes seemingly against the will of their interviewers.</p>\n<p>“We want to say to all the women who are experiencing sexual violence in the workplace, that they are not alone, that we stand with them,” said Laura Dern’s date <a href=\"https://www.alianzanacionaldecampesinas.org/\">Monica Ramirez, board director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas</a>, as E! minimized her talking face and brought it to the bottom of the screen, the better to focus on a just-arriving Saoirse Ronan. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It’s so infuriating to watch E! shift focus from women like Tarana Burke and Monica Ramirez.

We’re here because of Tarana,” said Michelle Williams, who was on the red carpet with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/us/me-too-movement-tarana-burke.html\">Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement</a>. “You may think we’re here because I was nominated for something, but that’s really not the case. We’re here because Tarana started a movement, and she planted a seed years ago and it’s grown and caught fire. She started the #MeToo movement.”</p>\n<p>“It’s deeply humbling,” said Burke. “This is something I started out of necessity and something that I thought my community needed and it’s grown over the years, but I never could’ve envisioned it growing like this. But this moment is so powerful because we’re seeing … collaboration between these two worlds that people don’t usually put together and would most likely have us pitted against each other.”</p>\n<p>The move gave women activists one of the biggest platforms in the world — and it also effectively prevented the red carpet extravaganza from focusing on the romantic entanglements of movie stars. Savvily, the actresses who invited protesters to the red carpet were able to both push the #MeToo conversation forward and to present themselves to the world as serious, politically minded professionals rather than unserious, objectifiable romantic objects.</p>\n<p>The Golden Globes red carpet faltered more than once and was far from an unmitigated success. But given the very narrow path it had to walk to success, with little room for error on either side, it managed much better than anyone expected it to. </p>",

Laura Dern got specific.</p> <p>In the first hour of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/2/16841912/golden-globes-2018-winners-nominees-moments-protests\">Sunday’s Golden Globes telecast</a>, many Hollywood luminaries addressed sexual harassment, gender inequality, and the #MeToo movement. But nobody did it like Laura Dern.</p>\n<p>Dern began the acceptance speech for her supporting actress win by thanking her co-stars on HBO’s <em>Big Little Lies</em>, the show’s producers, and creator David E. Kelley — who, she said, had given her the role of Renata Klein, “a terrified mother, terrified because her little girl was being abused and bullied and she was too afraid to speak up.” Then came the pivot:</p>\n<p>“Many of us were taught not to tattle. It was a culture of silencing and that was normalized. I urge all of us to not only support survivors and bystanders who are brave enough to tell their truth, but to promote restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>It became clear that Dern wasn’t just going to reference the recent moment of reckoning in Hollywood and across other industries — she was going to offer specific recommendations. More than anyone who took the stage before her, she was going to take the opportunity she was given to call her industry to account.</p>\n<p>After calling for the promotion of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/5/16710430/sexual-harassment-apologies-matt-lauer-louis-ck\">restorative justice</a> — an approach that seeks to repair the harm done to survivors and the surrounding community — she asked that her audience of filmmakers “protect and employ” survivors who have broken their silence. And, she added, “May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture’s new north star.”</p>\n<p>While many women and men at the Globes had talked about the importance of women’s stories, Dern was one of the first to make a pointed call for Hollywood to support the people who have changed American culture in the past few months by speaking publicly about harassment, assault, and abuse. And she called not just for moral support but for material support, in the form of employment. </p>\n<p>As the women of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">Time’s Up</a> have made clear, Hollywood as an industry has a lot of work to do, both in cleaning its own house and in offering support to survivors around the country. Others on Sunday night had gestured toward the work ahead, but Dern went further. She gave Hollywood’s power players a to-do list, a way to back up their words with money and opportunities and, maybe, create real change.</p>",

How would he toe the line between entertaining the room and making light of the horrific systemic sexism that came to light in the fall of 2017, when allegations of sexual harassment and assault <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/6/16431674/harvey-weinstein-allegations-explained\">broke against Harvey Weinstein</a> — and then, one after another, many other male Hollywood titans?

He’s also proven himself to be more openly willing to admit when he, a straight white guy, can’t speak to certain experiences the way, say, his women writers can. So on <em>Late Night</em>, Meyers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/9/16627924/seth-meyers-hillary-clinton-jokes\">regularly features</a> a segment called “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell,” in which he hands off the punchlines to writers Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel (who are black and gay, respectively). </p>\n<p>And so toward the end of his Golden Globes monologue — which relied solely on punchlines instead of soft-shoeing his way through a song-and-dance number — Meyers brought “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell” to the Golden Globes, setting up jokes and then handing off the punchlines to more fitting people out in the audience. </p>\n<p>“The Golden Globes turns 75 this year…” Meyers began.</p>\n<p>To which actress Jessica Chastain responded with a deadpan eyeroll, “...[but] the actress who plays his wife is still only 32.” </p>\n<p>Then Meyers threw this setup to comedian Billy Eichner: “<em>Call Me </em><em>b</em><em>y Your Name</em> is nominated for Best Motion Picture. It’s a gay coming-of-age film —”</p>\n<p>“— said Kevin Spacey,” Eichner interrupted, “‘you lost me at ‘of age.’”</p>\n<p>Meyers went on to congratulate <em>Insecure</em> creator and star Issa Rae for having “three projects in development” with HBO — to which Rae responded, “yeah ... and three projects is also where they think I’m <em>from</em>.”</p>\n<p>For <em>Downsizing</em> actress Hong Chau, Meyers began, “According to a recent article, only 5 percent of speaking roles in Hollywood are played by Asian actors —”</p>\n<p>“— but those numbers might be off,” Chau interrupted, “because a white person did the math.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Meyers tried to hand off a punchline to Amy Poehler, a former Golden Globes host and Meyers’s former <em>SNL</em> Weekend Update co-anchor. But Poehler, faux outraged at the idea that she would need a man’s help to make a joke at all, went ahead and delivered the punchline sans setup (“Said the peach in <em>Call Me </em><em>by</em><em> Your Name</em>, this scene is the pits!”).</p>\n<p>As Meyers himself acknowledged, this was a year that might have been better served by having a woman host. But if it was going to be a man cracking jokes about systemic sexism and inequality in Hollywood, at least the gig went to one who knows when to hand the duty off to those more intrinsically capable of landing the punchlines.</p>",

Debra Messing started the Golden Globes off with a bang by calling them out.</p> <p>While walking the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/2/16841912/golden-globes-2018-winners-nominees-moments-protests\">2018 Golden Globes</a> red carpet, which promises to be filled with acknowledgments of the systemic misogyny of Hollywood that range from cringingly awkward to deeply powerful, Debra Messing started things off with a bang.</p>\n<p>In an interview with E!’s Giuliana Rancic, Messing took the opportunity to speak out against E!’s <a href=\"http://people.com/tv/catt-sadler-leaves-e-news-pay-gap-cohost-jason-kennedy/\">recently revealed history</a> of gender discrimination. </p>\n<p>“I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn’t believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts,” Messing told Rancic, adding, “I miss Catt Sadler … and we stand with her.”</p>\n<p>Sadler, the longtime co-host of <em>E! News</em>, left the network in December, citing the massive pay gap between her salary and that of her male co-hosts.</p>\n<p>“It really has been a dream job. Literally a dream job,” <a href=\"http://people.com/tv/catt-sadler-leaves-e-news-pay-gap-cohost-jason-kennedy/\">Sadler told People magazine at the time</a>. “It’s like a family here and it’s been beautiful for the majority of my run. I pinch myself every day the job that I get to do. I have so much fun. It has almost been surreal.”</p>\n<p>But Sadler left her dream job behind, she said, after she was “informed and made aware that my male equivalent at the network who I started with the same year and have come up with doing essentially similar jobs, if not the same job, wasn’t just making a little bit more than me but was making double my salary and has been for several years.”</p>\n<p>Sadler said that when she attempted to renegotiate her salary to match that of her male co-star, E! refused to meet her number. (In a statement to People, E! said, “E! compensates employees fairly and appropriately based on their roles, regardless of gender. We appreciate Catt Sadler’s many contributions at E! News and wish her all the best following her decision to leave the network.”)</p>\n<p>Messing’s interview is a reminder that E! won’t be able to hide from its history of gender pay discrimination — even when it’s supposed to be doing the interviewing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Later in the evening, Eva Longoria added to the call-outs in her own interview with E!, saying, “We support gender equity and equal pay, and we hope that E! follows that lead with Catt as well. We stand with you, Catt.”</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Eva Longoria piles on E!: &quot;We support gender equity and equal pay, and we hope that E! follows that lead with Catt as well.

The episode went on to win Waithe an Emmy for Comedy Writing — making her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/17/16324446/emmy-milestones-records-glover-handmaids-tale-veep\">the first black woman to do so, <em>ever</em></a>. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Waithe was developing her own drama. In creating, writing, and producing <em>The Chi — </em>premiering tonight on Showtime — Waithe has made an empathetic love letter to the South Side of Chicago, the place she grew up that has become a frequent target of oblivious disdain.</p>\n<p>And when the new year rolled around, Waithe was announced as one of the 300 women in Hollywood who’ve come together to form <a href=\"https://www.timesupnow.com/\">Time’s Up</a>,<strong> </strong>an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">initiative</a> to combat sexual harassment and workplace abuse across multiple industries that has already raised $15 million to act as a legal fund for victims who want to fight back against abusive situations, but are unable to do so on their own.</p>\n<p>The supportive structure of Time’s Up goes hand in hand with Waithe’s personal ethos. As she told me in an interview at Showtime’s press tour for <em>The Chi</em> — held the day before the Golden Globes, where Waithe and many other attendees will be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/6/16855888/golden-globes-2018-black-dress-protest-metoo\">wearing black in support of the #MeToo movement</a> — she has no interest in basking in her own success without offering a ladder to other marginalized voices who need help in order to get where she is now. </p>\n<p>“We’re going to put our money where our mouths are to help make sure new writers’ projects have the funding and the development they need before they get taken out to the market,” Waithe said. Through her own production company, she hopes to encourage potential buyers to shift their perspective from “We want to be in the Lena Waithe business!” to “Lena Waithe has great taste!”</p>\n<p>“[I’d like them to say] ‘This is a really cool young writer, this person might be the next Lena Waithe.’ I hate that, but I know how this business works,” Waithe said. “So for me, I want to go, ‘There’s some mini-me’s out there, there’s mini-Donalds [Glover], mini-Justins [Simiens], there’s mini-Issas [Rae]’ … I don’t want to take <em>all</em> those opportunities. I want to spread those out.”</p>\n<p>Read on for more, straight from Waithe, on why she finds it so important to bring others up with her, why her new show <em>The Chi</em> means so much to her, and what she hopes Time’s Up can accomplish. </p>\n<p><em>The following</em><em> interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></h4>\n<p>So you’re here for your own show, which must be weird and pretty cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly! It’s a unique experience. I’m used to coming here with a band, you know what I mean? It’s like when Beyoncé comes with Destiny’s Child and she’s flanked, and then she goes solo. [laughs]</p>\n<p>It’s a huge accomplishment for me to have my first show that’s created by me and written by me, and for it to be a drama is also kinda fun. It gives people a broader sense of who I am and my voice. I feel like they got an idea of who I am, and I think <em>The Chi</em> will kind of surprise them a little bit. </p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></p>\n<p>Has <em>The Chi</em> been in the works for a long time, or was it inspired more recently? Is this the kind of show you’ve always wanted to do?</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe </strong></p>\n<p>I wrote it like three years ago, and people took to it. It’s funny, I never looked at it like, “This is it, this is gonna be the thing.” I’d also written a half-hour [comedy] a year or two prior … I’m close to getting that going, which I’m really excited about. It’s loosely based on my twenties, moving to LA and being a queer brown girl and all that goes with that. </p>\n<p>But I’d written [<em>The Chi</em>] because I’m from Chicago, and I feel like black men are being dehumanized so much. I know the stories coming out of the city, which are all true, and these are things we should be dealing with. But there’s also human beings that are living in that city who are just trying to make an honest living, and raise their kids, and go to church when they can. I just kind of feel like people weren’t seeing them as human beings. Dick Wolf is covering the firefighters and the police officers and the lawyers and all that kind of stuff [on his trio of NBC shows, <em>Chicago Fire</em>, <em>Chicago PD</em>, and <em>Chicago Med</em>], and I’m just like, I don’t care about the system. I care about the people the system affects. </p>\n<p>That’s really where <em>The Chi</em> came from. I was also reading a lot of [James] Baldwin at the time, and he wrote so beautifully about [black people] in his prose and stories that were fictitious, but felt like they were about real people. That was really my mission with the show: to show us as a normalcy. </p>\n<p>I know [<em>The Chi</em> is] constantly getting compared to <em>The Wire</em>, because it’s a show about a bunch of black people. But luckily, since you’ve seen some of it, you can say, “Nah, it’s not at <em>all</em>.” The Wire was <em>all</em> <em>about</em> the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></p>\n<p>So many Chicago-based stories say the same things over and over again. What did you want your show to get right that they get wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>Just the humanity, and the <em>real</em>, you know? We curse. We smoke. We have sex, with people we sometimes shouldn’t be having sex with. We have a real sense of spirituality, even when we’re lost. And we’re always searching, always pondering and thinking where we want our lives to go. “Why am I here? What am I doing?” We cry. We pray. </p>\n<p>Those things, I don’t think people know how we do them. And I know very well, because I was that girl, I was that person. I <em>am</em> that person. That’s what we wanted to show. </p>\n<p>Which, again, it shows my being so influenced by Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Lorraine Hansberry. You can look at [Hansberry’s] <em>A </em><em>Raisin in the Sun</em> today and have a clear understanding of what the black experience is, because Lorraine does such a beautiful job of taking a specific thing — that just happened to be in Chicago, and just happened to have a character named Lena in it — and be so eloquent, and so honest, and so raw. </p>\n<p>A white dude couldn’t write that play. Couldn’t. A white dude shouldn’t have <em>rewritten</em> that play! [Playwright Bruce Norris wrote the 2010 play <em>Clybourne Park </em>as a spinoff to <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>.] ‘Cause it would look and feel different, and wouldn’t have had the longevity it had. Same thing with something like <em>The Color Purple</em>; you read that book and Alice Walker’s words about what it means, or Baldwin’s <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>. These works of art have lasted so long because it’s people talking about <em>their</em> people. </p>\n<p>Even like Spike Lee’s stuff; people look at things like <em>School Daze</em> and <em>Do The Right Thing</em>, which is him holding up a mirror to us. But it’s okay if <em>he’s</em> holding up the mirror versus someone else, who’s an outsider. So for me, it was like, I wanted to tell our story from the inside looking out, versus from the outside looking in. </p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></p>\n<p>It’s from a lived-in experience, and there are already so many lived-in white experiences on TV.</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>Oh my god, yeah. And it’s that in movies too, you know what I’m saying? I wish there was a black <em>Lady Bird</em>, I wish there was a black <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>. Some people might say that was <em>Moonlight</em>, and I’m like, the thing is, there’s a <em>Call Me By Your Name </em>every year. We get a <em>Moonlight</em> every once in a blue moon … and that speaks to privilege. I love <em>Lady Bird</em>, and I love <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>, because I’m a black person who just loves great art. But I can’t help but look at them and go, “Agh, I wish we got a black version of this every year!” </p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></p>\n<p>It’s true that we get lots coming-of-age stories that look very similar. </p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>You do. </p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></p>\n<p>I remember after <em>Moonlight</em> came out, Barry Jenkins said on the New York Times podcast <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/magazine/barry-jenkins-on-life-post-oscars.html?_r=0\"><em>Still Processing</em></a> that he wished more people would ask him about the filmmaking more, and not just the politics of the movie, since he put so much of himself and what he had learned from film into it. I’m sure you’re about to get a stream of very similar questions about <em>The Chi</em>. Is there one you wish you’d get asked more?</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>“Who are some television writers that influenced and inspired you?” Not TV shows: <em>writers</em>. Because that gives me an opportunity to talk about <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266088/?ref_=nv_sr_3\">Susan Fales-Hill</a>, who was the original showrunner of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092339/\"><em>A Different World</em></a>, and helped to shape it and make it what it was. Or <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000739/?ref_=ttfc_fc_dr1\">Debbie Allen</a>, the person who directed all those episodes and really worked closely with Susan to help give that show an identity. And <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101465/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr3\">Yvette Lee Bowser</a>, who worked with them and went on to create <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106056/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><em>Living Single</em></a> and a bunch of other shows, who’s now showrunning [Netflix’s] <em>Dear White People</em>. They also hired <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697656/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Gina Prince-Bythewood</a> — who went on to create <em>Love and Basketball </em>and all these different things — as a writers’ apprentice on <em>A Different World</em>. </p>\n<p>I just want an opportunity to talk about these amazing television writers. People like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1618213/?ref_=nv_sr_4\">Wendy Calhoun</a>, who wrote on <em>Empire</em>; <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0283234/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Ayanna Floyd</a>, who wrote on <em>The Chi</em> for a little bit but is just a legend in the game. Even <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262558/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Bentley Evans,</a> who was a part of making <em>Martin</em> what it was, and again, giving it an identity; <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103488/?ref_=nm_knf_t3\"><em>Martin</em></a> was a huge deal, those first couple seasons are pitch perfect. You go back and watch that first season of <em>Martin</em>, and it’s like, <em>wow</em>. They were doing something unique, and fresh, and raw, and special. </p>\n<p>Just these amazing writers who are often behind the scenes, and you don’t know their names, you wouldn’t recognize them if they walked by you on the street. But they’re really important, and very important to my journey. So I’d just like to say these writers’s names, because often you don’t get an opportunity to. People just ask, like, “What made you want to write this?” And it’s like, well, what made me want to write [<em>The Chi</em>] is because I’m a black person and I wanted to tell the story, but the truth is, a lot of us are affected by those that came before us. </p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve been really open about wanting to use your success to bring up other people in the entertainment industry, to make it more of a ladder. How do you hope to do that?</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>I know so many phenomenal writers who happen to be people of color, who happen to be part of the queer community, who happen to be trans. I want to make sure they have an opportunity as well. Because the more stories we have, then we <em>will</em> start getting some black <em>Call Me By Your Names</em>, we will start getting some Latino versions of <em>Lady Bird</em>. It’s really important that they have a platform. And pretty soon, that list of brown people the industry goes to for everything will get longer, and longer, and longer. The playing field will be leveled, and that’s my mission: to level the playing field.</p>\n<p>It ain’t going to happen in a day, it ain’t going to happen in a week. It’s going to take a long time, and a lot of me going out there, shaking hands, reading scripts, developing material. That’s what I can do, is make sure I’m being a soldier and I’m at the forefront — and being a protector as well of these young voices. Their spirits can easily be broken by this town. So my mission is to protect them to make sure they have what they need to have a long, lovely, amazing career and be up on as many Emmy and Golden Globe and Oscar stages as possible, because they deserve to be there as well. </p>\n<p><strong>Caroline Framke </strong></p>\n<p>You recently became a part of the Time’s Up initiative. There’s so much to focus on with that, because, y’know, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/a/sexual-misconduct-allegations-the-reckoning\">things are bad <em>everywhere</em></a>. What are your priorities with the movement? What are you hoping Time’s Up can do that maybe hasn’t happened before?</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe</strong></p>\n<p>I think the biggest thing is just to create a barrier around not just women, but anyone who’s <em>othered</em> in any way, shape, or form — to make sure they have a place to go or someone to call if they’re in an uncomfortable place or abusive situation. They need a line of defense, and I think Time’s Up really has the potential to be that. </p>\n<p>My spirit is rejuvenated when I leave these meetings. I’m sitting there with all these amazing people — from actresses to producers to directors to execs — and we’re talking about ways to create a support system, ways to be helpful, ways to educate each other on things the other may not know. It’s really, really great. And I think it’s about time this sort of thing was formed, and I’m so proud to be a part of it. I will proudly be wearing black at the Golden Globes. I hope that everyone understands that what we’re doing is really for the greater good. </p>\n<p>People will go, “Are you nervous to talk about this?” And it’s like, no, there’s no way to spin this into a bad thing! If they do, that’s their conscience, and they can deal with that. But at the end of the day, it’s all good. There’s nothing bad that can come out of this. Nothing.</p>\n<p>The Chi <em>premieres January 7 at 10 pm on Showtime.

The measure exchanges investments for visas: Through the program, foreigners are eligible to apply for a green card if they invest half a million dollars into a commercial enterprise in the United States.</p>\n<p>According to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-looks-into-kushner-cos-use-of-eb-5-program-for-immigrant-investors-1515240181\">Wall Street Journal</a>, which cited people familiar with the matter, Kushner Cos. Received a subpoena from the SEC in May 2017 requesting information about its use of the program. It also received a separate subpoena from New York federal prosecutors asking for information about its development projects funded partly by the visa program.</p>\n<p>Both probes came after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/business/trump-kushner-china-investors-visas.html?mtrref=www.google.com\">reports emerged</a> that the Kushner family was using the prospect of US visas to woo Chinese investors. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-a-beijing-ballroom-kushner-family-flogs-500000-investor-visa-to-wealthy-chinese/2017/05/06/cf711e53-eb49-4f9a-8dea-3cd836fcf287_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.a69eeb6855d9\">The Washington Post</a> attended a presentation delivered by Nicole Kushner Meyer, Jared Kushner’s sister, telling a room of wealthy Chinese investors in Beijing that for a $500,000 investment they could immigrate to the United States — namely, to a New Jersey luxury apartment complex the family was developing. </p>\n<p>“It’s incredibly stupid and highly inappropriate,” Richard Painter, the former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told the Post at the time. It appears federal agencies have taken note and are acting accordingly. </p>\n<p>Prosecutors are specifically focused on a development of two 66-floor commercial and residential towers called One Journal Square, located in Jersey City, NJ. The company’s general counsel, Emily Wolf, told the Journal that the company “utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations, and did nothing improper.” Kushner Cos. is cooperating with legal requests.</p>\n<h3>The program Kushner’s using has been in place for over 25 years</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/eb-5\">EB-5 program</a>, created in 1990 under President George HW Bush, offers green cards to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in certain US businesses, which are required to create or preserve 10 permanent full-time permanent US jobs per investor. According to US Citizen and Immigration Services, the program is intended to “stimulate the US economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors.” (Vox’s Dara Lind has a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/8/15578060/eb-5-kushner-trump-china\">great explainer</a> on the ins and outs of the EB-5 program.) Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/politics/kushner-china-visa-eb-5.html\">signed legislation</a> renewing the program in 2017.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20Annual%20Report%202017_0.pdf\">Department of Homeland Security</a>, EB-5 visas are awarded disproportionately to immigrants from China.

He has sold his personal stake in some projects but has maintained them in others.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time Kushner has found himself in hot water in recent months over his business or political activities.

Snakes. Connie Britton staring into the middle distance. And that’s just episode one.</p> <p><em>Every week, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can </em><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/episode-of-the-week\"><em><strong>read the archives here</strong></em></a><em>. The episode of the week for December 31, 2017, through January 6, 2018, is the pilot for </em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7235466/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">9-1-1</a><em>, Fox’s new drama about emergency first responders.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fox.com/9-1-1/\"><em>9-1-1</em></a>, the new Fox drama that debuted January 3 with strong ratings, approaches the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614682/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Ryan Murphy</a> event horizon.</p>\n<p>Murphy, one of the most powerful producers in television, has become known for his ridiculous plot twists and boundary-pushing<strong> </strong>willingness to take stories just about anywhere — sometimes to his detriment. That makes it all the more surprising that he would co-create (with longtime collaborators <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1004299/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Brad Falchuk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591101/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Tim Minear</a>) what amounts to a network procedural about emergency first responders. </p>\n<p>But watch the pilot of <em>9-1-1</em>, and the attraction of Team Murphy to this material becomes clearer. Instead of just one case of the week, Murphy, Falchuk, and Minear include several, all of which are as nuts as possible but also drawn from real events. </p>\n<p>The old knock against Murphy was that he couldn’t stay focused on a single storyline for a whole season. He would endlessly reboot shows like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624/?ref_=nm_knf_t1\"><em>American Horror Story</em></a>, sometimes from episode to episode, even though they ostensibly reset their stories with brand new characters and situations in every season. But <em>9-1-1</em> amplifies that approach even more. It’s a Ryan Murphy series that switches storylines with <em>every scene</em>. And, to be honest, it kinda works?</p>\n<h3>\n<em>9-1-1</em> traps a baby in a wall and a woman’s neck in a snake, and that’s just in the first two-thirds of its running time</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"9-1-1\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7JxuA_RXpbmjbktyXnNUv_SSHc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9991513/911_S1_101_SCN38_RF0543_hires2.jpg\">\n<cite>Fox</cite>\n<figcaption>9-1-1’s cast is full of incredible actors you’ll know from elsewhere, including Krause (center), Aisha Hinds (third from left) and Angela Bassett (right).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The moment when I knew I was going to watch an embarrassing amount of <em>9-1-1</em> came when a firefighter raised an axe to break open a wall, and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0470244/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Peter Krause</a>, playing fellow firefighter Bobby Nash (what a great firefighter name!), barked, “Stop! Did you even stop to consider that you might hit a baby!”</p>\n<p>Now, to be fair to the show, Bobby doesn’t believe that most walls contain babies. He’s become convinced that a faint cry he can hear behind the wall (after a 911 caller reports hearing said faint cry) is a prematurely born infant who’s been flushed down the toilet and is now stuck inside the pipes of an apartment building — something that not only apparently <em>can</em> happen but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C9yWv0gv00\">actually <em>has</em></a>. </p>\n<p>Even though this has actually happened, something about the hyper-kinetic presentation of such a horrifying situation ramps it all the way up until it approaches a wild Venn diagram intersection between horror and camp. It’s completely ludicrous, but the commitment on display from everybody involved, from the writers to the actors to director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1267896/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Bradley Buecker</a>, sells it in such a way that it becomes hard to look away from. </p>\n<p>As more and more of the show’s characters become involved in the story, racing through the apartment complex to make sure nobody flushes their toilet and drowns the child, <em>9-1-1</em>’s pilot embraces the kind of tonal whiplash that might be the hallmark of Murphy’s work. This is a deeply serious situation, certainly, but it’s also treated with such heightened emotion that you can’t help but laugh for a moment, before letting yourself be sucked in.</p>\n<p>Once the baby scene concludes, the show immediately dives into a story about a young woman who’s being suffocated by one of her snakes, before concluding with a more standard home invasion setup, meant to ping our heartstrings as the series’ central 911 dispatcher (played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0110168/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Connie Britton</a>) attempts to keep a little girl alive after robbers break into her home. The sequences reminded me of an even more revved-up <em>ER</em>, which would famously tell entire stories about patients who came in to the hospital in need of medical treatment in the space of about five minutes.</p>\n<p>But where <em>ER</em> was able to confine its medical action to the titular location in most episodes, <em>9-1-1</em> is constantly jetting all over Los Angeles, to the degree that it can feel like <em>Chicago Fire</em>, <em>Chicago Med</em>, and <em>Chicago PD</em> have been collapsed into the same series, with a framing device featuring Connie Britton answering the phone. It’s amazing the show doesn’t feel more overheated than it already does.</p>\n<p>But maybe that’s the true promise of <em>9-1-1</em>: Tune in for a surprisingly top-flight cast (which also includes <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000291/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Angela Bassett</a>!); stick around for what feel like entire episodes of television collapsed into individual scenes or sequences. It’s almost a return to Murphy’s roots, when his first big hit, FX’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361217/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><em>Nip/Tuck</em></a>, took the standard medical case-of-the-week show and wedded it to a bacchanal of flesh and gore, itself hitched to a satirical wink about America’s obsession with youth and beauty.</p>\n<h3>The show’s emergency stories are wildly entertaining. But its interpersonal stories need work.</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"9-1-1\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KhCVKXesdNI2Y_myxCLbUbNYNk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9991519/911_S1_EP101_Scs6_7_8_9_10_0067_hires2.jpg\">\n<cite>Fox</cite>\n<figcaption>The story featuring Connie Britton’s 9-1-1 dispatcher and her mother is the one interpersonal story that sort of works.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>When <em>Nip/Tuck</em> was at its height in its first two seasons, it centered on the unusual relationship between Christian Troy and Sean McNamara, two plastic surgeons whose medical practice evolved into a sort of twisted brotherhood. (Both men seemed to be in love with Sean’s wife, Julia.) When the show began to fall apart, it was because the series struggled to find ways to tell stories outside of that basic interpersonal setup. </p>\n<p>And right away, <em>9-1-1</em> establishes interpersonal stories for all of its characters that feel far more labored than any of the actual emergency situations the characters attempt to resolve. In particular, Bassett’s character, a police sergeant named Athena Grant, is dropped into the middle of a story in which her husband — with whom she has two children — comes out to their kids as gay, and his semi-closeting is revealed to have been part of some sort of long-term arrangement between the two spouses.</p>\n<p>The series attempts to port its overheated emergency stories into its personal scenes, with huge levels of melodrama, but it doesn’t work very well. The closest any of the interpersonal stories comes to success is when Britton’s character, Abby, attempts to deal with her mother’s descent into Alzheimer’s, mostly because her story is so much quieter than everything surrounding it.</p>\n<p>Following the personal lives of the<strong> </strong>cops and firefighters at the center of shows like this has been happening since at least 1981’s game-changing <em>Hill Street Blues</em>, but such shows generally require a deft touch to balance the life-and-death stakes of an emergency situation against the smaller (but still important) stakes of the character stories. <em>9-1-1</em> doesn’t have that touch just yet, but everything else about its pilot made me realize that I would watch several more episodes just to see if the show can find it.</p>\n<p>9-1-1 <em>airs Wednesdays at 9 pm Eastern on Fox. Previous episodes are available on Hulu.</em></p>",

The accusation came early in a long custody battle between Allen and Farrow’s mother, Mia Farrow. The couple never married but had adopted two children together, Dylan and Moses. They also had a biological son, Ronan Farrow, who is now one of the investigative reporters who helped bring to light accusations of sexual assualt against Harvey Weinstein. </p>\n<p>Dylan Farrow’s accusations kicked off years of controversy and acrimonious accusations against Allen, complicated by the fact that Allen left Mia Farrow for one of her other children, her daughter Soon-Yi Previn, and married Previn in 1997.</p>\n<p>Those accusations died down after the custody battle ended, but were revived after the Golden Globes honored Allen with the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2014. In response, Dylan Farrow wrote a blistering open letter, published on February 1, 2014 <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/?action=click&contentCollection=Opinion&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article\">by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof</a>, that not only reinforced her allegations from 1992 but called out those who continued to work with her father:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?</p>\n<p>Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dylan Farrow, along with her brother Ronan, has continued to speak out against Allen, most recently in a December 7 LA Times op-ed entitled “<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-farrow-woody-allen-me-too-20171207-story.html\">Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?</a>” </p>\n<p>And she isn’t alone. Though some of Hollywood’s most well-known actors have continued to defend or at least remain neutral on Allen — most <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/features/kate-winslet-wonder-wheel-woody-allen-1202595654/\">notably Kate Winslet</a>, during the press tour for Allen’s latest <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/11/28/16692006/wonder-wheel-review-woody-allen-oedipus-rex\">eyebrow-raising film <em>Wonder Wheel</em></a> — a small but steady stream of people has recently begun to speak publicly about Allen, with some expressing remorse over working with him. </p>\n<p>Several actors have made statements about their work with the director. In October, Griffin Newman, who appears in Allen’s upcoming 2018 film, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/tick-actor-griffin-newman-regrets-working-with-woody-allen.html\">voiced his regret</a> and pledged his salary to RAINN, an organization that works to combat sexual assault and violence. In November, Ellen Page called her work with Allen on his 2012 film <em>To Rome, With Love</em> <a href=\"http://people.com/movies/ellen-page-woody-allen-regret/\">one of her “biggest regrets.”</a> And on January 6, David Krumholtz tweeted that working with Allen on <em>Wonder Wheel </em>was “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrDaveKrumholtz/status/949382267738185728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avclub.com%2Fajax%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-949382267738185728%26autosize%3D1\">one of my most heartbreaking mistakes</a>.” </p>\n<p>Krumholtz’s confession came in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/i-read-decades-of-woody-allens-private-notes-hes-obsessed-with-teenage-girls/2018/01/04/f2701482-f03b-11e7-b3bf-ab90a706e175_story.html?utm_term=.0c0afbc755b6\">searing piece</a> by the writer Richard Morgan, published in the Washington Post on January 4, that detailed a pattern of obsession with teenage girls in the writings in Allen’s archives.</p>\n<p>In her pre-Golden Globes tweets, Farrow voiced both support for the #TimesUp movement and hope that this time, efforts to fight harassment and abuse in Hollywood will matter — that change is truly coming to Hollywood.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, four years later, it is Globes Sunday again and many, if not most, will be wearing black on the red carpet in solidarity with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIMESUP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TIMESUP</a> movement.

Plus: Bannon apologizes for his role in <em>Fire and Fury</em>. </p> <p>On Sunday, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller dropped by Jake Tapper’s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/07/white-house-adviser-stephen-miller-full-interview-sotu.cnn\">CNN studio</a> to appear on <em>State of the Union</em> and defend his boss, President Donald Trump, from allegations made in the hottest new political book in the country — Michael Wolff’s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB077F4WZZY%2Fref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</em></a>, a gossipy look at the fledgling administration’s first act. Miller was there to trash the book and its sources, namely Steve Bannon, ousted from the Trump Train and recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/bannon-mercer-trump.html\">spurned</a> by his original patrons, the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/4/7/15105712/donald-trump-jane-mayer-robert-mercer-steve-bannon-republican-party\">Mercers</a>. Bannon’s appearance in Wolff’s book as a main voice was a betrayal. This week, the president released a statement <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16845920/trump-michael-wolff-book-steve-bannon\">slamming Bannon</a>, whom he said “lost his mind.” (Later on Sunday, Bannon told <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-bannon-sends-regret-to-trump-1515329924-dbfe9439-59e0-4773-8d3d-079e5ee2b493.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic\">Axios</a> he regrets much of the contents of the Wolff book.) </p>\n<p>Miller did his job well: <em>Fire and Fury</em> was “a work of very poorly-written fiction,” and Wolff a “a garbage author of a garbage book;” Bannon’s participation was “tragic” and “unfortunate.” </p>\n<p>“It’s tragic and unfortunate that Steve would make these grotesque comments so out of touch with reality and obviously so vindictive,” Miller told Tapper. Miller sought to distance himself from the Breitbart News chairman, who had in fact helped him get a job with Trump in the first place. (Miller said that it was actually former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski who helped him get in with Trump.) According to Miller, Bannon’s role in the Trump presidency has been “greatly exaggerated.” </p>\n<p>The aide then lavished praise on the president, describing Trump as a “political genius” — which echoed Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/6/16857492/trump-tweets-mental-health\">self-characterization</a> on Twitter the day before. For Miller, Trump is a “self-made billionaire, who revolutionized reality TV, and who has changed the course of our politics.” </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller says of his experience with President Trump during the campaign: &quot;I saw a man who is a political genius&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNNSOTU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CNNSOTU</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XS79MYOuIp\">https://t.co/XS79MYOuIp</a></p>— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/950006712425119744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>During the conversation, Miller repeatedly called Tapper “condescending” and accused CNN of “24 hours of negative, anti-Trump, hysterical coverage” that has led to “spectacularly embarrassing false reporting” from the network. CNN and other networks have committed a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/cnn-trump-error-journalism-287914\">handful of reporting errors</a> in recent months and weeks, but these pale in comparison to the continuous stream of lies that pour from the White House.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just give me three minutes to tell you the truth about the Donald Trump that I know and that all of our campaign staff knows?” Miller asked.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s my show, and I don’t want to do that,” Tapper replied.</p>\n<p>The pair continued to talk over one another until Tapper told Miller to “settle down.”</p>\n<p>Miller refused to answer serious questions about the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/trump-comey-firing-letter.html\">New York Times report</a> that special counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading the Russia investigation, has in his possession a letter outlining the president’s reasoning for firing former FBI Director James Comey — which Miller reportedly had a hand in drafting. The aide also distanced himself from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/18/15990798/trump-jr-russia-meeting-attendees\">Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russians</a> in June 2016, then declined to weigh in on growing questions over the president’s mental stability. It should go without saying that Miller’s performance was aimed squarely at Trump, but Tapper said it anyway. “There’s one viewer that you care about right now and you’re being obsequious,” Tapper said near the end of the segment. </p>\n<p>Tapper finally cut Miller off. “You’re being a factotum in order to please him,” Tapper said. “I think I’ve wasted enough of my viewers’ time. Thank you Stephen.” </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Watch the exchange that led to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jaketapper</a> cutting off Stephen Miller this morning <a href=\"https://t.co/OhGbmzBH5z\">https://t.co/OhGbmzBH5z</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6vHIjKUZV8\">pic.twitter.com/6vHIjKUZV8</a></p>— Axios (@axios) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/axios/status/950016962859536384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>It appears, however, that Miller accomplished his mission.

I would happily do with less.”</p>\n<p>Still, Colbert continued, Trump is “president of the United States. There’s no escaping him. [Trump fatigue] is like having oxygen fatigue.” Which is why, he explained, he’s so grateful to have the outlet of <em>The Late Show</em> — and soon, <em>Our Cartoon President</em>:<em> </em>It allows him to vent his outrage with a similarly frustrated audience. “I have this great thing where I get to go out to the audience and we have this shared catharsis to laugh at, Colbert said. “If I didn’t have the show, I’d be much more tired of the president. It keeps it fresh, to be able to laugh at the devil.”</p>\n<p>With <em>Our Cartoon President, </em>Colbert and the show’s producers are aiming for a slightly different approach to Trump-centric humor by focusing on the “interpersonal relationship comedy” constantly unfolding within the administration. (Though both Omarosa and Steve Bannon — whom the show’s creative team had previously planned to include as integral characters, had to be scrapped following their respective <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/18/16145188/steve-bannon-fired-resigns\">sudden exits</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/13/16773148/omarosa-trump-white-house-drama\">from the White House</a>.)</p>\n<p>But even with so much chaos at his disposal to mine for comedy, Colbert insisted that at the end of the day, he would much rather have a little more normalcy at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, because, “here’s the thing: I love my country more than I love a good joke.”</p>",

They’ve also drawn up plans for a zombie apocalypse.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cdcgrandrounds/archives/2018/January2018.htm\">staging a training session</a> on January 16, titled “Public Health Response to a Nuclear Detonation” — and given the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/18/16733560/north-korea-war\">rising tensions</a> between the United States and North Korea, the event seems eerily well-timed. The “grand rounds,” as they’re called, will focus on what federal, state, and local public health programs have done to prepare for a nuclear detonation. The event is aimed at health professionals, but members of the public <a href=\"http://time.com/5089633/cdc-nuclear-war-grand-rounds/\">will be able to watch</a> via livestream. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cdcgrandrounds/archives/2018/January2018.htm\">CDC’s website</a> describes it like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While a nuclear detonation is unlikely, it would have devastating results and there would be limited time to take critical protection steps. Despite the fear surrounding such an event, planning and preparation can lessen deaths and illness. For instance, most people don’t realize that sheltering in place for at least 24 hours is crucial to saving lives and reducing exposure to radiation. While federal, state, and local agencies will lead the immediate response efforts, public health will play a key role in responding.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A spokesperson for the agency told <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cdc-plans-session-on-the-medical-response-to-a-nuclear-detonation/\">Scientific American</a> that the event has been underway for months, noting that CDC officials took part in a “radiation/nuclear incident exercise” led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) earlier this year. In New York City, the operation was coined “<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/2017/04/20/operation-gotham-shield/\">Gotham Shield</a>.” And indeed, it is the CDC’s job to prepare for the worst, even if that means dressing the worst as a zombie apocalypse. Really. </p>\n<p>In 2011, the CDC and FEMA <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/blog/2011-05-19/cdc-preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse\">rolled out a plan</a> to help Americans prepare for a zombie apocalypse: They outlined recommendations for putting together supplies — including food, water, and medication — and emergency planning about what to do and where to go in the event that zombies happen. In 2012 FEMA hosted a <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1913-25045-3339/20130430_final_zombie_preparedness_transcript.pdf\">zombie preparedness webinar</a>, and the CDC still has an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombie/index.htm\">entire website</a> dedicated to the matter. </p>\n<p>While the zombie apocalypse guidelines might be silly, it’s actually a clever way to get Americans to pay attention to a topic that’s less fun: knowing what to do in a major disaster. CDC communications head Dave Daigle told <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/why-did-the-cdc-develop-a-plan-for-a-zombie-apocalypse/239246/\">the Atlantic</a> in 2011 that the idea was born out of a search for new ways to get people to prep for hurricane season. “We have a great message here about preparedness, and I don’t have to tell you that preparedness and public health are not the sexiest topics,” he said. “I thought it would get more pickup if I used zombies.” Very true. </p>\n<p>All that said: It’s important to prepare for the worst, especially if the worst comes to seem increasingly likely. That goes as much for the effects of climate change on extreme weather as it does for Trump’s nuclear rhetoric. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!</p>— Donald J.

The president also said he’d be open to speaking with Kim Jong-Un, the North Korean leader himself. “I always believe in talking,” he said. Don’t start building a bomb shelter just yet. </p>\n<p></p>",

The president addressed a range of issues, including his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/6/16857492/trump-tweets-mental-health\">early-morning Twitter rant</a>, his immigration proposals, and talks between North Korea and South Korea. At one point, Trump also called his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn — who has long been rumored to be contemplating leaving the White House — to the microphone to declare, “I’m happy.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s “proper” comment came in response to a question about a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/4/16852150/report-trump-anger-sessions-russia-investigation\">report</a> published in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> on Thursday, which said Trump had enlisted the White House counsel, Don McGahn, to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Trump believed it was Sessions’ job as attorney general to protect him. “Everything that I’ve done is 100 percent proper,” Trump said. He held that the Times report was “way off, or at least off,” though he declined to say in what way. “You’ll find out,” he said. He took about 10 minutes of questions. </p>\n<p>Others attending the Camp David retreat with Trump spoke as well — Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Sessions did not attend. </p>\n<p>Here are the highlights.</p>\n<h3>On the Michael Wolff book: “It’s a disgrace.”</h3>\n<p>Trump called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB077F4WZZY%2Fref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</em></a> by media writer Michael Wolff a “disgrace” and “work of fiction.” The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">salacious book</a> describes the events of Trump’s first months in office and has clearly roiled the president; multiple excerpts were published before its official release on Friday. Since then, Trump has derided Wolff <em>and</em> former top strategist Steve Bannon. (The Breitbart News chairman was clearly a major source for Wolff.)</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book. He used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad! <a href=\"https://t.co/mEeUhk5ZV9\">https://t.co/mEeUhk5ZV9</a></p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949498795074736129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>President Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/06/trump-boasts-that-hes-like-really-smart-and-a-very-stable-genius-amid-questions-over-his-mental-fitness/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_pp-trumptweets-832am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.3d0050e846a3\">said</a> Wolff, who interviewed him in 2016 for a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/donald-trump-conversation-politics-dark-898465\">Hollywood Reporter</a> profile, “does not know me at all” and insisted Wolff’s claim that he spoke with Trump for a total of three hours during his campaign and after was a lie. Initially, Trump said Wolff had never interviewed him but then backtracked, saying they spoke once “a long time ago” for an article. </p>\n<p>“I guess Sloppy Steve brought him into the White House a lot,” Trump said, referring to Bannon. “That’s why Sloppy Steve is looking for a job.” For his part, Wolff <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-wolff-my-insane-year-inside-trumps-white-house-1071504\">said</a> he gained access to the White House, essentially, through the president’s “non-disapproval.” </p>\n<h3>On the Times story: It’s “way off, or at least off.”</h3>\n<p>Trump on Saturday said the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html?_r=0\">New York Times story</a> about Sessions’ recusing himself from the FBI’s Russia probe was “way off, or at least off” but wouldn’t explain how. When asked how off the story was, Trump replied, “You’ll find out.” </p>\n<p>The president seemed to think Sessions failed to protect him, reportedly going so far as to ask “Where’s my Roy Cohn?” — a reference to Trump’s former attorney and fixer, a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-wolff-my-insane-year-inside-trumps-white-house-1071504\">ruthless figure</a> who served as Sen. Joe McCarthy’s top aide in his 1950s communist investigations and who died in 1986.<strong> </strong>Trump added that he’s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/06/politics/camp-david-donald-trump-jeff-sessions/index.html\">still standing by</a> Sessions, despite the Attorney General’s conspicuous absence at Camp David. “The collusion is dead,” the president told the assembled reporters.</p>\n<p>The FBI’s investigation remains ongoing.</p>\n<h3>On discussions between North Korea and South Korea: “I hope it works out.” </h3>\n<p>Next week, North Korea and South Korea <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16853700/north-korea-south-talks-olympics\">plan to hold</a> high-level diplomatic talks for the first time in more than two years. Trump’s take: “I hope it works out, I very much want to see it work out between the two countries.” </p>\n<p>Trump said he had spoken with South Korean Moon Jae-in, who “thanked me very much for my tough stance” and with whom he had a “great discussion.” He said he would like to see North Korea “getting involved” in the Pyeongchang Olympic Games which South Korea will host in February and “maybe things go from there.” </p>\n<p>Trump said Moon and others had said that “without my rhetoric, and without my tough stance, and it’s not just a stance, I mean, this is, this is what has to be done, if it has to be done that they wouldn’t be talking about Olympics, they wouldn’t be talking right now.” It is unclear how true that is. </p>\n<h3>On potential talks with Kim Jong Un: “I always believe in talking.” </h3>\n<p>Trump earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16844404/trumps-tweets-north-korea-fox-news\">tweeted</a> that he has a “much bigger &amp; more powerful” nuclear button than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — a serious Cold War-esque threat. (For the record, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/1/3/16844772/trump-north-korea-button-nuclear-taunt\">he doesn’t actually have a button</a>.) Apparently, however, the phone lines at the White House are open if the Jong Un wants to catch up.</p>\n<p>“Sure, I always believe in talking,” Trump said on Saturday when asked if he was willing to engage in phone talks with the North Korean leader. “But we have a very firm stance.”</p>\n<p>Trump went on to say that Jong Un “knows I’m not messing around, not even a little bit.” But he said if some sort of an agreement could be reached, “that would be a great thing for all of humanity, that would be a great thing for the world.”</p>\n<p>The world agrees. </p>\n<h3>On the 2018 midterms: “We need more Republicans.”</h3>\n<p>Trump said that he plans to be very involved in 2018 Senate and House races and will campaign for “whoever I have to protect,” including incumbents and “anybody else that has my kind of thinking.” </p>\n<p>He took a swipe at Bannon and failed Republican candidate Roy Moore, who lost his bid for the US Senate seat in Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones after a wave of sexual assault allegations, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/13/16643422/roy-moore-republican-party\">many of them involving teenagers</a>, surfaced near the end of the race. “We should have never lost Alabama,” Trump said, and then seemingly opened the door to bipartisan legislation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We need more Republicans, we have to have more Republicans, with that being said, I think we’re going to go bipartisan, I think we’re going to have some really great bipartisan bills, but we need more Republicans so that we can really get the rest of the make America great again agenda passed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump also took the opportunity to brag about his poll numbers, which he said “have gone way up.” </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/224849/snapshot-trump-weekly-job-approval-highest-july.aspx\">Gallup</a>, Trump’s approval rating this week reached its highest level since mid-July: 39 percent. President Barack Obama’s approval rating at about the same time in his presidency was 51 percent; President George W. Bush’s was 84 percent. </p>\n<h3>On immigration: “The wall’s going to happen or we’re not going to have DACA.” </h3>\n<p>Trump has given Congress until March to come up with legislation to save the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era law that protected some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16841954/daca-immigration-deal-trump-congress\">700,000 young people</a> from deportation. President Trump, however, clarified that there will be strings attached to any deal that might be reached: “The wall’s going to happen or we’re not going to have DACA.”</p>\n<p>Beyond calling for funding for a border wall at the US-Mexico border, for which the Trump administration is asking <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/05/politics/border-security-billions-trump-wall/index.html\">$18 billion</a>, the president also called for an end to “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/29/16504272/chain-migration-family-how-trump-end\">chain migration</a>” — immigration to the United States that happens based on family ties — and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/11/2/16591118/diversity-visa-explained\">visa lottery system</a>, a diversity-boosting program for people without US relatives.</p>\n<p>“We all want DACA to happen, but we also want great security for our country,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>When asked about his continued call for Mexico to pay for the wall, despite all evidence pointing to the fact that American taxpayers will eventually foot the bill, Trump reiterated that he thinks that Mexican check will still somehow come through. “In some form, Mexico will pay for the wall,” he said. It doesn’t seem likely — Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has consistently said Mexico has no plans to pay for the wall. </p>\n<h3>Gary Cohn on his feelings: “I’m happy.”</h3>\n<p>National Economic Council director and former Goldman Sachs chief operating officer Gary Cohn has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/gary-cohn-isnt-going-anywhere--for-now.html\">long been subject</a> to speculation that he might soon leave the White House. Midway through his speech, though, Trump said that he’s sticking around — and brought Cohn up to the microphone to prove it.</p>\n<p>“If he leaves, I’m going to say that I’m very happy that he left,” Trump joked as Cohn approached the podium. </p>\n<p>“Are you happy, Gary? We just passed a very big bill, I think he’s pretty happy,” the president said, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/20/16790040/gop-tax-bill-winners\">Republican tax bill</a>, passed in December.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I’m happy. How’s that?” Cohn said.</p>\n<p> </p>",

In recognition of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/11/29/16712514/me-too-feminist-backlash-weinstein-effect\">#MeToo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/2/16840882/times-up-harassment-hollywood-metoo\">#TimesUp</a> movements, many attendees have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/movies/times-up-golden-globes-red-carpet.html\">committed to wearing black to the Globes</a>. </p>\n<p>It’s a form of protest that has some observers shaking their heads. Just how meaningful, critics have asked, will it be to wear black?</p>\n<p>“YOUR SILENCE is THE problem,” tweeted Rose McGowan, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/19/16484728/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein\">one of Harvey Weinstein’s most vocal accusers</a>, shortly after the protest was first announced in December. (She has since deleted the tweets.) “You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly and affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.” </p>\n<p>(Weinstein’s soon-to-be ex-wife, Georgina Chapman, <a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2017/10/12/16464736/marchesa-harvey-weinstein-georgina-chapman-vogue\">is one of the chief designers for Marchesa</a>, and during Weinstein’s heyday it was common for actresses courting his good will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/5/16431848/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-rumors\">to wear Marchesa</a> on the award circuit.) </p>\n<p>“Don’t most men who attend the Globes come cloaked in either all-black or mostly black, with a black suit and black shoes and a black tie, anyway?” asked <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/187076/the-golden-globes-need-something-more-than-all-black-attire-to-show-solidarity-with-metoo#.mPWivgLSC\">Mic</a>, after Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson confirmed that men, too, would be taking part in the protest.</p>\n<p>“Black was <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/american-music-awards-2017-red-carpet-fashion-trend-black-dresses/\">already a red carpet trend heading into the Globes</a>,” noted <a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2018/1/5/16846866/golden-globes-black-dress-protest\">Racked</a>; “hell, ABC even called it <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/golden-globes-2017-black-back-red-carpet/story?id=44637529\">the standout color at <em>last</em> year’s Globes</a>.”</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How do you cover red-carpet fashion during #MeToo?

Regardless of whether it works, the idea draws on a long history of women using fashion as a form of protest, one that speaks to fashion’s often overlooked ability to make political and aesthetic statements. </p>\n<h3>Fashion is an incredibly powerful tool for protest movements</h3>\n<div> <figure>\n<img alt=\"Suffragette&amp;nbsp;Charlotte (Charlie) Marsh&amp;nbsp;at Hyde Park rally, 1908.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JafbrNF6uvQdHeyDO3bK3hv338o=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9985875/Suffragette_Charlotte__Charlie__Marsh_at_Hyde_Park_rally__1908.png\">\n<cite>Wikimedia Commons/<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Victuallers\">Victuallers</a></cite>\n<figcaption>Suffragette Charlotte (Charlie) Marsh at Hyde Park rally, 1908.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Perhaps the most enduring use of fashion as a tool for political protest is the case of “suffragette white.” </p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://History.com\">History.com</a> summarized the movement, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, a member of the militant British suffragette group the Women’s Social and Political Union, asked protesters in 1908 to wear one of three symbolic colors at a suffrage rally: white for purity, purple for dignity, and green for hope. (It’s worth noting that using white as a color of purity carries some unfortunate racial undertones, which were reinforced by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11914757/Racism-and-the-suffragettes-the-uncomfortable-truth.html\">the rampant racism</a> that was common<strong> </strong>among early suffragettes.) </p>\n<p>The resulting sea of 30,000 women in white, purple, and green created enormous visual cohesion, and suffragettes began to make a practice of wearing long white skirts to their rallies. </p>\n<p>After the suffragette movement ended, it became common for women politicians and their supporters <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/11/07/hillary-clinton-vote-white/\">to wear white</a> as a callback to the movement. Shirley Chisholm wore white in 1969 when she became the first African American woman elected to Congress, and again on her presidential campaign posters in 1972. </p>\n<p>Protesters for the Equal Rights Amendment in 1978 wore white. When Geraldine Ferraro became the first female vice presidential candidate on a major-party ticket, she delivered her acceptance speech in a white pantsuit.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"2016 Democratic National Convention - Day 4\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4tJLDfsLBUx3tTPTBrqWpDChiU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9985881/584454426.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Paul Morigi/WireImage</cite>\n<figcaption>Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>During the 2016 presidential election, suffragette white became a favorite symbol of Hillary Clinton and her supporters. Clinton wore white to accept the Democratic presidential nomination, and again during her third debate with Donald Trump. On election day, some of her supporters posted selfies of themselves <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/11/07/hillary-clinton-vote-white/\">dressed all in white</a>, proudly showing off their “I voted” stickers. </p>\n<p>After the election of Donald Trump, a new feminist form of fashionable protest was born. The pussyhat, frequently handmade and featuring pink, catlike ears, became <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/18/14310520/womens-march-washington-dc-protest\">an icon of the Women’s March</a>, under the same basic principle that ultimately helped to define the suffragette movement: It created visual unity. </p>\n<p>“If everyone at the march wears a pink hat, the crowd will be a sea of pink, showing that we stand together, united,” wrote Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman in their <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwBjtQGbV7gEZU1TdUd2b1JIZGM/view\">widely distributed PussyProjectPDF</a>, which provided free instructions for knitting a pussyhat of one’s own — and indeed, overhead pictures of the march show the Washington Mall covered in a vast swath of pink.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pussyhat-clad protesters at the Women’s March in January 2016. \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijAoYiiZMOiV8U8Had8ZehOp8gQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9985887/820025490.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Evelyn Hockstein/The Washington Post via Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Pussyhat-clad protesters at the Women’s March in January 2016. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Suh and Zweiman also chose to make their symbol something pink and feminine and fashion-oriented as part of a larger, deliberate statement: In designing the pussyhat to be a handknit item, they were taking the oft-sneered-at “woman’s art” of crafting and fashion and making it political. </p>\n<p>“Knitting circles are sometimes scoffed at as frivolous ‘gossiping circles,’” <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwBjtQGbV7gEZU1TdUd2b1JIZGM/view\">they wrote</a>, “when really, these circles are powerful gatherings of women, a safe space to talk, a place where women support women.” </p>\n<p>Women’s movements tend to accumulate enduring, fashion-related protest symbols, perhaps because women are encouraged to care more about fashion than men are. But both sides of the political aisle use fashion as protest: Trump supporters, for instance, have the inescapable “Make America Great Again” red hat. </p>\n<p>“If I were ever going to design a Trump presidential library, and somebody said what’s the artifact you most want, I would say the original hat of Donald Trump’s under glass,” <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/17/politics/donald-trump-make-america-great-again-iconic-hat/index.html\">presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN</a>. “The whole campaign can be summed up in his collected Twitters, and that ball cap.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Donald Trump waves a “Make America Great Again” hat before a group of supporters. \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNdFz8msKMRGPueVvXOBXNc0Zn4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9985891/855635890.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n<figcaption>Donald Trump waves his signature red “Make America Great Again” hat before a group of supporters. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Fashion is, in other words, an enormously powerful political tool, rich with symbolic potential and the ability to create visual solidarity. </p>\n<p>A simple hat can tell the world that you are an anti-Trump feminist or a pro-Trump nativist populist; strategic use of a single color can link a politician to a century’s worth of protest movements in one blow. So while we don’t yet know how effective the Golden Globes black dress protest will be, we do know that it has the potential to become iconic. </p>",

In our current climate, to be accused is to be convicted. Due process is nowhere to be found.”</p>\n<p>That’s an interesting statement, given almost none of the powerful men accused of sexual violence over the course of the past year have been charged with a crime, let alone convicted.</p>\n<p>Bill Cosby, who faced credible accusations of sexual harassment and rape from <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/13/showbiz/gallery/cosby-accusers/index.html\">more than 50 women</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/6/17/15824444/i-believe-bill-cosby-jury-mistrial\">was not convicted after a trial for sexual assault</a>. The late Roger Ailes, who faced credible accusations of sexual assault and harassment <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-ailes-accusers-list_us_57a9fa19e4b06e52746db865\">from more than 20 women</a>, was never charged with anything, although <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/18/media/timeline-roger-ailes-last-year/index.html\">the FBI is reportedly probing Fox News</a> to determine whether the network should have informed shareholders about the settlements made in Ailes’s harassment lawsuits. </p>\n<p>The NYPD has announced <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/3/16604760/nypd-harvey-weinstein-rape-arrest\">vague plans</a> to arrest Harvey Weinstein at some point, but has not done so. Neither <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/3/16602628/kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-allegations-house-of-cards\">Kevin Spacey</a> nor <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/11/29/16714460/matt-lauer-fired-today-show-sexual-harassment-behavior\">Matt Lauer</a>, who Merkin describes as the truly “heinous sorts,” have faced any legal charges for sexual harassment, assault, or rape. </p>\n<p>And as for Garrison Keillor, Jonathan Schwartz, Ryan Lizza, and Al Franken, four accused men who Merkin holds up as a different kind of alleged predator: None of them have been charged with anything either. They may have been accused, but criminal charges, to say nothing of criminal convictions, are nowhere in sight. </p>\n<p>So in that case, what due process is missing?</p>\n<h3>Have any of the accused men lost their jobs without investigation?</h3>\n<p>Of course, Merkin may not necessarily be talking about due process in its legal sense. It’s entirely reasonable to read her statement idiomatically, so that “to be accused is to be convicted” means “to be accused is to experience negative consequences.” Likewise, “due process is nowhere to be found” could be interpreted as “these negative consequences are occurring on the basis of an accusation, without an investigation.”</p>\n<p>It is true that many of the accused men have lost their jobs, which is certainly a negative consequence. But is it accurate to say that they lost their jobs without investigation?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/29/16715604/garrison-keillor-fired-allegations\">Keillor was fired from Minnesota Public Radio</a> following what was reportedly <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/garrison-keillor-fired-for-improper-behavior/460802703/#1\">a month-long investigation</a> into “inappropriate behavior.” Schwartz was first suspended and then put on leave following <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-public-radio-fires-hosts-lopate-schwartz/\">what New York Public Radio describes as</a> “two separate investigations overseen by outside counsel,” which found that Schwartz had “violated our standards for providing an inclusive, appropriate, and respectful work environment.” </p>\n<p>Lizza was fired from the New Yorker following a review of what the magazine <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/business/ryan-lizza-sexual-misconduct.html\">described as</a> “improper sexual conduct,” and has been suspended from CNN pending CNN’s own investigation. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/7/16742170/al-franken-resigns-accusations\">Franken resigned from the Senate</a> under pressure from a group of Democratic senators after being accused of sexual misconduct by eight different women.</p>\n<p>Out of all these cases, the only accused man who did not lose his job following an internal investigation was Franken. Had Franken been subject to an investigation from the Senate Ethics Committee, rather than choosing to resign voluntarily, the investigation would most likely <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/senate-ethics-committee-sexual-harassment-black-hole-34a0f600dac4/\">have taken several years</a> and been repeatedly blocked by partisan posturing. </p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that, in cases where such investigations <em>have</em> been conducted, the Senate Ethics Committee has not ruled against a sitting senator in more than two decades. But if it were to break tradition to rule in favor of Franken’s accusers and recommend Franken’s expulsion, his accusers would receive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-steps-up-scrutiny-of-congressional-sexual-harassment-complaints/2017/12/07/5420380c-db73-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.4509f391178d\">a settlement from Treasury funds</a> — meaning that they would have essentially been paying themselves a portion of their settlement out of their tax dollars. </p>\n<h3>Do companies have to wait for a criminal conviction before they fire employees?</h3>\n<p>While it’s unlikely that any of these internal investigations would hold up to the standards of a criminal court, it’s also the case that you don’t need to be convicted in a criminal court to be fired. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-due-process-assault-freak-out-is-a-fever-dream/2017/12/01/8f14cd80-d6d5-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.6e75246b9eb0\">As Christine Emba wrote for the Washington Post</a> in December, “the Constitution doesn’t oblige NBC to retain Matt Lauer until a court somewhere finds him guilty of a sex crime.”</p>\n<p>There’s a good reason for the standard of proof to be lower in internal corporate investigations than it is in criminal courts. The US court system has a very high bar for criminal convictions because a criminal conviction should not be inflicted on anyone unless they are found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>\n<p>But as the potential consequences of a court decision grow less serious, the standard of proof lowers: In civil court, the standard of proof is <a href=\"http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-law-basics/the-differences-between-a-criminal-case-and-a-civil-case.html\">a preponderance of evidence</a>, because there’s no possibility of a criminal conviction at stake. In college campus Title IX hearings, where the most consequential thing that can happen is an expulsion, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-Does-the-End-of-Obama-s/241281\">colleges can choose</a> between a standard of a preponderance of evidence or “clear and convincing evidence.”</p>\n<p>For cases involving sexual violence, these kinds of lower-stakes alternatives are invaluable because sexual violence is very difficult to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt. </p>\n<p>There are usually few witnesses, physical evidence can be waved away as “she wanted it rough,” and most people <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/19/12555646/amber-heard-johnny-depp-domestic-abuse-divorce\">are primed to believe the accused rather than the victim</a> — especially when, as in<strong> </strong>these<strong> </strong>recent<strong> </strong>cases, the accused is a powerful and well-liked man. </p>\n<p>A victim might not have the kind of evidence that would stand up to a criminal court — but she might have enough to register as “a preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing evidence.” So the victim can go for a lower-stakes punishment: No one will face jail time, but maybe she won’t have to be on the same campus as her abuser or work in the same office.</p>\n<h3>Is getting fired for cause the same as being convicted without due process?</h3>\n<p>So what has happened to the four<strong> </strong>men who Merkin specifically holds up as unjustly convicted without due process, these innocent souls sacrificed to the Reckoning?</p>\n<p>They’ve lost their jobs. Three of them were fired following formal investigations into their behavior; Franken, whose former office does not have a reasonably functioning investigatory<s> </s>arm, voluntarily left following eight separate accusations. While the Keillor, Schwartz, and Lizza investigations may not have been up to the standards of a criminal court, they also didn’t carry the same type of consequences as a criminal court, and as such they required a lower burden of proof.</p>\n<p>None of these men have been convicted of any crimes. None of them have even been charged with any crimes.</p>\n<p>But what about the other men affected, the ones Merkin labels as “the heinous sorts”? The ones who face multiple, detailed accusations of rape and sexual assault, with witnesses and corroborating evidence to spare?</p>\n<p>A few of them have charges pending against them. Fewer of them have been arrested. None of them have been convicted.</p>\n<p>And in the past, when these kinds of powerful men were accused of sexual violence and made it all the way to trial, almost none of them received jail sentences.</p>\n<p>Given these facts, is it really the accused men of the Reckoning who have not had due process? Or is it their victims?</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Correction: </strong>An earlier version of this piece stated that the standard of evidence on college campus Title IX cases is “clear and convincing evidence.” In fact, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-Does-the-End-of-Obama-s/241281\">colleges can choose</a> between using a standard of a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing evidence.</p>",

(He also tweeted about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949608746497576960\">unemployment rate</a> and an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949610896241946626\">ABC News reporter</a> suspended by the network over a reporting error.) </p>\n<p>Bandy Lee, the Yale psychiatrist who last month traveled to Capitol Hill to meet with a group of Democratic lawmakers — and one Republican — to brief them on Trump’s mental health, told <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/5/16770060/trump-mental-health-psychiatrist-25th-amendment\">Vox’s Eliza Barclay</a> recently that she believes special counsel Robert Mueller’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/30/16570518/robert-mueller-paul-manafort-george-papadopoulos-strategy\">indictments</a> brought about a “mental health crisis” for Trump, who is not able to cope well with ordinary stresses. She is among a number of professionals in the field calling for an emergency evaluation of Trump’s mental state. </p>\n<p>Questions about the president’s mental fitness also appear in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFire-Fury-Inside-Trump-White%2Fdp%2F1250158060\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</em></a><em>,</em><em> </em>the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">salacious new book</a> on the early months of the Trump White House by longtime media writer Michael Wolff. </p>\n<p><em>Fire and Fury </em>is full of dishy gossip, although its veracity is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">often unclear</a>. Wolff’s book depicts a deeply unprepared, incurious president surrounded by toadying advisers nonetheless concerned about his ability to do the job. From Wolff’s account on reporting for the book in <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-wolff-my-insane-year-inside-trumps-white-house-1071504\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions. It used to be inside of 30 minutes he’d repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories — now it was within 10 minutes. Indeed, many of his tweets were the product of his repetitions — he just couldn’t stop saying something.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One excerpt from <em>Fire and Fury,</em> which I have a digital copy of, describes how some of Trump’s closest aides — including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who reportedly called the president a “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/rex-tillerson-at-the-breaking-point\">fucking moron”</a> — spoke of him behind closed doors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This—insulting Donald Trump’s intelligence—was both the thing you could not do and the thing—drawing there-but-for-the-grace-of-God guffaws across the senior staff—that everybody was guilty of. Everyone, in his or her own way, struggled to express the baldly obvious fact that the president did not know enough, did not know what he didn’t know, did not particularly care, and, to boot, was confident if not serene in his unquestioned certitudes. There was now a fair amount of back-of-the-classroom giggling about who had called Trump what. For Steve Mnuchin and Reince Priebus, he was an “idiot.” For Gary Cohn, he was “dumb as shit.” For H. R. McMaster he was a “dope.” The list went on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The book has set off a feud between Trump and his former top strategist, Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon, who looks like a major source for <em>Fire and Fury</em>. (Wolff maintains that many of Trump’s aides spoke with him; he spent weeks going in and out of the White House to report the book. Wolff also <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/michael-wolff-says-he-absolutely-spoke-president-donald-trump-fire-t120837\">says</a> he spoke directly with Trump.) </p>\n<p>In a briefing with reporters later on Saturday at Camp David, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/06/trump-boasts-that-hes-like-really-smart-and-a-very-stable-genius-amid-questions-over-his-mental-fitness/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_pp-trumptweets-832am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.3d0050e846a3\">said</a> Wolff’s book was a “disgrace” and that the writer, who interviewed him in 2016 for a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/donald-trump-conversation-politics-dark-898465\">Hollywood Reporter</a> profile, “does not know me at all.” He declared the book a “work of fiction” and renewed his call for federal libel laws to be strengthened. “Libel laws are very weak in this country. If they were stronger, hopefully, you would not have something like that happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trump on Wednesday said Bannon had “lost his mind” in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/3/16845920/trump-michael-wolff-book-steve-bannon\">scathing statement</a> reacting to Bannon’s comments to Wolff.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book.

President Trump is not only notorious for his “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/can-you-read/2018/01/04/46d967a2-f18c-11e7-b3bf-ab90a706e175_story.html?undefined=&utm_term=.dbc859ba7e6c&wpisrc=nl_most&wpmm=1\">post-literate</a>” obsession with cable TV, but Ward’s characterization of the president as insisting on watching only gorilla fight scenes has a real-life antecedent: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo\">a 1997 New Yorker report</a> in which Trump made one of his sons fast-forward through an action movie solely so he could watch only the fight scenes.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s the fast-and-loose caliber of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/5/16855504/mitch-mcconnell-haircut-trump-fire-and-fury\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/5/16854030/donald-trump-fire-and-fury-medicare-for-all\">of the anecdotes</a> in <em>Fire and Fury</em>, which Wolff apparently sourced through a blend of both on- and off-the-record, semi-formal White House access.

Orrin Hatch (R-UT) said he would retire, all eyes turned to Mitt Romney. </p>\n<p>Once on the Republican presidential ticket, Romney is a familiar and respected face among Utah’s conservative establishment voter base — one that has never had a taste for the president’s antics.</p>\n<p>Utah is unique in Republican politics. Nationally, there’s been a push to reimagine the Republican Party through President Trump’s (and to some degree, Steve Bannon’s) vision. But Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox told Vox recently<strong> </strong>that a transformation away from the traditionally pro-immigration, free trade, small-government, and moralistic conservative mentality faces a tougher road in the majority Mormon state.</p>\n<p>“Bannon would get his head handed to him if he came to the state of Utah,” Cox said.</p>\n<p>Romney has made no effort to hide his distaste for Trump, and the president reportedly tried to convince the 83-year-old Hatch — who has kept closer to Trump — to run for re-election to prevent a Romney run. It’s made the Utah 2018 Senate race appear on the surface as a matchup between the leader of the Republican Party and Romney.</p>\n<p>I asked Cox to ask what made of Utah’s deep conservative roots in the age of Trump. He said the national narrative around Trump and Romney has forgotten that Utah is not like other Republican states. Utah voters still prize candidates’ adherence to conservative morals, they hate Trump’s tweets, and to them, Romney is “royalty,” he said.</p>\n<p>Here’s our conversation, lightly edited for style and length.</p>\n<h3>Is this going to be Mitt Romney versus Trump?</h3>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>How do you see the Trump era of Republican politics playing out in Utah?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>While Utah is a very red state, I think there is a mistake to compare it to other red states. It’s more constructive to look back. There are two places to look. </p>\n<p>One is the 2016 primary. ... Rather late in the race, there were only three candidates left and Trump finished third — a distant third — even behind John Kasich. </p>\n<p>And then also to look at how Mitt Romney performed in the state as a candidate versus Trump. The data still shows that Trump is under water in the state of Utah.</p>\n<p>I think people are happy with the tangible results that are happening in the first year of the Trump administration — less happy with his Twitter feed, perhaps, and other things.</p>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>What does the national narrative of Utah get wrong?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>People are trying to posit Mitt Romney running for Hatch’s seat as Romney versus Trump. and I don’t think most Utahns will see it that way. Mitt Romney is royalty here in the state of Utah. And I can tell you the polling numbers we’ve seen over the past two years, he’s still the most popular politician in the state of Utah.</p>\n<p>If you look at the mean score for Mitt Romney, he has the best mean score for anyone in the state. It’s just pretty much an inevitability.</p>\n<p>[The idea that] Bannon could come in, or Democrats, in a year that Republicans are doing terrible — that this is a pickup state — it’s just not even close.</p>\n<p>I have had to reevaluate my political compass nationally. Things keep happening that I didn’t think could happen. But that’s certainly not been the case in Utah.</p>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>What do you make of this Bannon purge of the Republican Party? There was some chatter after Hatch’s announcement, that Utah could be a test for Bannon.</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>Bannon actually had Orrin Hatch on his list, and by all reports backed off later at the encouragement of Trump. When it looked like Romney would come in, he suddenly warmed up to Hatch. </p>\n<p>But Utah was absolutely on the Bannon list, and I can tell you very clearly that Bannon would get his head handed to him if he came to the state of Utah. And, in fact, our own governor has publicly stated a few weeks ago when Bannon attacked Mitt Romney, that he would publicly work to defeat anyone that had the support of Steve Bannon running for office, and I feel the same way.</p>\n<p>Having Bannon’s support would be the kiss of death.</p>\n<p>I don’t see any big-name challenges to Romney, and people make big mistakes in comparing, if we can flip Alabama, then there’s flipping Utah. </p>\n<div><aside><q>Literally the only way you could flip Utah is if Roy Moore came and ran.</q></aside></div>\n<p> If there is any kind of race at all, it would be somewhere in a primary where someone that Trump or Steve Bannon really supports tried to run against Mitt Romney.</p>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>Somebody who actually hasn’t come out against Trump, who is retiring, is Hatch. He actually has become more vocal in defense of Trump. How has that played out in the state?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>It’s been a mixed bag. I think because he was able to convince the president to do certain things — like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/4/16733798/utah-national-monument-trump-bears-ears-staircase-escalante\">monument rollback</a>, which Republicans in the state of Utah have been agitating for, for 20 years. So I think that people here recognize that’s how he was able to accomplish some things. </p>\n<p>But it hurt Hatch’s popularity. There’s no question. Of course, he promised not to run again last time he ran, and sees that Mitt Romney is the most popular in the state. Hatch’s popularity was at the lowest, maybe, of his career. Certainly, some of the hyperbole wasn’t as helpful and didn’t hurt Mitt Romney on the other side.</p>\n<h3>What do Utah voters want?</h3>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>You say Romney is royalty, but what will Utahns be looking for in a senator after 40 years of Hatch?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>Well if Romney runs, they’ll be looking for Romney.</p>\n<p>I don’t think you can complicate this too much. He’s incredibly respected. They love who he is as a person, they love who he is as a family man. they love his track record, from the Olympics to being a successful governor. Someone who has really carried the banner — even though he didn’t live in Utah — for Utah Mormons, someone they can look to who respects people.</p>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>What would you say are the biggest policy areas concerning Utahns?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>I don’t know that there will be huge policy issues that will come up. I don’t know if I see a Sen. Romney vote that different than Sen. Hatch or the rest of Utah’s delegation. It’s a very conservative state, and I think Mitt Romney, at least through his last presidential run, the policy that he advocated for will be very similar. </p>\n<p>The interesting one — and it depends on what Congress will decide to tackle this year — the immigration issue is one that could raise its head with DACA and the wall and border issues.</p>\n<p>Utah is a place doesn’t act like other red states when it comes to immigration. We had immigration reform a couple years ago that didn’t happen because the federal government didn’t allow us to — but very forward-thinking immigration. I don’t think you will see differences when it comes to Obamacare, and I don’t know if entitlement reform will get a look.</p>\n<h3>Is the anti-Trump Romney the Romney Utahns want to see?</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"President-Elect Trump Holds Meetings At Trump Tower In New York\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwkhqX_4N2gOiUw7v4cz5Kp3Y_A=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9984819/626524674.jpg.jpg\">\n<cite>Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n</figure>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>Something you said earlier — that Utahns are happy with results and less happy with his Twitter feed. There are a lot of senators and lawmakers who have criticized the president, his agenda, and rhetoric that continue to support his agenda and really push to get him legislative wins. What’s an effective check and balance? What should they do?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>Well, every politician, especially a Republican, has to find their own path forward. I would disagree that they are just giving him legislative wins. The conservative agenda existed long before Donald Trump. The more interesting legislative arguments are where Trump disagrees with traditional conservatism.</p>\n<p>First of all, this is a problem that has been going on from the imperial presidency — in the ’60s and on — that Congress recognizes, especially individual members of Congress. </p>\n<p>They have kind of lost their way and their constitutional position in understanding how those checks and balances are supposed to function in the first place. I thought it was important, when President Obama was the president, that we are not ruling the country through fiat, that Congress does have a role to play, and they should play that role more actively.</p>\n<p>Not against President Trump, per se, but against the presidency in general, reestablishing the Congress as a thorough legislative body it was meant to be — and not letting executive orders go unchallenged.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to individual pieces of legislation, though, where they are just voting up or down, I hope that they’ll represent their constituents and, as far as Republicans go, that they’ll continue to advocate for conservative legislation that I believe in.</p>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>Or even on the investigative front — Mitt Romney is somebody who has spoken out about the president’s tax returns, or come out in front of the president’s policies. Is that something Utahns would expect him to bring to Congress?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>That’s a really interesting question. Jeff Flake, for example, who also happens to be Mormon, and others, who when they decided they are retiring become much more vocal, either because they couldn’t win in the first place, or just decided not to run. I don’t think Mitt would have that kind of discretion that he would have to toe some kind of line.</p>\n<p>For one, he is 70 years old. I don’t know if he would want to run for multiple terms, but I don’t think him doing that would hit his popularity too much in the state of Utah, like Republicans in other red states.</p>\n<h3>Utah isn’t your typical Republican state</h3>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>I was going back through some old Trump tweets about Utah; what’s your reaction when you see those?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>I think most people just blow that kind of stuff off as President Trump just being President Trump, but clearly the tapes that came out prior to the election played more of a role in the state of Utah than maybe in other places.</p>\n<div><aside><q>People here are still interested in the morality aspect of the leaders they choose. </q></aside></div>\n<p>All the lines have been crossed that I don’t know if it matters anymore. I honestly don’t. I think we have all had to reset our bearings on what is and what isn’t acceptable. </p>\n<h4>Tara Golshan</h4>\n<p>Among Utah’s representation in Congress you see both the anti-establishment thread that fueled Mike Lee, as well as this strong Mormon morality that has come through in a lot of Hatch’s legacy. How is the anti-establishment thread in Utah different than what we saw in the 2016 race?</p>\n<h4>Spencer Cox</h4>\n<p>That’s a valid question, and I’m not sure exactly how to answer. I mean, if you consider Mike Lee anti-establishment, he ran unchallenged last time around and had the support of the governor. So I guess there is a dual thread, but Mike Lee is very well respected and loved by the establishment and anti-establishment alike.</p>\n<p>I would say that the anti-establishment is likely smaller here in the Republican Party than elsewhere. There’s a fairly vocal anti-establishment that is more involved in party politics but is a fairly small minority of the party as a whole in the state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

Now, in journalist Michael Wolff’s new book, <em>Fire and Fury</em>, it is possible to relive some of Spicer’s public humiliation.</p>\n<p>Spicer doesn’t play a starring role in the book, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">which dishes gossip and details</a> from Trump’s first year in the White House. That’s probably because, at least in Wolff’s account, he was largely marginalized in a presidential administration with an outsized obsession with the media. </p>\n<p>But Spicer’s occasional cameos are a reminder of the dysfunction that permeated the White House, particularly in the early months of the administration — or, really, on Day 1, when Spicer stood at the podium and defended fake inauguration crowds to reporters.</p>\n<p>Wolff characterizes Spicer as Trump’s “flunky and whipping boy,” and treats him with a mixture of pity and disdain. In Wolff’s view, he was a “mild-mannered, process-oriented professional” turned into a “joke figure standing at the White House door.” The author describes Spicer’s daily mantra as “you can’t make this shit up.” </p>\n<p>Wolff’s book has its own “you can’t make this shit up” quality —<strong> </strong>calling into question just how accurate his account is. As Vox’s Andrew Prokop explained, the book <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16845640/michael-wolff-trump-book\">has been scrutinized</a> for the sourcing and authenticity of some of its most sensational scenes. Nevertheless, its broad outlines — an uncontrollable, mercurial president and a factionalized White House — were echoed in many news reports throughout Trump’s first year in office. </p>\n<p>Spicer <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wh-press-secretary-sean-spicer-unaware-trump-discussed/story?id=52157792\">told George Stephanopolous on Good Morning America</a> that he had met with Wolff. He said some of the anecdotes are true and the quotes are correct, “but the context in which they’re given, aren’t.” </p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are the most notable Sean Spicer moments in <em>Fire and Fury.</em></p>\n<p><strong>1) </strong><strong>The problem wasn’t the fake inauguration crowd story, it was that Sean Spicer didn’t really </strong><em><strong>sell</strong></em><strong> the fake inauguration crowd story.</strong></p>\n<p>Trump had convinced himself, and bragged to others, about the huge size of his inauguration crowd. Spicer was then tasked with repeating that astounding falsehood to reporters — something for which he and the administration were quickly pilloried. Wolff writes of Spicer’s mortifying debut:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He sent his new press secretary, Sean Spicer—whose personal mantra would shortly become “You can’t make this shit up”—to argue his case in a media moment that turned Spicer, quite a buttoned-down political professional, into a national joke, which he seemed destined to never recover from. To boot, the president blamed Spicer for not making the million phantom souls seem real. [p. 47]</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was Spicer’s rude awakening, according to Wolff: “It was the first presidential instance of what the campaign regulars had learned over many months: on the most basic level, Trump just did not, as Spicer later put it, give a fuck.”</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> Spicer fought the leaks — and the leaks won.</strong></p>\n<p>Trump railed against leaks, though many came from the battling factions inside the White House, specifically aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner and strategist Steve Bannon. But Spicer gave it a sporting try:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The constant leaking was often blamed on lower minions and permanent executive branch staff, culminating in late February with an all-hands meeting of staffers called by Sean Spicer—cell phones surrendered at the door—during which the press secretary issued threats of random phone checks and admonitions about the use of encrypted texting apps. Everybody was a potential leaker; everybody was accusing everybody else of being a leaker. </p>\n<p>Everybody <em>was </em>a leaker. [p. 121]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> Trump allegedly wasn’t a fan of Spicer’s brains. Or his looks.</strong></p>\n<p>Trump allegedly railed that his press secretary was “stupid (and looks terrible too).” (p.122) Trump’s vitriol wasn’t reserved for Spicer. Wolff writes that Trump had a habit of bad-mouthing his staff, often on after-dinner phone calls to outside friends and confidantes. </p>\n<p><strong>4</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> Spicer wasn’t Trump’s first choice for the job. Or second. Or third, or ...</strong> <strong>hey, even Tucker Carlson</strong><strong> might have</strong><strong> got</strong><strong>ten</strong><strong> a call</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Kellyanne Conway claims to have turned down the job of White House press secretary, and Trump, according to Wolff, wanted to find a “star” for the job. That apparently includes media personalities that appear on Fox News: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, who had spoken at the convention, was on the list, as was Ann Coulter. Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo was also under consideration. (This was television, the president-elect said, and it ought to be a good-looking woman.) When none of those ideas panned out, the job was offered to Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who turned it down. [p.205]</p></blockquote>\n<p>The administration, of course, ended up choosing Spicer — an RNC staffer close to former chief of staff Reince Priebus. That the White House didn’t go with a big name, Wolff writes, stemmed from a Bannonesque view of the media as the enemy, denying the supposed elite a high-profile liaison. </p>\n<p>Still, Spicer had his own reservations about taking the job, reportedly asking, “‘If I do this, will I ever be able to work again?’”</p>\n<p><strong>5)</strong> <strong>Trump was constantly berating Spicer about his briefing performances.</strong><strong>..</strong></p>\n<p>This one <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/arts/television/sean-spicer-donald-trump-melissa-mccarthy.html\">isn’t exactly new</a>, but Wolff describes Trump unleashing “a constant stream of directorial castigation and instruction that reliably rattled the press secretary.” Trump’s obsession with the media meant Spicer never really had a chance: </p>\n<blockquote><p>It was Donald Trump who was not able to relinquish this proximity to the press and the stage in his own house. He regularly berated Spicer for his ham-handed performances, often giving his full attention to them. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>6</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>W</strong><strong>hich meant Trump never abandoned the dream of a Fox News host on the podium</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Wolff says that Trump wanted to replace Spicer from the get-go, and that at one point, he made overtures to Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of the Fox News show <em>The Five</em>. (Some White House sources deny she was offered a job.) Wolff says she declined the post, but suggested Anthony Scaramucci (whom she was rumored to be dating) — who eventually would be hired as White House communications director.</p>\n<p><strong>7) At least Spicer dodged the Russia bullet</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Special counsel Robert Mueller <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmichael-s.-schmidt&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection\">is reportedly investigating</a> a statement Trump helped draft aboard Air Force One in July after revelations that his son, Don Jr., had met with a Russian lawyer. What Trump did not do was enlist his communications team, including Sean Spicer, for help in crafting a response. Instead, Wolff says they were “relegated to the back of the plane and excluded from the panicky discussions.” </p>\n<p>That might not have been a bad thing: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“It used to hurt my feelings when I saw them running around doing things that were my job,” said Spicer. “Now I’m glad to be out of the loop.” [p.258]</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>8) Spicer also reportedly got on the wrong side of </strong> <strong>“Jarvanka</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>”</strong></p>\n<p>Even more than Trump’s displeasure with Spicer, Ivanka and Jared might have sealed Spicer’s fate. They questioned his loyalty, in part because Spicer and his team weren’t seen as doing enough to defend the interests of the first daughter and her husband, according to Wolff. </p>\n<p>Spicer faced an impossible situation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Spicer, ever ridiculed in the media for his cockamamie defense of the White House and a seeming dumb loyalty, had been judged by the president, quite from the inauguration, to be not loyal enough and not nearly as aggressive as he should be in Trump’s defense. Or, in Jared and Ivanka’s view, in his family’s defense. “What does Spicer’s forty-member comm staff actually do?” was a persistent First Family question. [p.272]</p></blockquote>\n<p>This displeasure with Spicer, in Wolff’s account, gave Scaramucci an opening into the administration. Ivanka and Jared suggested him for the White House communications director job, which had been vacant since May:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“He’s good on television,” Ivanka told Spicer when she explained the rationale for hiring a former hedge fund manager as White House communications director. “Maybe he can help us.” [p.273]</p></blockquote>\n<p>Spicer <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/21/16011484/sean-spicer-resigns-anthony-scaramucci\">reportedly objected to the hiring of Scaramucci</a> — a hedge fund manager who had no press experience — and resigned after Trump named him White House communications director. “Oddly,” Wolff writes of Spicer’s resignation, “this seemed to catch everyone unawares.”</p>",
