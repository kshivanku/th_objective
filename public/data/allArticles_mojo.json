        "content": "<p>Ohio removes people from the voting rolls if they have failed to vote in the past two years <em>and</em> then fail to respond to a notice <em>and</em> fail to vote during the next four years after that. But federal law says that you can’t remove someone from the rolls for failure to vote. So is Ohio breaking the law, since failure to vote is what precipitates this process? Or are they OK because there’s more here than <em>just</em> failure to vote?</p>\n<p>That depends on what the law actually says. I was curious, so I took a look at the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-42-public-health-and-welfare-chapter-20-elective-franchise-subchapter-i-h-national-voter\">text of the 1993 motor voter law.</a> Here’s the relevant section:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Any State program or activity to protect the integrity of the electoral process by ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and current voter registration roll for elections for Federal office…shall not result in the removal of the name of any person from the official list of voters registered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person’s failure to vote, <strong>except that nothing in this paragraph may be construed to prohibit a State from using the procedures described in subsections (c) and (d) of this section to remove an individual from the official list of eligible voters if the individual</strong> – (A) has not either notified the applicable registrar (in person or in writing) or responded during the period described in subparagraph (B) to the notice sent by the applicable registrar; and then (B) has not voted or appeared to vote in 2 or more consecutive general elections for Federal office.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Section (c) is about purging voter rolls based on change-of-address information from the Post Office. Here is section (d):</p>\n<blockquote><p>A State shall not remove the name of a registrant from the official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office on the ground that the registrant has changed residence unless the registrant…<strong>has failed to respond to a notice</strong>…and has not voted or appeared to vote…in an election <strong>during the period beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for Federal office that occurs after the date of the notice.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Ohio program follows this to the letter: they send a notice, and then purge you from the voting rolls if you fail to vote over the next four years—which is two federal elections. The only remaining question, then, is the same one we started with: Does the <em>precipitating</em> event have to be evidence of a change of residence, or can it be failure to vote?</p>\n<p>Section (c) of the law is all about using change-of-address information as a reason to start the removal process, and the fact that there’s a separate Section (d) implies that there can be other reasons too. The question, then, is whether failure to vote for two years can be one of them. As near as I can tell, the motor voter law is silent about that.</p>\n<p>I have to confess that Ohio’s procedure doesn’t sound entirely <em>un</em>reasonable to me. No one questions that there’s a legitimate state interest in keeping voter rolls up-to-date, and there are a limited number of ways to do that. I’m not sure what the technical legal standard is here, but my personal view is that this seems like an arguably sensible approach that’s probably within the purview of a state to enact. I suspect the Supreme Court will see it the same way.</p>",

Republicans and Democrats in Congress are currently seeking to reach a deal before DACA expirations begin to spike in March and have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/10/daca-reinstatement-deal-republicans-democrats-2018-333702\">said</a> that the ruling shouldn’t affect ongoing immigration negotiations. Immigrant advocacy groups are pushing for DACA to be included in the spending bill that is needed to keep the government open beyond January 19.</p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders meanwhile called the decision “outrageous, especially in light of the President’s successful bipartisan meeting with House and Senate members at the White House on the same day.” </p>\n<p>All this uncertainty means immigration advocacy groups are not giving up the fight. Many lauded the decision but continued to press for a permanent solution from Congress. “This victory should make it even more clear that Congress must act now. Dreamers—and our nation—deserve more than temporary relief from the courts; they deserve a bipartisan Dream Act,” Karen Tumlin, legal director at the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Congress must deliver the bipartisan Dream Act by January 19—the clock is ticking and every day that they delay is another day that young people lose their protections,” Adrian Reyna, a Dream Act campaign manager at United We Dream, an immigrant youth-led network, said in a press call today. “The court decision and the meeting yesterday are signs of movement and momentum by officials in the government—momentum that has been built by the immigrant youth who are fighting for our lives.” </p>\n<p><span>Gabriela Garcia, a 29-year-old DACA recipient who is currently a law student at the University of San Francisco, similarly calls the decision “a little ray of hope” in the midst of a tumultuous period for immigrant rights, but warns it is not a true fix. </span><span>“It’s not a permanent solution, but it’s opened a small window, and we have to take advantage of it as fast as we can,” she tells <em>Mother Jones</em>. “For a lot of people whose work permits are expiring, this is the news we needed to continue fighting for something more permanent, like the Dream Act.”</span><del></del></p>",

        "content": "<p>How much has income inequality increased over the past few decades? This is a matter of some contention, and the answer can depend on things like what inflation rate you use; whether you correct for household size; whether you measure consumption or income; and estimates of non-cash income like health benefits. My preference has always been to look at income shares so the inflation rate doesn’t matter; personal income so household size doesn’t matter; income rather than consumption; and to include as much non-cash income as possible.</p>\n<p>However, there’s always been another major critique of income numbers that has to do with technical changes made to tax laws in 1986. Dylan Matthews points to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/10/16850050/inequality-tax-return-data-saez-piketty\">recent paper on this subject:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>What looks on paper like a big increase in inequality in the 1980s and onward, Auten and Splinter argue, <strong>is really just money being shuffled around in response to Ronald Reagan-era changes to tax law.</strong> In 1980, the top individual income tax rate was 69.13 percent; by 1989, it had fallen by more than half, to 28 percent.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, companies usually reinvested their profits rather than giving raises to executives….Reinvesting the money ultimately benefited shareholders in the company by increasing the company’s value, and benefiting shareholders means benefiting rich people….After the tax cuts, companies started directing more money to raises. Rather than exploding actual inequality, Auten and Splinter write, <strong>the Reagan tax changes mostly shifted money that used to go to rich people through stocks so that it instead went to rich people in the form of salary.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a very technical argument that’s above my pay grade—though I’ll note that the wonks at the CBO don’t think it changes the overall numbers much. However, my own objection to it is fairly simple, and it might be wrong. But here it is anyway for public critique.</p>\n<p>The famous income series from Piketty and Saez is the basis for most of these arguments. These are the figures that Auten and Splinter think are overstated. But their critique applies solely to rich people. Workers in, say, the bottom 90 percent never got much income from capital gains and therefore weren’t plausibly affected by the Reagan-era tax changes. If we look solely at this share of the population, here’s what it looks like:¹</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_income_share_bottom_90.gif\" class=\"wp-image-545020\" height=\"501\"></figure>\n<p>Since 1973, the income share of the bottom 90 percent has declined from 47 percent to 32 percent. Obviously this means that the income share of the top 10 percent has increased from 53 percent to 68 percent. This is pretty consistent with an even bigger increase for the top 1 percent.</p>\n<p>Don’t take the precise numbers in the chart too seriously—they’re probably a little low across the board—but I think they’re roughly in the right ballpark and show the correct trend. Basically, the idea here is that the income share of the non-rich is easier to measure since it’s mostly wage income and isn’t affected by tax law changes or capital gains measurements. Whatever’s left must be the income of the rich, one way or another. If you do this, the 90-10 measure of income inequality has increased from 113 percent to 213 percent since 1973. That’s a lot.</p>\n<p>¹Since this is a tricky derivation, here are the details for data nerds. Income of the bottom 90 percent comes from Piketty &amp; Saez <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/\">here.</a> Table_Incomegrowth has the income figures and Table A0 has the historical series of total tax units (roughly the same as number of households). I multiplied average income by 90 percent of total tax units to get total income for the bottom 90 percent. National income is <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=hsiV\">here.</a> Piketty &amp; Saez use <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/home.htm\">CPI-U-RS</a> to create real income figures, so that’s what I used to deflate the national income numbers. (I spliced in chained PCE for 1973-77.) The share of total income for the bottom 90 percent is their real total income divided by real national income. The spreadsheet is <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_income_share_bottom_90.xlsx\">here.</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>The Supreme Court may be poised to green-light a controversial Ohio program that removes infrequent voters from the state’s registration lists. During oral arguments Wednesday morning, several justices seemed more concerned with preserving the state’s ability to remove people who had moved or died than they were with protecting eligible voters from being purged from the voter rolls.</p>\n<p>The high-stakes legal fight surrounding Ohio’s voter purge program is at the center of a larger <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/supreme-court-nvra-voter-registration/\" target=\"_blank\">battle</a> over access to the ballot. If the court allows Ohio to continue to remove voters based in part on their past failure to cast a ballot, other states will likely follow suit and millions of Americans across the country could find themselves disenfranchised because they have not recently voted. Supporters of the Ohio policy say it’s necessary to prevent voter fraud, but voting rights groups counter that such fraud is exceedingly rare and that the state’s voter purges are both error-prone and unfair, because they punish citizens who choose to exercise<b> </b>a constitutional right not to vote. There is also substantial evidence that the state purges minority voters and those from Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at disproportionately high rates.</p>\n<aside>“You think there is a constitutional right not to vote?” asked Roberts.</aside>\n<p>But the court’s conservative justices did not appear worried about the program’s fairness or the rights of voters who choose not to cast a ballot. “You think there is a constitutional right not to vote?” Chief Justice John Roberts skeptically asked Paul Smith, the counsel for the plaintiffs opposing Ohio’s policy. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito seemed to endorse the idea that non-voting could be a way to identify people who have moved or passed away. He posited the idea of a policy that targets voters for removal if they had not voted in 20 years, as opposed to Ohio’s practice of going after voters who have sat out the process for two years, as a case in which failure to vote might be a tool to suss out ineligible voters. “Isn’t that enough even to spark an inquiry?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Under Ohio’s current process, the state mails a confirmation notice to voters who have not cast a ballot in the previous two years. The notice asks that voters confirm their registration by responding to the notice, changing their registration online, or voting in the next four years. If they fail to take any of these actions, then the state removes them from the rolls. Hundreds of thousands of voters have been removed under the policy, despite the fact that many of them would otherwise be<strong> </strong>eligible to vote. The question before the court is whether this process violates a federal law, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993, that prohibits states from canceling a voter’s registration “by reason of the person’s failure to vote”</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen Breyer, who usually sides with the liberal justices, seemed notably skeptical of the plaintiffs’ arguments that Ohio’s program runs afoul federal law; he asked<b> </b>Smith a number of pointed questions. Breyer remarked that “dead people” on the voter rolls “used to be a big problem” and said, “I don’t believe Congress would have passed a statute that would prevent a state from purging a voting roll of people who have died or have moved out of the state.”</p>\n<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s frequent swing vote, also suggested Ohio was justified in removing voters in order to keep the rolls accurate. “The reason they’re purging them is they want to protect the voter roll from people that have moved, and they’re voting in the wrong district,” he said. “What we’re talking about are the best tools to implement that reason.” Overall, though, Kennedy was relatively quiet during the arguments, leaving his position unclear.</p>\n<p>Breyer asked Smith whether he had “hard” evidence to support his position that Ohio’s process for removing non-voters was overly broad and violated the NVRA. Smith said that of the 1.5 million notices Ohio sent to voters who missed an election, 1.2 million were ignored and not mailed back.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor gave voice to the concerns of voting rights advocates who worry that Ohio’s purge program disproportionately impacts minority voters and impinges on a core constitutional right.</p>\n<p>“Can we get to the essence of this case?” she said to Ohio Solicitor General Eric Murphy, who argued for the state. “Your reading [of the NVRA] is that failure to vote is enough evidence to suggest someone has moved.” But, she continued to prod, is that a “reasonable effort” since the process results in disproportionately disenfranchising minority voters?</p>\n<aside>“All of these impediments result in large numbers of people not voting in certain spots in the state,” Sotomayor noted.</aside>\n<p>Ohio has purged <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/as-the-gop-convention-begins-ohio-is-purging-tens-of-thousands-of-democratic-voters/\">2 million voters</a> since 2011; 840,000 of those purges have resulted from <a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/voting-rolls-may-not-restored-despite-court-ruling/L5BGfFl3GF4quXBsVA12MO/\">infrequent voting</a>. According to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-votingrights-ohio-insight/use-it-or-lose-it-occasional-ohio-voters-may-be-shut-out-in-november-idUSKCN0YO19D\">Reuters analysis</a>, Ohio has purged at least 144,000 voters in the state’s three largest counties—home to Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—since the 2012 election, with voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods twice as likely to be removed as those in Republican-leaning ones. Sotomayor also pointed to other restrictions on voting in Ohio, such as the elimination of the first week of early voting, when African Americans were <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2842265/OhioOrganizingCollab-FoFCoL.pdf\">five times likelier</a> than whites to cast a ballot, and long lines at the polls in cities such as Cleveland in past elections. “All of these impediments result in large numbers of people not voting in certain spots in the state,” Sotomayor noted.</p>\n<p>In response to Sotomayor, Murphy stressed that “nobody is removed because of their failure to vote…They’re removed because they failed to respond to a notice <em>and </em>failed to vote over a six year period.”</p>\n<p>“What is the evidence you have that people struck from the rolls have actually moved?” Sotomayor asked.</p>\n<p>The NVRA doesn’t require states to keep that evidence, Murphy responded.</p>\n<p>Sotomayor also sharply questioned the Trump administration’s decision to reverse the Obama Justice Department’s opposition to Ohio’s program. She noted that in the past, both Republican and Democratic administrations had interpreted the NVRA as prohibiting the use of non-voting as a reason to remove people from the rolls. “There’s a 24-year history of solicitor generals under both parties taking positions contrary to yours,” she told Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued for the US government. “It’s quite unusual your office would change its position so dramatically.”</p>\n<p>Francisco said there was a “public context” of confusion about how to interpret this part of the NVRA and that the administration interpreted the Help America Vote Act of 2002 as clearing up that ambiguity in favor of Ohio’s policy.</p>\n<p>“Do you believe this doesn’t have a disproportionate impact on certain groups in society?” Sotomayor asked.</p>\n<p>The NVRA “gives states flexibility” to remove voters from the rolls, Francisco responded.</p>\n<p>The larger significance of the case is that the NVRA—which not only limits how states can purge their voter lists but also requires states to allow people to register to vote at DMV offices and social service agencies—has a political target on its back. Republicans who seek to impose more hurdles to registration and voting in the name of fighting voter fraud, despite overwhelming evidence that fraud is extremely rare, likely need to weaken the NVRA in order to achieve their goals. “We’re seeing a coming fight over how voter rolls are maintained,” Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/supreme-court-nvra-voter-registration/\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em>Mother Jones </em>last week. “It’s a new front in the voter suppression battles.”</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court case Wednesday is part of that struggle. Legally, the case hinges on how the nine justices interpret the phrase “by reason of a person’s failure to vote.” But the bigger picture is about a political movement <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/these-three-lawyers-are-quietly-purging-voter-rolls-across-the-country/\" target=\"_blank\">agitating for aggressive purging</a> of voter rolls across the country.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his argument, Smith said that Ohio’s current program is similar to <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/the-supreme-court-is-about-to-hear-a-case-that-could-unleash-a-new-wave-of-voter-purges/\">purges that predate the NVRA</a>. With Ohio’s process, he said, “you end up with a system which looks an awful lot like the old Ohio ‘use it or lose-it’ system.”</p>",

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of the most liberal members of the chamber, asked if he would support “a clean DACA bill” that protects the dreamers with no other conditions, the president sounded amenable. <strong>“Yeah, I would like to do it,” Trump said.</strong></p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPjZLmmmHVw?feature=oembed\" width=\"990\" height=\"557\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Trump’s apparent concession so alarmed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that he interjected himself, although he was careful only to gently contradict the president….McCarthy apparently was not the only one concerned by Trump’s seeming agreement with Feinstein. <strong>When the White House released its official transcript Tuesday afternoon, the president’s line — “Yeah, I would like to do it” — was missing.</strong></p>\n<p>A White House official said that <strong>any omission from the transcript was unintentional</strong> and that the context of the conversation was clear.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Unintentional.” Sure it was. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/07/the-white-house-is-now-doctoring-its-transcripts-1/\">Just like it was last July.</a></p>\n<p>This episode shows not just that the White House is dishonest, but that it’s stupid. Doctoring a transcript to remove <em>the one line</em> that everyone gasped at in real time is idiotic. Apparently one of the new tasks of the press in the Trump era is going to be scouring White House transcripts for errors. Unintentional though they may be, surely we’re all interested in keeping these historical records accurate. Right?</p>",

        "content": "<p>With 10 Democrats up for reelection in states Donald Trump won, the party needs a lot to go right if it’s going to take back the Senate this year. But at least one big thing already has: The most vulnerable Democratic incumbents have almost universally avoided any kind of primary challenge. Even as the party lurches left, moderate Democrats in red states—such as Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly—are running without opposition from their party’s insurgent wing. In fact, the only Democratic senator to face a high-profile challenge from the left is Dianne Feinstein, in deep-blue California. </p>\n<p>But the Senate notwithstanding, 2018 is shaping up to be a big year for Democrats, and a series of high-stakes<strong> </strong>primary contests this spring and summer will determine what kind of party emerges when the dust settles in November. Many of the debates that have dogged the party over the past few years (and beyond)—the role for pro-life Democrats, the power of big-money donors, and the future of the Bernie Sanders coalition—will be playing out once again in various races across the country. Here’s a quick guide to some primaries to watch:</p>\n<p><b>IL-03:</b> Democrat Dan Lipinski has been a thorn in progressives’ side almost since he inherited the seat from his father, longtime Rep. Bill Lipinski, in 2004. Although the seat, which includes parts of southwest Chicago and the suburbs, is safely Democratic, the younger Lipinski is staunchly anti-abortion, has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and is a member of the centrist Blue Dog caucus. Activists have taken aim at the incumbent several times over the last decade, with little to show for their efforts. But this year Lipinski will face his toughest primary test—from businesswoman Marie Newman. The reproductive rights advocacy group NARAL, Democracy for America (the progressive organization founded by Howard Dean), and the LGBT rights group Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/16/dan-lipinski-conservative-democrat-election-299572\">are all<strong> </strong>backing Newman</a>, as is New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The March 20 primary will be a major test for activists who want the party to draw a clearer line on reproductive rights.</p>\n<p><b>California Senate:</b> For all the talk about do-nothing moderates, Democrats have mostly left their vulnerable Senate candidates alone. Perhaps that’s because, aside from early defections on Cabinet secretary confirmations, Senate Democrats have uniformly held the line on big votes in the Trump era. Democrats voted unanimously against GOP efforts to dismantle Obamacare and cut taxes, for example. But in deep-blue California, Sen. Dianne Feinstein wasn’t so lucky. The <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/04/dianne-feinstein-versus-donald-trump/\">26-year incumbent</a>, who has frustrated liberals with her moderation—and frustrated ambitious California Democrats by being a 26-year-incumbent—will face state Senate President <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/kevin-deleon-california-democrat/\">Kevin de Leon</a> in the June 5 open primary. Under California’s election rules, Democrats and Republicans compete in the same primary, and the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, move on to the general election. So there’s a good chance this race won’t be settled until November.</p>\n<p><b>Maryland Governor: </b>As hostile as the Senate map is for Democrats, the 2018 gubernatorial races offer huge opportunities. Republicans in 13 states carried twice by Barack Obama are either retiring or up for reelection. Maryland is among the bluest, and nine Democrats have signed up for a chance to take on GOP<strong> </strong>Gov. Larry Hogan. The most notable Democratic contender is <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/the-most-important-election-of-2018-might-be-happening-in-maryland/\">former NAACP president Ben Jealous</a>, a high-profile Sanders supporter who is framing his campaign as an opportunity for Sanders’ movement to score a big electoral win and turn Maryland into a laboratory for progressive politics.</p>\n<p><b>Illinois Governor: </b>Billionaire Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner had a whopping $68 million in his campaign account as of last fall, which all but guarantees that the general election will be one of the most expensive<strong> </strong>governor’s races ever. Democrats just might nominate a billionaire of their own. Hotel magnate J.B. Pritzker currently leads the field. Next in line is Chris Kennedy, son of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. State Sen. Daniel Biss, a former University of Chicago math professor, has tried to carve out a spot as a Sanders-style progressive, but his Democratic Socialist running mate, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, was <a href=\"https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2017/09/07/ramirez-rosa-dumped-off-the-biss-ticket-in-six-days-denies-flip-flop-on-israel-issue\">dropped from the ticket</a> because of his support of the BDS movement, which advocates economic boycotts and sanctions against Israel. The populist left is supposed to be ascendant right now, particularly in the Midwest; Illinois may test its limits.</p>\n<p><b>Georgia Governor: </b>It’s a testament to the changing Democratic map that one of the party’s toughest primary battles of 2018 involves a statewide election in Georgia. But the May primary between former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who is African American, and state Sen. Stacey Evans, who is white, has already exposed fault lines within the Democratic coalition. When Evans spoke at the Netroots Nation conference last fall, protesters chanting “support black women” interrupted her remarks and handed out literature comparing Evans to Trump Education Secretary Betsy Devos; Abrams issued <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/darrensands/stacey-abrams-wants-to-be-the-first-black-woman-governor?utm_term=.ocRg6L3J1#.kp96Em0Zw\">a lengthy defense</a> of the protesters. Abrams has the support of civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis; EMILY’s List, which helps elect pro-choice women; and Nina Turner, president of Sanders’ political organization Our Revolution. Evans is backed by ex-Gov. Roy Barnes (the last Democrat to win statewide in Georgia) and a smattering of Democrats who think Abrams has worked too closely with Republicans during her time in the state Legislature.</p>\n<p><b>Texas-07: </b>The resistance has hit this suburban Houston district hard. Four years after Mitt Romney trounced Obama by 21 points there, Hillary Clinton won the 7th District by 1.4 percentage points. Meanwhile,<strong> </strong>nine-term Republican Rep. John Culberson has been slow to prepare himself for what is shaping up to be the toughest race of his career. The 7th is an archetype of the kind of district Democrats think Trump-era Republicans are uniquely poised to underperform in—highly educated, affluent, and very diverse. But first, Democrats need to settle on a candidate. There is Jason Westin, an MD Anderson cancer doctor. There is Laura Moser, an activist who launched an app for calling members of Congress. There is Lizzie Fletcher, a lawyer backed by EMILY’s List. And there’s the millennial, Alex Triantaphyllis, a nonprofit director who has raised more money than any of them. The question facing voters there is a heightened, and perhaps more expensive, version of the one facing Democrats in swing districts elsewhere—<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/democrats-havent-won-this-district-since-the-60s-it-just-might-hold-the-key-to-taking-back-congress/\">what exactly should a Trump-era Democrat stand for</a>?</p>\n<p><b>PA-01:</b> The FBI is investigating allegations that longtime Philadelphia Democratic Rep. Bob Brady <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/politics/fbi-robert-brady-campaign-finance.html?_r=0\">paid off</a> a primary opponent to drop out of a race<strong> </strong>six years ago. Two of Brady’s consultants have already been charged in the case. But Brady has no plans to step aside, setting up yet another Philadelphia congressional primary focused on the ethics of an entrenched incumbent. (Rep. Chaka Fattah lost in a Democratic primary two years ago after being indicted on corruption charges; Fattah is now in federal prison.) Former Deputy Mayor Nina Ahmad has already loaned herself $600,000 for the race against Brady. An expensive fight against a machine politician in a critical swing state may not be the battle the Democratic establishment needs right now, but it’s the one they’ve got.</p>",

It was a Sunday morning in early June and he had just addressed a few thousand Bernie Sanders followers at the People’s Summit, a Chicago <a href=\"https://www.thepeoplessummit.org/#about\">gathering of lefty organizers</a>. It had been a long weekend of workshops and plenaries and the odd dance party, and Jealous, who is running for governor of Maryland, had helped close it out, speaking on a panel on electoral politics titled “Beyond Neo-Liberalism and Trumpism.” For three days organizers had tallied their victories and studied their setbacks, in an effort to understand where the Sanders-inspired movement was headed. In candidates like Jealous, they seemed to have an answer—the revolution was moving down the ballot.</p>\n<p>Jealous had other things on his mind as he rushed to the airport. The next day, his parents <a href=\"https://wtop.com/baltimore/2017/06/sudden-human-beings-reflections-50-years-loving-v-virginia/slide/1/\">would celebrate the 50th anniversary</a> of <em>Loving v. Virginia</em>, the Supreme Court decision that struck down interracial marriage bans, by renewing their vows at a Baltimore church. But his path to the convention-center taxi stand was blocked by one supporter after another. A twentysomething in a T-shirt that read, “Fuck it, I guess I’m a Democratic Socialist,” wanted a photo. A woman wanted to pass along a book from the author Naomi Klein. A nurse from California just kept saying, “You’re going to win! You’re going to win!”</p>\n<p>The 44-year-old is a difficult man to miss, towering and heavyset with short black hair and a thick goatee peppered with flecks of gray. He is rarely seen in public without suspenders, leaving you with the sense that you are talking to not just the youngest-ever ex-president of the NAACP, but also a lumberjack. In crowds, Jealous doesn’t walk so much as he parts the waters, like a boulder breaking up a rushing stream.</p>\n<p>Finally, he had shed the friendly organizers and the photo-seekers and the man who wanted to have “a couple-minute conversation” about universal basic income. He walked off an escalator, short of breath and sweating a little, into a white-linoleum-floored foyer somewhere in the bowels of the largest convention center in the country. “I don’t know where the fuck we are,” he said. “Do you?”</p>\n<p>It is a familiar sentiment these days. The 2016 election has thrown the Democratic Party and the political left into a series of struggles over the path forward. These fights—to obstruct or to compromise, to clean house or keep their leadership—are infused with a sense of foreboding about what three (or seven) more years in Donald Trump’s America might bring.</p>\n<p>Jealous approaches this moment of reckoning from a different direction than many of his Democratic peers, one that almost sounds like optimism. Even after their strong showing in November, Democrats face steep odds of breaking Republicans’ grip on Congress, but Jealous’ race is emblematic of an opportunity outside Washington: In 2018, 13 states that Barack Obama carried twice have Republican governors who are retiring or up for reelection. Winning governors’ mansions, Jealous says, is “the only way to move our families forward.”</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/431_20171122-jealous_10.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-535343\" height=\"641\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Ben Jealous shakes hands with admirers outside a restaurant moments before declaring his endorsements from Sens. Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker. </span></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His campaign is a product of two spectacular failures—the failure of t<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/06/why-anthony-brown-lost-in-maryland/?utm_term=.dca6ed2ae3bd\">hen-Democratic Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown</a> to win a slam-dunk gubernatorial race in 2014 against Republican real estate developer Larry Hogan, and the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/trump-wins/\">failure of Hillary Clinton</a> to win a slam-dunk race against another Republican real estate developer two years later. Without Clinton’s loss, the appetite for a Democratic Party reset would be considerably weaker; without several cycles of down-ballot losses, there wouldn’t be many places to try it.</p>\n<p>We emerged from the convention center by an underground loading dock. No cabs. His jacket now draped over his shoulder, Jealous consulted his iPhone and shrugged, setting off toward a pocket of sunlight. “As progressives, we’ve mourned the transfer of power from the federal government to the states over the last half-century,” he said, getting back to his point. “Well, this is that sort of a judo moment, where you decide to use your opponent’s momentum against them and say, ‘All right, fine. You guys want to put all the power in your states? Well, we’ll just get back to running our states.'”</p>\n<p>It is a simple-enough idea—<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-california-defund-sanctuary-city-tenth-amendment/\">federalism, but for liberals</a>—to make you forget, for a second, how radical of a proposition a Gov. Ben Jealous would be. No one who has led an organization like the NAACP has ever been in the position he could find himself in come January 2019, in charge of the very institutions—prisons, schools, courts—that organizations like the NAACP have spent more than a century trying to influence from the outside. Nor, for that matter, has anyone affiliated with Sanders’ movement. If Jealous can make history next fall as <a href=\"https://blackamericaweb.com/2017/06/29/will-maryland-voters-elect-a-black-governor/\">Maryland’s first black governor</a>, he’ll have the space to test-drive a revamped lefty politics that could show Democrats—and Berniecrats—how to make coalition politics work in a reactionary age. To some disaffected liberals, Jealous, a Rhodes scholar turned civil rights leader turned tech investor, represents a new hope. “We’re in this kind of post-Obama desert,” says the commentator Van Jones, an early backer, “and if you listen to Ben Jealous, he’s the closest thing to an oasis that I’ve heard or seen.” And yet, if Jealous is what comes next, the most surprising thing about his campaign may be that Sanders’ second wave doesn’t sound much like Sanders at all.</p>\n<p><span>Benjamin Todd Jealous</span> was born into a life of crime. In 1966, Ann Todd, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1Ktrgrts8\">descendant of enslaved Africans</a> from Madagascar, and Fred Jealous, whose <a href=\"http://blackleadership.virginia.edu/transcript/jealous-benjamin\">ancestors followed the Pilgrims to Massachusetts</a>, were two teachers living in Baltimore when they decided to get married. The <em>Loving</em> decision was still a year away, and 17 states, including Maryland, prohibited interracial marriage. Fred’s <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023831_2023829_2025184,00.html\">grandfather disinherited him</a> when he heard the news. Determined to push ahead, the wedding party formed a caravan to Washington, DC, where they could legally tie the knot.</p>\n<p>After the ceremony, Fred and Ann moved to California and settled in a quiet, almost entirely white town near Big Sur called Pacific Grove. Although Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1Ktrgrts8\">studied Jealous’ ancestry on his show <em>Finding Your Roots</em></a>, joked that he was the “whitest black man we’ve ever tested,” Jealous has never struggled with his identity, in part because of the circumstances in which his parents married. He is black, full stop, and the fact that Fred Jealous was disinherited for marrying Ann meant that the extended family Ben knew in his youth were mostly black, too. Jealous spent summers with his mother’s parents in Baltimore and has lived back East most of his adult life, but he has not fully left California behind—he learned to surf and stopped eating meat after a rigorous propaganda campaign from his sister about veal calves when he was five.</p>\n<p>Jealous’ political baptism came in 1988, when as a short, stuttering 14-year-old, he <a href=\"http://blackleadership.virginia.edu/transcript/jealous-benjamin\">registered voters</a> for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign. Jackson’s candidacy is remembered now for its historic nature—he was the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/jesse-jackson-and-his-campaign/\">first black candidate</a> to win a contested primary—but it also created a lasting blueprint for progressive insurgencies. Jackson showed that a lefty coalition of working-class white and black voters, without support from party leaders, could unite under a banner of economic populism and civil rights and be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>Jackson lost the election but won the argument. Jealous, whose five-year-old son is named for the reverend, watched the next year as two African American followers of Jackson—<a href=\"http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1989/year_to:1989/office_id:3\">Doug Wilder</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/nyregion/the-1989-elections-the-new-york-vote-almost-lost-at-the-wire.html?pagewanted=all\">David Dinkins</a>—won elections in Virginia and New York City. Candidates tend to shirk historical comparisons, but Jealous’ run is explicitly based on one: Bernie is 1988, and he is 1989.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/431_20171122-jealous_11.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-535344\" height=\"641\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Ben Jealous talks to a crowd of people at local restaurant Busboys and Poets.</span></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“Jackson’s campaign says you can make social movements matter with a campaign; Wilder and Dinkins showed you could make social movements stronger and win,” he told me. “In each case they started out with the ashes of a failed presidential primary bid and would build a coalition that was much larger and much more inclusive—and that’s fundamentally what we’re doing here.”</p>\n<p>Jealous’ politics fell into a Jacksonian mold from there, and he wound up at Columbia University in New York City, where Dinkins was mayor, and where Thurgood Marshall’s successor at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Jack Greenberg, then serving as the dean of students, got him a work-study job at the LDF. Jealous became a <a href=\"https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/archive/mar_apr09/features2\">fixture in the classroom and on the quad</a>, marching against the Gulf War and burning Christopher Columbus in effigy. “Ben has a significant presence,” says Carlton Long, a former Columbia professor who remains close with him. “He showed up to campus wearing his letterman jacket with his last name on the back, and that created a little bit of consternation among students. ‘Is this a message? Does he think we all <em>envy</em> him?'”</p>\n<p>Living in New York also brought him closer to his godbrother, the comedian Dave Chappelle, whose father was best friends with Fred. Jealous was such a ubiquitous presence at Chappelle’s Manhattan comedy gigs that he was known to bystanders simply as “<a href=\"http://bigthink.com/videos/being-dave-chappelles-puerto-rican-bodyguard\">Chappelle’s Puerto Rican bodyguard</a>.” (One of his first fundraisers featured a meet and greet with the comic.)</p>\n<p>At Columbia, Jealous befriended another <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/us/garcetti-new-los-angeles-mayor-reflects-changing-city.html\">Californian with a mixed racial background</a> and an activist streak, Eric Garcetti, and they teamed up in a series of clashes with the administration. The duo staked out a university-owned convenience store to catch the clerks refusing service to the homeless, and when Columbia’s trustees were considering scrapping need-blind admission, Jealous and Garcetti helped organize a blockade of the building where the meeting took place. Stylistically, they represented contrasting approaches to the same ends. Garcetti, the son of then-LA District Attorney Gil Garcetti, conducted back-channel negotiations; Jealous climbed through a window to crash the meeting. “Maybe they thought I was quote-unquote ‘somebody reasonable,'” says Garcetti, now the mayor of Los Angeles. “They might have seen him as more radical.” In the end, the program was saved, but Jealous was put on notice.</p>\n<aside>“We’re in this kind of post-Obama desert,” says Van Jones. “He’s the closest thing to an oasis.”</aside>\n<p>Jealous, however, was not one to heed requests to mute his activism. Determined to stop the university from tearing down the ballroom where Malcolm X was shot, Jealous led another blockade of an administration building, preventing Greenberg from leaving until he and his fellow protesters had listed their demands. He was kicked off campus for a semester.</p>\n<p>For a time he wasn’t sure he’d be back at all. In 1993, Jealous moved to Mississippi, taking an $85-a-week job as an organizer in Jackson, where the Republican governor had proposed eliminating the state’s historically black public universities (HBCUs) to save money. (In the coup de grâce, one was to be replaced with a prison.) To a kid from Pacific Grove, Mississippi was another world, in which the 1860s, to say nothing of the 1960s, had never ended. Medgar Evers’ assassin was only just then standing trial, and the Ku Klux Klan had threatened to retaliate against the HBCU organizers if they continued their protest. Jealous spent a night in jail after one demonstration and narrowly avoided worse trouble when his friend Chappelle flew down for an event with a bag of weed in his duffel. They were later <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenJealous/status/794725959949807616\">pulled over and nearly arrested</a>; they were spared when one of the cops recognized Chappelle—”Boy, didn’t I see you on <em>Def</em> [<em>Comedy</em>] <em>Jam</em> last night?”</p>\n<p>Much of the work on the ground was still being done by old-line civil rights activists, such as the <a href=\"http://targetmarketnews.com/storyid07090701.htm\">crusading newspaper editor Charles Tisdale</a>, who after the successful organizing campaign would hire Jealous as an investigative reporter at his paper, the <em>Jackson Advocate</em>. The <em>Advocate</em>‘s offices had been <a href=\"http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/319.html\">firebombed twice by the Klan in the 1980s</a> and would be <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/publisher-firebombed-newspaper-suspects-retaliation\">torched again three years</a> after Jealous left. “He doubled our security,” Alice Tisdale, the publisher, joked of Jealous, who quickly worked his way up to managing editor.</p>\n<p>Most of Jealous’ <em>Advocate</em> bylines were incremental attempts to correct a deliberately broken system of justice—one series of articles helped clear a black farmer who’d been wrongly accused of arson; another compelled the state to relocate an inmate who’d testified against a homicidal guard. “The Bible talks about [how] you really have to <em>hate</em> injustice, you have to hate evil, and you have to have a burning inside of you,” Tisdale says. “And I think Ben realizes that.” But Jealous also saw glimmers of hope. He often describes an encounter late one night at a Waffle House. He and a few HBCU organizers were sitting in a booth when a rough-looking white man walked over with a carryout bag. The man recognized them from the local news; he called them “boys” and used the word “nigger.” It had been a long day, and they were on edge. They thought he was about to pull a gun—but instead he shook their hands and offered to write them a check.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/431_20171122-jealous_12.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-535347\" height=\"641\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>People make their way to the Galilee Baptist Church in Suitland, Maryland, for the National Capital Baptist Convention where Ben Jealous, along with other political figures, will speak to church members in the community.</span></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It sounds like a parable out of a motivational speech (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpVowWU6hLo\">it is</a>), but it’s central to what Jealous is selling now, when he pumps black voters with stories about a Maya Angelou-quoting white guy he met in the Baltimore suburbs, or a Trump-voting single-payer supporter on the Eastern Shore. <em>Don’t assume you know who your allies are. </em>His mantra: “If you are comfortable in your coalition, your coalition is too small.”</p>\n<p>Jealous returned to Columbia after two years down South, more focused on his studies but still uncertain about his future. “I used to wonder what direction his life would go,” says Judith Russell, a Columbia professor whom Jealous considered a mentor. “He just has a sensitivity to him about ethical matters that’s kind of spiritual.” He started working for the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and was increasingly involved with the Episcopal Church. His grades improved, and after graduating two years late in 1996, he followed Garcetti to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. (The two have remained close; Jealous even wore Garcetti’s graduation gown at his Oxford commencement.) Before he left for England, <a href=\"https://charlierose.com/videos/7565\">Jealous and a few Rhodes scholars appeared on <em>Charlie Rose</em></a> to discuss the future. It was a showcase for America’s brightest young things in an era of economic prosperity, but Jealous’ forecast was overcast. Jealous couldn’t shake the suspicion, he said, “that this social revolution might have taken a bad turn—that a lot of the people who may 20 years ago have gone into public interest law now are going to Wall Street.”</p>\n<p>When he returned to New York, Jealous spent a year training to be a priest and moved into a home in Harlem for people with addictions who had been diagnosed with HIV, a period he describes as a “<a href=\"http://blackleadership.virginia.edu/transcript/jealous-benjamin\">spiritual antidote to the decadence of Oxford</a>.” Jealous’ experiences in New York and Mississippi had nurtured a “profound sense of betrayal,” he later told Julian Bond, <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/oldest-and-boldest/julian-bond/\">the iconic civil rights leader</a> and longtime NAACP chairman. The children of the civil rights generation had been told “that the playing field was now fair,” but instead they were coming of age “just in time to find ourselves the most murdered generation in this country, the most incarcerated generation on the planet.”</p>\n<p>Notably, though, at a time when many of his peers were drifting away from the old-guard civil rights institutions, Jealous embraced them. Inspired by his experiences with the Tisdales, he spent three years as executive director of an association of black newspaper publishers—the informational lifeblood of the civil rights era that had fallen on hard times at the end of the millennium. That stint was followed by three years as the director of the US human rights program at Amnesty International. The group’s signature accomplishment during his tenure was the abolition of the juvenile death penalty—another example, as he tells it, of the virtues of coalition-building. The objective was to get a majority of states to ban the sentence, so that the Supreme Court could find it “unusual” (in addition to “cruel”). First, organizers from campus Amnesty and NAACP groups hit on the idea to join forces with campus pro-life groups. Then, instead of focusing their energies on moderate lawmakers, they appealed to rock-ribbed conservatives and liberals alike. It sounds like a <em>West Wing</em> plot, but it worked, and in places where groups like Amnesty did not generally have much sway—their biggest victories were in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/opinion/juveniles-and-the-death-penalty.html\">South Dakota</a> and <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/wyoming-1\">Wyoming</a>.</p>\n<aside>His mantra: “If you are comfortable in your coalition, your coalition is too small.”</aside>\n<p>By the time he took over the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/naacp-chooses-youngest-president-ever/\">NAACP in 2008 at the age of 35</a>, the national mood had shifted. Barack Obama was ascendant, and even some African Americans were wondering about the purpose of an aging civil rights group in the age of a black president. Jealous’ predecessor spoke freely of a “<a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/other-black-president\">post-civil rights</a>” era. A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10politics-t.html\"><em>New York Times Magazine</em> profile of Jealous</a> and other young black political leaders asked if Obama marked “the end of black politics.”</p>\n<p>The selection process brought many of these anxieties to the surface. Critics seized on <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bal-benjamin-jealous-archives-story-story.html\">Jealous’ age</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blackvoicenews.com/2008/08/20/taking-a-second-look-at-bi-racial-black-leaders/\">light skin</a>, and lack of connections to the black church (an ironic complaint, given his still-recent flirtation with the priesthood). “He has had no presence in black leadership at all,” <a href=\"https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Choice-of-New-NAACP-Leader/165819\">fretted one San Francisco minister</a>. “At best, he has been a technocrat.” But Bond, <a href=\"https://snccdigital.org/events/julian-bond-runs-for-seat-in-georgia-legislature/\">who was just 25 when he was elected</a> to the Georgia Legislature, was impressed by Jealous and saw his youth as an asset. “Ben’s selection would not have happened but not for Julian Bond,” says Wade Henderson, an NAACP veteran who served on the selection committee. Nor was Jealous entirely unfamiliar to the organization, having worked for the Legal Defense Fund in college—historically the NAACP’s more pugilistic arm. (It was at the LDF where Jealous <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/style/weddings-lia-epperson-benjamin-jealous.html\">met his now ex-wife</a>, Lia Epperson, a civil rights attorney.)</p>\n<p>Jealous viewed the Obama era as an opportunity to reorient the organization. The NAACP had accomplished a lot in its 100-plus years, but it had long harbored a conservative streak. Some board members wanted the organization to transition toward community services—rather than attacking structural racism—and placed a premium on respectability politics. The year before Jealous arrived, the NAACP held a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/09/AR2007070900609.html\">funeral for the N-word</a>. Not for the first time, it faced a generational divide. Younger activists, to whom the idea of a racial end-of-history seemed absurd, were gravitating to more combative groups such as Van Jones’ Color of Change. “It was a train wreck inside a circus on a sinking ship,” Jones says. “They were running out of money. They were not taking on relevant issues. They were just kind of an internally focused dinosaur.”</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/431_112117_jealous_b_960.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-534427\" height=\"641\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Jealous discusses his plan to end mass incarceration by using the saved funds for education.</span></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But Jealous was a member of that restless generation himself. Although he admires Obama and the two have some obvious similarities—”We graduated from the same college, we have a white parent and a black parent, we’re both distant cousins to Dick Cheney,” as Jealous puts it—he bristled at the idea that one leader would change much on his own. “History has proven the fallacy of the Moses archetype for black leadership,” he told reporters the day before Obama’s inauguration. Obama often shied from tackling white supremacy head-on. Under Jealous, the NAACP would have no such inhibitions.</p>\n<p>He placed the group at the fore of high-profile civil rights cases. When Trayvon Martin was shot, he <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/os-george-zimmerman-trayvon-naacp-rally-sanford-20120331-story.html\">all but moved to Sanford, Florida</a>, to fight stand-your-ground laws. But his biggest successes again involved unlikely coalitions. He signed on to a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42250811/ns/business-careers/t/wal-mart-sex-bias-case-could-have-wide-impact/#.WgNAiNOGM6h\">gender discrimination lawsuit against Walmart</a>—typically outside the NAACP’s purview—and used that as leverage to convince the nation’s largest private employer to hire ex-convicts. In 2012 and 2013 in Maryland, where the organization was headquartered, the NAACP helped pass <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-jealous-20131229-1-story.html\">marriage equality</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/md-voters-deciding-on-dream-act-law/2012/11/06/d539fe66-282f-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_story.html?utm_term=.313f793e2e49\">DREAM Act</a>, and the <a href=\"https://archive.is/20130624185425/http://news.yahoo.com/maryland-governor-signs-bill-abolishing-death-penalty-153909799.html\">abolition of the death penalty</a>—an intersectional triple play that Jealous rattles off to almost everyone he meets. “Marriage equality was not something that was necessarily easily solved, particularly in an organization where the clergy plays an important role in the leadership,” Henderson says. “Ben used personal capital to make that happen.” By the time he left in 2013, citing stresses on his family, the organization’s membership numbers were back on the rise and its fundraising was booming. The biggest complaint upon his departure was that he had left too soon.</p>\n<aside>“The guy was all-in. He was an incredibly important player in the campaign,” says Sanders’ campaign manager.</aside>\n<p>But there were bumps along the way. In 2010, Andrew Breitbart <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/07/19/video-proof-the-naacp-awards-racism-2010/\">published a video</a> on his fledgling conservative news site of an Agriculture Department employee named Shirley Sherrod appearing to boast to an NAACP chapter about discriminating against a white farmer. Speaking for the organization, Jealous said he was “appalled” by her comments. But <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22sherrod.html\">Sherrod’s remarks had been edited</a>—in the next breath, she had talked about getting past her impulse and helping the farmer anyway. The NAACP retracted its statement. Jealous <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/20/agriculture.employee.naacp/index.html\">said he’d been “snookered.”</a></p>\n<p>When I asked him about the episode, he pointed at the clock on his phone, to indicate that our interview had gone longer than it should, and then went silent for a moment. Jealous is a commanding public speaker today in part because he is, by nature, a terrible one. He struggled with a severe stutter into his 20s, and to avert this, he often pauses mid-thought for seconds at a time, as if he is searching for just the right word. “I learned the power of being deliberate,” he said. “And the value of saying, ‘I was wrong, I apologize,’ quickly.” The fiasco marked the beginning of a friendship between Jealous and the Sherrods. The couple ran a public land trust near their home in Albany, Georgia, and in 2011, Jealous drove down from Maryland and spent part of his vacation living and working on a farm they had recently acquired. He dropped by again last year. “People wanted to feel that they were protecting the president,” Sherrod says. She forgave Jealous immediately. But, Jealous says, “that was the lowest moment of my professional career.”</p>\n<p><strong><span>During the</span></strong> Obama years, Jealous found a receptive audience and willing partner in the White House, and in particular at <a href=\"http://www.thetaskforce.org/naacp-president-ben-jealous-opening-keynote-address-at-creating-change/\">Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department</a>. But he also found the Obama years frustrating. When rumors began circulating in 2016 that Jealous would endorse Sanders, Clinton confidante <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23508\">Neera Tanden told a colleague</a> that “he’s really hung up on Obama not caring about black people.” (The email was later published by WikiLeaks.) That wasn’t quite true, but it was clear he thought things were moving too slowly. In an appearance on <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50605316/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/january-paul-ryan-jim-demint-ben-jealous-bob-woodward-andrea-mitchell-ted-koppel/#.WgjJ_NOGM6i\"><em>Meet the Press</em> </a>shortly after Obama’s second inaugural in 2013, Jealous noted that after four years, the black unemployment rate was a full point higher than it had been when the president took office. Meanwhile, the fundamentals of American racial and economic inequality were unchanged. “It’s almost a certainty that the kids coming out of college will be worse off than their parents,” he lamented <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?319783-1/poor-can-save-capitalism&start=946\">months after he left the NAACP.</a></p>\n<p>It was not especially surprising, given his career arc, that Jealous would back Sanders. He found Clinton’s continuing support for <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ben-jealous-argues-bernie-sanders\">capital punishment archaic</a>, and her <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ben-jealous-argues-bernie-sanders\">decades-old comment</a> that preteen “super-predators” necessitated a crime bill was “not just a violation of psychology, [but] a violation of theology.” Perhaps most gravely, Jealous worried she would cede too much ground to the opposition in the interest of finding consensus—something that flew against his entire coalitions theory of change. Jealous believed the moment demanded an “idealist” who could speak critically of the American system to people who felt excluded from it, and such a candidate would necessarily come from outside the political establishment. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-ben-jealous-endorsement-218734\">Jealous endorsed Sanders</a> in early February 2016 and almost immediately took a place in the senator’s inner circle, popping up at strategy meetings and introducing the candidate almost everywhere he went. “They come from different generations, they come from different backgrounds, [but] the two of them clicked very quickly,” says Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager and longtime consigliere. “The guy was all-in. He was an incredibly important player in the campaign.”</p>\n<p>Jealous’ work for Sanders is one of the first things he mentions everywhere he goes these days, and his agenda reflects the leftward lurch in the Democratic Party since November 2016—Medicare for all, universal pre-K, free college, a $15 minimum wage, and an end to the war on drugs. Of the hundreds of Sanders-backed candidates seeking office, from Deep South mayoralties to big-city district attorneys, Jealous is the highest-profile, and his is the race where Sanders himself has the most skin in the game. Sanders endorsed Jealous last July, 11 months before the primary, and has made several visits to the state to campaign. Should Sanders decline to run in three years, Jealous might be the closest thing to a passing of the torch.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/431_20171122-jealous_13.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-535364\" height=\"641\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Jealous enters the Galilee Baptist Church in Suitland, Maryland, where he is scheduled to speak at this year’s National Capital Baptist Convention. </span></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But Jealous is not Sanders redux. The Vermont senator has a tendency to see economic and racial inequality as two distinct crises, with the former taking up far more oxygen than the latter. He had <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/how-bernie-sanders-lost-black-voters-1793860129\">made few inroads in communities of color</a> prior to running, and his candidacy, in hindsight, was doomed to demographic failure. Sanders’ coalition widened as the presidential campaign went on, and Jealous took an active role in helping to broaden his support—<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/us/politics/in-a-black-church-in-south-carolina-bernie-sanders-struggles-to-get-an-amen.html?_r=0\">ushering him around South Carolina</a> and cutting a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48cVv8zzo0I\">minutelong ad set in West Baltimore</a>—but it didn’t always look like a rainbow coalition.</p>\n<p>Jealous doesn’t have that problem. He has spent his career articulating the ways in which economic and government institutions are built to keep racial minorities down. That frees him up to more closely emulate his idol Jackson, to build a coalition that gets each faction interconnected with the others. When he meets with black audiences, he makes a point of describing the conditions in Cumberland, Maryland, a largely white railroad town afflicted by the opioid epidemic and dead-end jobs. When he meets with white audiences, he tells them about the McCulloh Homes housing project in West Baltimore where his mother grew up.</p>\n<p>“I typically talk about race and class in the same breath, not as the same thing, because they’re not, but as parallel struggles that are interconnected, interwoven,” he told me when we met again in September. He was sitting in the lobby of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, <a href=\"http://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jealous\">where he is a visiting professor</a>. “Look, the Democratic Party practiced identity politics for a reason, which is that if you signal to different groups that you heard their concerns before you got there, they’re more likely to listen to the rest of what you have to say.”</p>\n<aside>“Donald Trump will take care of Larry Hogan,” Jealous says.</aside>\n<p>The other major difference is his economic message itself. Jealous is not a socialist—he’s a venture capitalist who believes in the power of markets to instigate social change. He had expected to spend his post-NAACP career teaching, or launching an Emily’s List-style incubator for candidates of color. Instead, he ended up as <a href=\"http://www.kaporcapital.com/who-we-are/benjamin-jealous/\">a partner at the Baltimore office of a firm called Kapor Capital</a>. The VC arm of the organization, where Jealous works, invests in companies—usually firms founded by women or people of color—whose services target communities whose needs are not being met by Silicon Valley or anyone else. (It has a nonprofit sister organization, the Kapor Center, that funds philanthropic ventures directly.) “Every single problem that a rich person in San Francisco has, some startup is solving,” Jealous told a conference in 2014, not long after taking the job. He wanted to apply the startup world’s enthusiasm for solving first-world problems to actual first-world problems.</p>\n<p>Jealous name-drops companies like LendUp—”which is disrupting the payday lending space”—and Honor, an Uberlike app that is “disrupting the middleman in the home health care industry.” His favorite of the bunch is a company called Pigeonly, which was founded by a former drug trafficker to slash the exorbitant cost of calling into prison (sometimes as much as $14 a minute) through a setup similar to Skype. At the NAACP, Jealous had pushed for regulations to curb the cost of prison phone calls by 50 percent, but Pigeonly, he points out, has already <a href=\"http://frederickhutson.com/\">cut it by 80 percent</a>.</p>\n<p>It is hardly the stuff of Mitt Romney-era Bain Capital, but it is also difficult to imagine Bernie Sanders ever talking about the Uber for home care services. A defining lesson of the Sanders campaign was that you could run as an openly socialist candidate and many people wouldn’t care. That’s meaningful. It is already shifting the boundaries of debate within the Democratic Party considerably to the left. But the takeaway wasn’t that the only way to energize progressives was to run a socialist candidate. If Jealous, at the crest of Sanders’ second wave, can take down a popular Republican incumbent, it might offer a lesson for how other Democrats can assemble their own coalitions, to harness frustrated, shut-out working-class voices under a populist banner. Van Jones, who has known Jealous since they worked in college with the AIDS activist group ACT UP to protest President Bill Clinton’s ban of Haitian refugees, compares the campaign in Maryland to Deval Patrick’s 2006 gubernatorial run in Massachusetts. “Every single theme that he hit wound up being almost a carbon copy for the Obama campaign in 2008,” Jones says. “You could have another Deval Patrick effect, where in the middle of the Bush horror, somebody kind of figured out a pathway and pattern.”</p>\n<p><strong><span>In September,</span></strong> I met up with Jealous for a weekend on the trail in Prince George’s County and Baltimore. He was locking in a string of endorsements—including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the Service Employees International Union, and a group of black pastors—that showed the contours of a unifying coalition nine months before the primary.</p>\n<p>Nine other Democrats have signed up to run, but Jealous was not particularly concerned about any of them, nor was he worried about Gov. Hogan, who consistently <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-hogan-approval-goucher-poll-20170923-story.html\">ranks as one of America’s most popular governors</a>. Hogan, who has been <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-hogan-final-chemo-treatment-20161003-story.html\">battling advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a> for most of his first term, never endorsed Trump and has managed, for the time being, to escape the stench emanating from Washington. Maryland may be broadly Democratic, but it packs a range of influences into a small area—Appalachian in the west, tobacco country in the east, and two major population centers along I-95: an ailing Rust Belt city in Baltimore and the booming suburbs of DC. In 2014, Hogan took advantage of those fault lines. He <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2014-election/results/map/governor/maryland/#.Wgjo19OGM6h\">flipped white working-class enclaves in historically</a> blue Baltimore County (which surrounds but does not include the city), and ran up huge margins in the east and west while black voter turnout cratered. “He was an outsider candidate who ran on a message of change in this state, and he spoke to those communities who have been hungry for change, whereas the Democratic nominee did not,” says Larry Stafford Jr., a Democratic campaign veteran who is now the executive director of Progressive Maryland. “Maryland was a forecast for what happened in the 2016 election.”</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/431_20171122-jealous_15.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-535366\" height=\"641\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>After speaking at the National Capital Baptist Convention, Jealous and Reverend Charles W. McNeill, Jr. join church members for a group picture.</span></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Jealous doesn’t dispute Hogan’s appeal but points to polls showing that a significant number of Marylanders who view Hogan favorably won’t say they’ll vote for him—a sign that things could go south in a bad year for Republicans, as 2018 is expected to be. “Donald Trump will take care of Larry Hogan,” Jealous says.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jealous was piecing together his coalition a few voters at a time. A Q&amp;A with African American clergy in Hyattsville was followed by a cookout at the McCulloh Homes, which outsiders might recognize as the low-rises from <em>The Wire</em>. Jealous was at the housing project for the second time in a month. He relaxed in striped suspenders with his 11-year-old daughter, Morgan, by his side, joking with the pitmaster about tofu and signing copies of his book, <em>Reach: 40 Black Men Speak on Living, Leading, and Succeeding</em>.</p>\n<p>At a farmers market the next morning, he stopped to inspect the merchandise at a stand selling oversize hula-hoops. The owner announced that “the next governor of Maryland” was about to test his wares—the sort of impromptu photo op that can haunt a candidate—and Jealous, shrugging, picked up a ring that could fit comfortably around a midsize sedan and twirled. “Oh my God,” someone shouted.</p>\n<p>Jealous chugged a chocolate milk (“the breakfast of champions”) and continued on his walk, passing a juvenile courthouse, where two men were sitting on the sidewalk watching the Ravens on a phone. Players on both teams had kneeled for the national anthem at the start of the game, so Jealous vented about <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/trump-takes-on-stephen-curry-and-colin-kaepernick-in-series-of-rage-tweets/\">Colin Kaepernick</a>. “I’m tired of them keeping him from playing,” he said. “It’s just like they did Muhammad Ali.”</p>\n<p>Finally, after stopping by a Unitarian church, he came face to face with his own handiwork—a smooth, seven-foot-tall slab of granite in the middle of a public park. Since the late 19th century, the pedestal had supported a <a href=\"http://baltimoreplanning.wixsite.com/monumentcommission/taneymonument\">statue of former Chief Justice Roger Taney</a>, whose majority opinion in the <em>Dred Scott</em> decision declared that free African Americans were not US citizens and had no standing to sue in court. Two days after Heather Heyer was run over by a neo-Nazi in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists were protesting a proposal to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/benjealous/videos/vb.14960614435/10155028168119436/?type=2&theater\">Jealous had held a press conference</a> in front of the Taney statue, demanding it be not just taken down, but melted. Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-taney-statue-removed-20170818-story.html\">carted the statue off two days later</a>. Jealous marveled at the way the plaque had been unscrewed and removed, leaving no trace of its past life behind. “I wanted to take a photo standing on top of the platform,” he said. (He didn’t.)</p>\n<p>The statue, which Hogan initially opposed removing, had rankled Jealous not only because of what Taney stood for, but because it was just one more way in which historical memory had been distorted to enforce cultural dominance. In his theory of politics, an object in motion tends to return to its original state. “The mistake that those of us in the movement make,” Jealous said, “is we misremember the original state of race relations.”</p>\n<p>Americans might look at the starting point of race in America through the prism of <em>Roots</em> or <em>12 Years a Slave</em>, Jealous says, but he <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/09/01/benjamin-todd-jealous-on-gloucester-rebellion/2730559/\">goes back to a 1663 revolt</a> in the Virginia Tidewater community of Gloucester. What made the Gloucester County rebellion unique was that it was not a slave rebellion in a traditional sense—it was an alliance of enslaved Africans and Irish and English indentured servants. The casus belli was an edict that stipulated that their current status (that is, as enslaved or indentured) “shall convey to your children.”</p>\n<p>“As Americans from the very beginning, so long as we could hope that our children could be better off than us, we were willing to endure a lot—but the moment that it became clear that we were locked out from the American Dream, we would rebel together,” Jealous said.</p>\n<p>“And this is one of those moments.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>The 2016 US election wasn’t an anomaly. Russia targeted American democracy, but has also has ramped up cyberattacks and influence campaigns in recent years in Europe as well, making the continent a testing ground for Kremlin efforts to sway democratic elections—and for how democracies can fight back. On Wednesday, Democrats from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee working under Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the panel’s top Democrat, released a <a href=\"https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Cardin%20Russia%20Report%20Embargoed%20Committee%20Print.pdf\">report</a> that details what it calls “malign influence campaigns” by Russia in 19 European states in recent years. The report documents acts of war in Ukraine, a coup plot in Montenegro, hacked emails and social media bots, and it makes 10 sets of recommendations on how the US can stop similar attacks in the future. While the report’s top recommendation is also an admission of a major hurdle—”Assert Presidential Leadership and Launch a National Response”—the authors offer several lessons that US lawmakers can actually act on, even if the president continues to call Russian interference a hoax. </p>\n<h3>Call out or confront Russia on its attacks</h3>\n<p>The report lauds British Prime Minister Theresa May for publicly denouncing Russian efforts to influence the country’s 2016 Brexit vote, as well as others. ‘‘We know what you are doing,” May <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/europe/theresa-may-russia/index.html\">warned</a> Russian President Vladimir Putin in a November 2017 speech. “And you will not succeed.” May also announced that an intelligence and security parliamentary committee would be convened to investigate Russian meddling in the country. The authors suggest May’s actions raised British awareness of the problem and provided a strong warning against future adventurism in British affairs.</p>\n<p>In May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also confronted Putin in a reportedly tense meeting. Worried about Kremlin efforts to release documents <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36284447\">hacked</a> from the lower house of the Bundestag and her Christian Democratic Union party, she bluntly cautioned Putin that Germany would take ‘‘decisive measures” against interference in the German election through cyberattacks or disinformation. The report credits Merkel’s warning with successfully <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/world/europe/german-election-russia.html?_r=0\">preventing</a> Russia from aggressive interference in the country’s election last fall.</p>\n<h3>Crack down on Russia-based crime</h3>\n<p>Spain has worked aggressively to prosecute Russia-based organized crime groups that use the country for money laundering and other crimes, the report notes. And Spanish money laundering operations have specifically targeted officials close to Putin. In just one example, Spanish police gathered a case against Alexander Torshin—a Russian banker who <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kushner-failed-disclose-outreach-putin-ally-trump-campaign-n822021\">met</a> with Donald Trump Jr. last year in what was reportedly part of Russian outreach to Trump campaign officials—for alleged ties to a Russian organized crime and money-laundering ring. (Torshin, though, narrowly <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/alexander-torshin-donald-trump-jr-meeting-716095\">averted</a> arrest in 2013, perhaps due to a tip off, when he failed to board a flight to Mallorca where police planned to arrest him.) Spain’s investigation <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-pulled-out-of-meet-and-greet-with-conservatives-favorite-russian-a-suspected-mobster-060026495.html\">appears to have helped </a>stop a planned meeting between the Torshin and President Trump early last year, as White House aides scrubbed Torshin from an event guest list at the last minute after learning of his alleged ties. The report also suggests Spain’s efforts helped squeeze financing otherwise used to support Russian influence efforts.</p>\n<h3>Fight fake news</h3>\n<p>Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, all<strong> </strong>former Soviet states with sizable Russian-speaking minorities, have been aggressively targeted by what the report calls “supercharged” Kremlin “disinformation operations” for years. Citizens in the three countries have joined an informal network of citizens who work <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-baltic-elves-taking-on-pro-russian-trolls\">to</a> “expose the bullshit,” as the group’s Lithuanian founder put it, of Kremlin-linked internet trolls by countering Russian messaging online. These communities have been successful not just in cyberspace, but also in person by organizing counter-demonstrations at pro-Kremlin rallies in their respective countries. Their governments also employ state-level efforts to inform citizens of the malicious activities of Russia’s security services.</p>\n<h3>Get tough on spies</h3>\n<p>Estonia’s intelligence service, which has a reputation for success, practices a ‘‘zero tolerance’’ approach to illegal activities by Russian intelligence operatives within its country’s borders. Where many counterintelligence agencies downplay the arrest of intelligence agents or trade them back to Russia, the Estonians prosecute them to the maximum extent of the law. The agency also works to expose Russian skullduggery, publishing an annual report that reveals major counterintelligences cases and names organizations and people suspected of working with Russian intelligence services. “Exposing and publicizing the nature of the threat of Russian malign influence activities can be an action-forcing event that not only boosts public awareness, but also drives effective responses from the private sector, especially social media platforms, as well as civil society and independent media, who can use the information to pursue their own investigations,” the report explains.</p>\n<h3>Make smarter citizens</h3>\n<p>Nordic states have adopted what the report calls an innovative “whole of society” approach to fighting Russian influence efforts, meaning that their schools teach critical thinking and “digital competence,” or how to differentiate between reliable and unreliable news sources online. The Swedish government has even <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20170116/why-this-swedish-comic-hero-is-going-to-teach-kids-about-fake-news-bamse\">deployed</a> “Bamse the Bear, a popular cartoon character,” the report notes, “to teach children about fake news and the need to cross check sources of information.” </p>\n<h3>Work with the media to counter disinformation</h3>\n<p>While European states can respond to false stories with methods less likely to fly in the United States, some steps they take to work with the press and social media companies could succeed here, the report suggests. In the run-up to France’s 2017 presidential election, local media companies—in addition to complying with a government instruction not to publish the contents of material hacked from the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron—collectively <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/opinion/keeping-the-kremlins-hands-off-frances-elections.html\">worked</a> to factcheck articles of websites that appeared unreliable. And nudged by French authorities, Facebook said in April 2017 that it had suspended 30,000 accounts for promoting propaganda or spam related to the French election. Meanwhile, in June 2017, Germany’s parliament <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/business/germany-facebook-google-twitter.html\">passed</a> controversial legislation that enabled large fines against social media companies that failed to quickly remove content considered illegal under the country’s stringent defamation and hate speech laws. Facebook then <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-crackdown-ahead-of-german-election-shows-its-learning/\">said</a> it removed tens of thousands of fake accounts working to influence the election, gave German candidates cybersecurity training, and cooperated with the country’s security office. These efforts likely helped reduce Russian influence in both countries’ elections last year.</p>\n<p>All these examples come from governments that did not benefit from, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/trump-putin-russia-scandal-guilty/\">ignore</a>, or<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/trump-putin-russia-scandal-guilty/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html\">encourage</a> Russian interference in their elections. Briefing reporters Tuesday on the report, a foreign relations staffer said that while many of their recommendations could be addressed through legislation, President Trump’s refusal to “even acknowledge the threat” remains a big obstacle to boosting American defenses. “President Trump is squandering an opportunity to lead America’s allies and partners,” the report says. But the authors argue that despite the president’s resistance, the US can still find ways to “deter and defend against the Kremlin’s use of its asymmetric arsenal.”</p>",

CNN even ran <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTCwrqJXUAItSeb.jpg\">live updates</a> on a potential “Oprah 2020” campaign on Monday. President Donald Trump told reporters he doubts Winfrey will run, though he also <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/trump-beat-oprah-winfrey-329507\">declared he would win</a> a campaign against her. </p>\n<p>Some progressives <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/the-memo/368016-oprah-buzz-sparks-debate-about-celebrity-presidents\">welcomed the idea</a> that Winfrey, a popular media icon whose star power could eclipse even that of Trump, might take on the president in 2020. Winfrey, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/08/oprah-for-president-in-2020-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/?utm_term=.8fc7c8135e27\">endorsed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton</a>, is well know for championing a wide range of important causes, such as <a href=\"https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2011/05/25/reading-for-life-oprah-winfrey/\">promoting reading</a> and founding the <a href=\"https://www.owla.co.za\">Leadership Academy for Girls</a> in Johannesburg, South Africa. But there’s one area in which Winfrey and her would-be opponent are surprisingly alike: Both she and Trump have helped spread the inaccurate—and dangerous—myth that vaccines cause autism or other health problems.</p>\n<aside>“This is the autism shot, isn’t it?”</aside>\n<p>The supposed link between autism and vaccines has been repeatedly and unequivocally debunked by scientists and public health officials. (See <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/pdf?ext=.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/cdcstudiesonvaccinesandautism.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sabin.org/updates/blog/vaccines-dont-cause-autism-0\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/four-vaccine-myths-and-where-they-came\">here</a>, for starters.) The theory has roots in an error-filled (and later retracted) 1998 British <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/\">study</a> claiming a link between autism and vaccines. Following the paper’s publication, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html\">dropped in Britain</a>, and measles cases rose sharply in the ensuing years. Researchers <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120604142726.htm\">reported</a> a decline in US vaccination rates. Years later, the discredited theory continues to negatively impact <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/us/a-discredited-vaccine-studys-continuing-impact-on-public-health.html?_r=0\">public health</a>.</p>\n<p>Winfrey’s role in this controversy dates back to 2007, when she <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/mothers-battle-autism/all#ixzz53cqpWT2j\">brought Jenny McCarthy</a>, the <i>Playboy</i> model and actress, onto her show to talk about autism. McCarthy’s young son, Evan, had suffered a series of seizures at two-and-a-half years old and was later diagnosed with autism. McCarthy was adamant that the MMR vaccination Evan received as a baby caused his autism. On the show, McCarthy told Oprah she had been instinctually uncomfortable with allowing the doctor to give her son the vaccine. “I said to the doctor, I have a very bad feeling about this shot,” McCarthy recounted. “This is the autism shot, isn’t it?”</p>\n<p>On the show, McCarthy’s claims went largely unchallenged. Winfrey praised McCarthy as a “mother warrior” and plugged her book<em> Louder Than Words: A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism</em>, which inaccurately suggests childhood vaccinations contribute to autism. Winfrey did read a brief statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said there was no scientific evidence of a connection and that scientists were continuing to study the causes of autism. “It is important to remember, vaccines protect and save lives. Vaccines protect infants, children and adults from the unnecessary harm and premature death caused by vaccine-preventable diseases,” the CDC statement concluded. But McCarthy had the final word. “My science is named Evan, and he’s at home,” she said. “That’s my science.”</p>\n<p>CNN’s <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/topic/entertainment/television/larry-king-PECLB0000005449-topic.html\" title=\"Larry King\">Larry King</a> and <a href=\"http://celebritybabies.people.com/2007/09/18/jenny-mccarth-1-2/\"><em>People</em></a><em> </em>magazine also gave attention to McCarthy and her views. She became a semi-regular guest on Winfrey’s show and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jenny-mccarthy-oprah-production-deal-217009\">signed a deal</a> with Winfrey’s Harpo Studios to create her own show, though that show ultimately fell through.<strong> </strong>McCarthy <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jenny-mccarthy-i-am-not-anti-vaccine\">says</a> she is not anti-vaccine but, rather, an advocate for “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/04/16/jenny-mccarthy-says-she-isnt-anti-vaccine-here-are-some-other-things-she-has-said-about-vaccinations/?utm_term=.e0c112eccc57\">safe vaccines</a>.” There’s no evidence that vaccines are currently unsafe.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t the first time Winfrey’s audience had been presented with the vaccines-autism theory. A few months before McCarthy’s appearance, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/us/18autism.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\">Katie Wright</a>, whose son has autism, said on the show, “The vaccine connection has not been refuted at all. In fact, we give 37 vaccines to babies under the age of 18 months. Nobody has shown that that’s safe, a wise idea, the multiple vaccines at once.”</p>\n<p>“She wanted to say it, and I wanted you to get it out there,” Winfrey replied, as the audience clapped. “Because you are a mother dealing with your child every day.”</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MP8nFGuGiM8?feature=oembed\" width=\"990\" height=\"743\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The following year, Christiane Northrup, a physician and one of Winfrey’s regular experts, <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/health/ask-dr-christiane-northrup\">answered a fan’s question</a> about the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/whatishpv.html\">human papillomavirus</a> vaccine, which protects against a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cervical cancer. Northrup expressed apprehension about the shot, saying she is “very concerned” about vaccinating young girls and would rather focus on a “getting everybody on a dietary program that would enhance their immunity,” according to a write-up on Winfrey’s website.</p>\n<p>“I’m a little against my own profession,” Northrup said. “My own profession feels that everyone should be vaccinated.” (A publicist for Northrup told <em>Mother Jones </em>that she was “unavailable for comment.”)</p>\n<p>Oprah’s show has since been criticized for promoting the careers of a number of <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/oprah-presidential-case-marred-by-promotion-dr-oz-jenny-mccarthy-others.html\">scientifically dubious guests</a> and offering unsound <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/why-health-advice-oprah-could-make-you-sick-80201\">health advice</a>. “Oprah is a really interesting figure, and she has clearly been a really positive force in so many ways,” says Seth Mnookin, director of MIT’s science writing program and author of <em>The Panic Virus</em>, which discusses anti-vaxxer appearances on Winfrey’s show. “I think public health is not one of those ways, and it’s not just around vaccines.”</p>\n<p>In a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/why-health-advice-oprah-could-make-you-sick-80201\">statement to <em>Newsweek</em></a><em>, </em>Winfrey defended the controversial medical advice offered by guests on her show, arguing that she was empowering viewers to make up their own minds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The guests we feature often share their first-person stories in an effort to inform the audience and put a human face on topics relevant to them. I’ve been saying for years that people are responsible for their actions and their own well-being. I believe my viewers understand the medical information presented on the show is just that—information—not an endorsement or prescription. Rather, my intention is for our viewers to take the information and engage in a dialogue with their medical practitioners about what may be right for them.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Winfrey’s own views on vaccinations aren’t clear. The Oprah Winfrey Network press office didn’t respond to requests for comment. An <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/health_wellness/vaccines-you-need-to-get-again/all#ixzz53ckVsbAI\">article</a> published last year on her website did encourage readers to get booster shots recommended by the CDC, including the MMR vaccine. “You may think you’ve had all the immunizations you’ll ever require,” the article said, “but the guidelines are constantly being fine-tuned—for the good of us all.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of her personal opinions, it’s evident that she offered anti-vaxxers an opportunity to voice their unfounded concerns on national TV and may not have considered the “long-term ramifications,” says Jennifer Reich, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Denver and the author of <em>Calling the Shots: Why Parents Reject Vaccines</em>. During the 2007 episode with McCarthy, for instance, Winfrey told viewers McCarthy would appear on a special online messaging board to answer questions, according to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=l_KwCOs3QhsC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=the+panic+virus+I%27m+so+proud+you+followed+your+mommy%C2%A0instinct&source=bl&ots=ayJW_4T705&sig=HmYYmxyklVsZwg7Zn1amkepkAHU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiC0aWz8svYAhXr7oMKHZeLBTEQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=the%20panic%20virus%20I%27m%20so%20proud%20you%20followed%20your%20mommy%C2%A0instinct&f=false\">Mnookin’s book</a>. On that board, McCarthy wrote, “If I had another child, I would not vaccinate.” When one mother wrote that she had chosen not to vaccinate her child because of the “autism link,” McCarthy replied, “I’m so proud you followed your mommy instinct.” </p>\n<aside>“They become vehicles to inject this misinformation into the nation’s consciousness.”</aside>\n<p>Still, it’s hard to say for sure how much influence celebrities have over decisions that parents make about vaccinating their children, according to Reich.“It’s not so much that someone is going to go into their pediatrician’s office for an appointment and say, ‘I saw this on Oprah, and I’m going to change what I do,'” she says. “It’s more that they become vehicles to inject this misinformation into the nation’s consciousness.”</p>\n<p>“They continue to raise the question that the science is somehow not settled,” adds Reich. “I think public health agencies are struggling with how to combat anecdotes. When a parent says this feels true to me, it’s really hard to stack that feeling against population data.”</p>\n<p>If Winfrey did decide to run for president, she’d hardly be the first candidate to have played a role in legitimizing inaccurate fears about vaccines. During the 2008 campaign, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/hillary-clinton-vaccine-tweet/\">Clinton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7963837/obama-vaccine-autism\">Obama, and John McCain</a> all suggested that vaccines might cause autism. (So did a 2004 <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/toxic-tipping-point/\"><em>Mother Jones </em>story</a>.) </p>\n<p>In 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/16/michele-bachmann/bachmann-hpv-vaccine-cause-mental-retardation/\">wrongly suggested</a> during a GOP presidential debate that the HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation. More recently, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky) said vaccines can cause “mental disorders” and are “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/rand-paul-vaccines-can-lead-mental-disorders-n298821\">an issue of freedom.</a>” In the midst of worries about a measles outbreak, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) suggested <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/chris-christie-vaccinations-114825\">parents should have a choice</a> of whether or not to vaccinate; he later backed off his remarks. </p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"550\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!</p>\n<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/449525268529815552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>For his part, Trump suggested vaccines were linked to autism during a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/ben-carson-donald-trump-republican-presidential-debate-vaccine-autism-science-government/405901/\">presidential debate</a> in late 2015, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/30/donald-trump-vaccines-policy/\">met with anti-vaxxers</a> in 2016, and reportedly asked vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr. to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-meet-with-proponent-of-debunked-tie-between-vaccines-and-autism/2017/01/10/4a5d03c0-d752-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.c316fad1f899\">lead a commission</a> on “vaccine safety” shortly before taking office. (No such commission <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/21/trump-vaccine-commission-robert-kennedy/\">has been created</a>.)</p>\n<p>Most Americans still support vaccinating children. A survey by <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/02/02/young-adults-more-likely-to-say-vaccinating-kids-should-be-a-parental-choice/\">the </a><a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/02/02/vast-majority-of-americans-say-benefits-of-childhood-vaccines-outweigh-risks/\">Pew Research Center</a>, published in February 2017, found 82 percent of US adults say healthy children should be required to get the MMR vaccine in order to attend school, while just 17 percent say parents should be able to decide not to vaccinate their kids. But even a small decline in the percentage of children who are vaccinated can have serious consequences for public health. Last year, Minnesota fought its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15577316/minnesota-measles-outbreak-explained\">largest measles outbreak in nearly three decades</a>.</p>\n<p><em>* This story has been revised.</em></p>",

        "content": "<p>Here’s some good news: a federal court in North Carolina has overturned the state’s recent gerrymandering of its congressional districts. <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=96828\">According to Nicholas Stephanopoulos,</a> this is a first. Courts have overturned state legislative maps before. And they’ve overturned congressional maps because they were <em>racial</em> gerrymanders. But this is the first time a federal court has ever overturned a congressional map because it was a <em>partisan</em> gerrymander. <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=96824\">Rick Hasen has more:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The majority opinion by Judge Wynn is an <strong>unqualified victory for the plaintiffs,</strong> finding multiple grounds (including equal protection, the First Amendment, and the Elections Clause) for ruling that North Carolina’s plan is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p><strong>The result is not a big surprise given what North Carolina did here.</strong> After its earlier redistricting was declared a racial gerrymander, it came up with a new plan using only political data that it described as a partisan gerrymander on its own terms. It did this as a defense against a future racial gerrymandering claim. As the court explained at page 16, NC “Representative Lewis said that he “propose[d] that [the Committee] draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats because [he] d[id] not believe it[ would be] possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 2 Democrats.” <strong>If there’s any case that could be a partisan gerrymander, it’s this one.</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court is already considering two partisan gerrymandering cases, one from Wisconsin and one from Maryland. No doubt NC will appeal this case to the Supreme Court, which is likely to hold it in light of the decision in those cases (it would be too late, absent extraordinary briefing, to set the case for argument this term). It likely will be sent back to this court to reconsider in light of what the Court does.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the unanimous opinion, Judge James Wynn writes that legislators never argued that their plan was designed to do <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/rucho-opinion.pdf\">anything other than favor Republicans:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Legislative Defendants also do not argue—and have never argued—that the 2016 Plan’s intentional disfavoring of supporters of non-Republican candidates advances any democratic, constitutional, or public interest. Nor could they. <strong>Neither the Supreme Court nor any lower court has recognized any such interest furthered by partisan gerrymandering</strong>—“the drawing of legislative district lines to subordinate adherents of one political party and entrench a rival party in power.” And, as further detailed below, <strong>partisan gerrymandering runs contrary to numerous fundamental democratic principles and individual rights enshrined in the Constitution.</strong></p>\n<p>Rather than seeking to advance any democratic or constitutional interest, the state legislator responsible for drawing the 2016 Plan said he drew the map to advantage Republican candidates because he <strong>“think[s] electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats.”</strong> But that is not a choice the Constitution allows legislative mapdrawers to make. Rather, “the core principle of [our] republican government [is] that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not only does this ruling come after a previous map was tossed out for racial gerrymandering, but it comes only 18 months after a court struck down North Carolina’s new voting laws too. The court gave the North Carolina legislature two weeks to produce a new map.</p>\n<p>I wonder what Chief Justice John Roberts thinks of all this? He was the deciding vote to gut the Voting Rights Act on the grounds that it wasn’t really needed anymore because we live in a more enlightened age.¹ The next day² Republican leaders in North Carolina announced their intention to enact new election laws. Over the next couple of years, North Carolina tried to enact a racial gerrymander of its legislative districts that was struck down; passed a voting law that was overturned because it was designed to <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/07/circuit-court-north-carolina-law-targeted-african-americans-surgical-precision/\">“target African Americans with almost surgical precision”</a>; passed a racial gerrymander of its congressional districts that was struck down; and then produced yet another gerrymandered map that tried to hide the original’s intent by favoring Republicans instead of whites.</p>\n<p>If North Carolina had still needed preclearance from the Justice Department for this stuff, it never would have seen the light of day. But as soon as preclearance was gone, racial targeting was instantly back on the menu. The same thing has happened in other states too. The big difference is that North Carolina’s Republicans are unusually stupid and never even bothered to hide what they were doing. Republicans in most other states at least made a pretense that race had nothing to do with their voting law changes.</p>\n<p>Roberts’ decision was basically an empirical one: he wrote that requiring preclearance <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/supreme-court-hands-gop-gift-2014/\">wasn’t unconstitutional per se,</a> but it did need to be based on <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/07/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-north-carolina/\">evidence that racial discrimination still existed.</a> Given what’s happened since, I wonder if he’s had second thoughts? After all, we don’t really have to rely on arguments over demographics and social science anymore. We just have to look at what’s actually happening now that Southern states are freed of most constraints. It’s not pretty.</p>\n<p>¹I want to note that this isn’t really snark. It’s a pretty fair summary of what Roberts wrote in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>.</p>\n<p>²Seriously. It was literally <em>the day after</em> the Supreme Court handed down its opinion. See p. 10 of <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/nc-4th.pdf\">the court decision</a> overturning North Carolina’s election law.</p>",

But the ruling is also notable because it deals with the very issue the US Supreme Court is currently wrestling with in two separate cases: whether extreme<strong> </strong>partisan gerrymandering can be found unconstitutional. </p>\n<p>The majority of a three-judge panel found that North Carolina’s congressional map, drawn in 2016 and which helped Republican candidates take<strong> </strong>10 of the state’s 13 seats in the House of Representatives that year with just 53 percent of the votes, infringed on voters’ constitutional rights. This decision comes after the state’s previous map was deemed illegal for being racially gerrymandered in 2016. </p>\n<p>This is the first time that a federal district court has struck down a congressional map for partisan gerrymandering. The nearly 200-page <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/CC_LWV_v_Rucho_MemorandumOpinion_01.09.18.pdf\">opinion</a> states that<strong> </strong>the map “violates the Equal Protection Clause because it reflects a successful, and unjustified, effort by the General Assembly to subordinate the interests of non-Republican voters and entrench Republican Representatives in power.” It also argues that the map<strong> </strong>violates the First Amendment by burdening free speech and free association rights of voters who do not support Republicans. Finally, the court found that the map violates the Constitution’s “grant of authority to ‘the People’ to elect their Representatives”—in other words, rather than choose their representatives, their representatives chose their voters.  </p>\n<p>The opinion furthermore<strong> </strong>highlighted the danger of a partisan gerrymander that entrenches one political party in power. “[A] legislature that is itself insulated by virtue of an invidious gerrymander can enact additional legislation to restrict voting rights and thereby further cement its unjustified control of the organs of both state and federal government,” the majority wrote.</p>\n<p>The state is now<strong> </strong>blocked from moving forward with the 2018 congressional elections using the current map, and and the court<strong> </strong>gave the legislature two weeks to create a remedial plan. Should the legislature fail to create a plan that the court deems constitutional in that time period, the court says it’s prepared to put in place a map drawn by someone it appoints. </p>\n<p>If North Carolina ultimately holds its 2018 elections under a redrawn map, that could <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/950867362982612992\">help</a> Democrats’ efforts to retake the House of Representatives in 2018. But Democrats can’t celebrate just yet. The Republicans who drew the map are likely to appeal to the Supreme Court, which<strong> </strong>may put the ruling on hold as it decides similar cases out of Wisconsin and Maryland, thus allowing the 2018 elections to proceed under the old map. </p>\n<p>As election law expert Rick Hasen <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=96824\">put it</a> Tuesday evening, “This is a huge win for the plaintiffs but with an uncertain future at the Supreme Court.”</p>",

So if there’s any shock to supply, unless the Saudis open up the spigots (if they can), the price will spike up. I don’t sense wide awareness of this.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That got me curious. Here’s what long-term oil prices look like <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=hrbA\">over the past 40 years:</a></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_wti_1977_20172.gif\" class=\"wp-image-544738\" height=\"495\"></figure>\n<p>There’s nothing that looks especially concerning in these numbers, but the basic oil-recession cycle is fairly simple: (a) economic expansion leads to higher demand for oil, (b) demand eventually bumps up against supply constraints, (c) oil prices spike, (d) leading to a recession. However, the Energy Information Administration seems to think supply will continue to keep up with demand <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global_oil.php\">over the next couple of years:</a></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_eia_oil_supply_demand_2013_2019.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-544741\" height=\"568\"></figure>\n<p>For the time being, it doesn’t look like oil will be a constraint on growth in the near future.

Here are some excerpts from <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/09/politics/trump-latest/index.html?sr=twCNN010918trump-latest0142PMStory\">CNN’s real-time coverage.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I think my positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with,”</strong> Trump said….Trump added if the group presents him with a plan he does not like he would support it anyway. “If they come to me with things I’m not in love with, I’m gonna do it. Because I respect them,” he said.</p>\n<p>….Rep. Bob Goodlatte says he will introduce a bill that “addresses the DACA concerns” tomorrow….adding that legislatures hoped to “do it in a bipartisan fashion and put our best foot forward.” “It will address DACA in a permanent way, not a temporary short-term thing. <strong>We are going to address the border enforcement and security and the wall,</strong>” he said.</p>\n<p>….Sen. Lindsey Graham, foreshadowing how he believes some conservatives will react to the DACA discussions unfolding on television, said he could “hear the drumbeat” on Fox News and that <strong>“right-wing radio and TV talk show hosts are going to beat the crap out of us.”</strong></p>\n<p>….President Trump told lawmakers he would provide political cover for them if they moved forward on comprehensive immigration reform….<strong>“I’ll take the heat. I don’t care. I don’t care. I’ll take all the heat you want to give me, and I’ll take the heat off both the Democrats and the Republicans.”</strong></p>\n<p>….Here’s how Trump hopes to see things move: “We’ll do DACA and we can certainly start comprehensive immigration reform the following afternoon. We will take an hour off and start. I do believe that. Once we get DACA done and it’s done properly with security and everything else, if it’s done properly, we have taken a big chunk of comprehensive out of the negotiations. <strong>I don’t think it’s going to be that complicated.</strong>“</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump has a childlike belief that nothing is very complicated, but in this case he could be right.

        "content": "<p>On Tuesday, a federal judge allowed a 35-year-old court settlement prohibiting the Republican National Committee from challenging the eligibility of voters at the polls to <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=96810\">expire</a>. The ruling, by District Court Judge Michael Vazquez of New Jersey, could allow the Republican Party to undertake <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/11/donald_trump_will_supercharge_voter_suppression_if_the_rnc_consent_decree.html\">new voter suppression efforts</a>, such as purging voting rolls and intimidating voters at the polls, under the guise of combating voter fraud. The case hinged on Democrats being able to prove a recent violation of the decree, which dated back to the early ’80s.</p>\n<p>I explained the origins and <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/did-sean-spicer-violate-a-court-order-barring-republicans-from-suppressing-votes/\">significance of the case</a> in a December story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 1981, during a campaign for governor in New Jersey, the Republican National Committee launched a “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriBerman/status/764478963280470016\">Ballot Security Task Force</a>” that sent sample ballots to voters in predominantly African American and Hispanic precincts. When 45,000 letters were returned as undeliverable, the RNC tried to remove the voters from the rolls. To challenge those voters if they showed up to cast a ballot, it hired off-duty cops to patrol polling sites in black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Newark and Trenton. The officers carried firearms and wore armbands reading “National Ballot Security Task Force,” and the RNC posted large signs at the polling places saying, “Warning: This area is being patrolled by the National Ballot Security Task Force. It is a crime to falsify a ballot or to violate election laws.”</p>\n<p>Republican Tom Kean Sr. defeated Democrat Jim Florio by 1,797 votes in the closest governor’s race in New Jersey history. (One of Kean’s top advisers, Roger Stone, later advised Donald Trump.) “There was no doubt in my mind enough people were intimidated not to show up at the polls,” Florio <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/armed-men-once-patrolled-polls-will-they-reappear-november/\">told WNYC</a>.</p>\n<p>After the election, the Democratic National Committee won a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/dnc-v-rnc-consent-decree\">court settlement</a> ordering the RNC to “refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities” anywhere in the country.</p>\n<p>Democrats argued that former Trump press secretary <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/did-sean-spicer-violate-a-court-order-barring-republicans-from-suppressing-votes/\">Sean Spicer</a> violated the consent decree and deposed him in December. In an <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/inside-donald-trumps-election-night-war-room\">interview with <em>GQ</em></a> published in November, Spicer said he visited the fifth floor of Trump Tower on Election Day, when he was communications director for the RNC. The fifth floor was where the Trump campaign ran poll-monitoring operations. Campaign workers were instructed to contact officials there if they witnessed any “voter fraud” across the country. There were clear signs on the doors instructing RNC staff to stay away from that floor in order to avoid violating the consent decree. “It was a sign you can’t miss,” one person present that night <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/10/sean-spicer-gq-magazine-story-fallout-244784\">told <em>Politico</em></a>. “It was pretty glaring.” </p>\n<p>“The Trump campaign made it abundantly clear prior to the election that it would be conducting ballot-security efforts,” DNC lawyer Angelo Genova wrote to the court. “And Exhibit A shows that a senior RNC official was at the nerve center of those efforts on Election Day.”</p>\n<p>Prior to the election, the DNC also claimed the RNC had <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-is-encouraging-intimidation-and-racial-profiling-at-the-polls/\">violated the consent decree</a> when the Trump campaign used its website to recruit “<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/lp/volunteer-to-be-a-trump-election-observer\">Trump Election Observer</a>[s]” to “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/donald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html?_r=0\">Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election.</a>” (The DNC <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/10-26-2016_DNC-Support.pdf\">argued in court</a> that the RNC was “supporting and enabling the efforts” of the Trump campaign.) On the same day, Trump told his supporters to monitor the polls for potential voter fraud. “The only way they can beat [us] in my opinion, and I mean this 100 percent, is if in certain sections of the state they cheat, okay?” Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/13/how-donald-trumps-bizarre-voter-watch-effort-could-get-the-gop-in-trouble/\">said in Pennsylvania</a> in August 2016. “So I hope you people could, sort of, not just vote on the 8th—could go around and look at other polling places and make sure it’s 100 percent fine.” He specifically called on law enforcement to check for “cheating” and said “we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching”—reminiscent of the RNC’s illegal conduct in New Jersey in 1981. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Judge Vazquez, an Obama appointee, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/11-05-2016_Order.pdf\">declined to extend the consent decree</a> before or after the election. “As far as what’s before this court, you’ve presented me with no evidence of actual voter suppression efforts on the day of the election, much less tying it to the RNC,” he told DNC attorneys recently. He concluded in a short <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/consent-order.pdf\">court order</a> on Tuesday, “The DNC did not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, a violation of the Consent Decree.”</p>\n<p>The consent decree had required Republicans to get court approval for any effort to question voters’ eligibility at the polls, which deterred the party from many “ballot security” activities. The lifting of the order gives Republicans a new opening to try to remove voters from the rolls and mount new challenges at the polls. This is particularly concerning to voting rights advocates at a time when Trump has falsely stated that millions of people voted illegally in the last election, and as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case on Wednesday that could <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/supreme-court-nvra-voter-registration/\">weaken the National Voter Registration Act of 1993,</a> allowing Republican-controlled states to make it harder to register to vote.</p>",

Republicans almost literally have no policy positions these days that are popular. Repealing Obamacare polled poorly. Their tax bill is widely detested. No one wants to touch Social Security or Medicare even in a symbolic vote.</p>\n<p>The only popular proposal on President Trump’s plate is his trillion-dollar infrastructure project, but Republicans in Congress aren’t interested. So that leaves two things: (a) immigration and (b) avoiding disaster. The weird thing is that a comprehensive immigration deal is actually possible. The Senate could pass one pretty easily, and if Trump then bragged that it was the greatest, toughest, most America-Firstest immigration plan ever, his base would support it and the House would probably pass it. You know, sort of a Nixon-goes-to-China thing. And it would give Republicans another big win going into the 2018 midterms.</p>\n<p>Would Democrats buy in? Beats me. But it probably doesn’t matter since there’s no one in the Republican Party these days likely to lead the charge. Marco Rubio won’t do it again. Mitch McConnell has little interest. Trump is clueless and can’t lead anything. So I guess keeping the government open and paying its bills is all we’re going to get this year.

The <em>Washington Examiner</em>‘s David Drucker <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-arpaio-running-for-senate-in-arizona/article/2645354\">reported</a> Tuesday that 85-year-old former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio—who lost his job to a Democrat in 2016, was convicted of contempt for refusing to comply with a court order instructing his department to stop racial profiling, and was pardoned last fall by President Donald Trump in part because of his advanced age—will join the Republican primary to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake.</p>\n<p>The Republican primary was already shaping up to be a bitter contest. The field includes former state Sen. Kelli Ward, an ER doctor <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/kelli-ward-john-mccain-agenda-21/\">who once held a public hearing</a> on the theory that the government was poisoning citizens via airplane exhaust, and will <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/11/07/martha-mcsally-announces-senate-run-flake-seat-us-house-colleagues/802548001/\">likely</a> include US Rep. Martha McSally. The winner will likely take on Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema this fall.</p>\n<p>Although Arpaio is exalted as an icon of law and order on the right, his two decades in power were defined by a pervasive lawlessness and authoritarian tendencies. Inmate jail deaths were common—the county was forced to pay tens of millions of dollars for wrongful death settlements during Arpaio’s tenure. When the <i>Phoenix New-Times</i> published a story documenting Arpaio’s personal wealth, the sheriff had the reporters arrested on a false charge. (The county was forced to pay a $3.75 million settlement.) Arpaio famously convened a cold-case posse to investigate President Barack Obama’s birth certificate.</p>\n<p>But Arpaio’s singular legacy was his mistreatment of Hispanic residents of Maricopa County. Ultimately it’s what brought him down. A 2011 Department of Justice investigation found that Arpaio’s office “engages in a a systemic disregard for basic constitutional protections.” As<em> Mother Jones</em> <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2011/12/most-unconstitutional-sheriff-america/\">reported</a> at the time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The report issued by the Justice Department says Arpaio’s office undertook “discriminatory policing practices” through racial profiling, including “unlawfully stop[ping], detain[ing] and arrest[ing] Latinos.” Perez also said that Arpaio’s office unlawfully retaliated against critics of the Maricopa County Sheriff’s office by arresting or suing them, and punished Latino jail inmates for being unable to speak English by denying them basic services. The report also describes the Sheriff’s Office as responding to reports of people with “dark skin” or people who “spoke Spanish” rather than people actually committing crimes, and says officials exchanged racist jokes over email. Detention officers in Maricopa jails are described in the report as referring to Latinos as “wetbacks” and “Mexican bitches.” The report says Arpaio’s office “implemented practices that treat Latinos as if they are all undocumented, regardless of whether a legitimate factual basis exists to suspect that a person is undocumented.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Arpaio was eventually ordered to halt his department’s racist practices. It was his refusal to do so that ultimately resulted in his conviction. Arpaio’s efforts to round up immigrants came at the expense of other law-enforcement duties. His office <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/us/sheriff-joe-arpaio-criticized-over-handling-of-sex-crimes-cases.html\">ignored</a> more than 400 sex crime cases during his tenure. Some of the victims were undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>With Flake’s retirement and the state trending toward toss-up territory—Hillary Clinton lost by 3.5 points in 2016—Arizona will be one of Democrats’ top opportunities to pick up a seat in the Senate this fall. Democrats would love another shot at Arpaio, who underperformed Trump by 16 points in Maricopa County (and underperformed Sen. John McCain by even more) and whose presence in public office has been a boon for Latino political organizing in the state.</p>",

Dukakis was fake, Clinton was fake, Gore was fake, Kerry was fake, and Hillary Clinton was fake. The only recent Democratic candidate who’s mostly escaped this is Barack Obama. Republicans ran their usual playbook (“empty suit,” can’t give a speech without a teleprompter, etc.) but it never stuck.</p>\n<p>But Republicans are never stereotyped this way. Ronald Reagan was probably the first real master of political symbolism, but he was never viewed as anything but entirely authentic. George Bush bought a ranch one year before he ran for president and promptly moved into a house in Dallas when he left office, but clearing brush at Crawford somehow became evidence of his regular guyness. And Donald Trump is routinely viewed as representing genuine working-class grievance despite the fact that he’s the fakest president in history. He’s changed his mind—sometimes more than once—on practically every issue anyone cares about. He plainly cares nothing about actual policy. His tweets are almost 100 percent about projecting a fake persona. He adopts absurd positions (Mexico will pay for the wall, it’s OK to say “Merry Christmas” again) that are such obvious pandering they almost make your teeth hurt.</p>\n<p>Trump, like most Republican presidents, <em>speaks</em> in a tough-guy style. Even if he’s changed his mind since yesterday’s breakfast, he talks loudly and insists that he’s “strong” on whatever issue he’s asked about. And that seems to be enough for most people, the press included. Conversely, Bill Clinton was all about Sister Souljah and feeling your pain and “triangulation.” Al Gore changed his position on abortion a decade before running for president in 2000, but that was nevertheless Exhibit 1 (out of dozens) in the case that he was just a big phony. John Kerry was “for it before he was against it” and spawned innumerable “Top Ten Flip-Flop” lists from campaign reporters. And Hillary Clinton, despite a progressive record extending back for decades, was always portrayed as too cautious and poll-driven to ever give a straight answer to anything.</p>\n<p>Apparently Kirsten Gillibrand is about to get the same treatment because she softened her position on gun control after Sandy Hook. Will the press go along? Is she the next fake, flip-flopping Democrat to run for president? We’ll see.</p>",

By mid-October, state departments of agriculture nationwide had received <a href=\"https://ipm.missouri.edu/IPCM/2017/10/final_report_dicamba_injured_soybean/\">2,708 complaints</a> from soybean farmers who claimed their fields had been damaged by wayward dicamba. Some 3.6 million acres had been affected, an unprecedented case of herbicides gone rogue. The Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee agriculture departments all temporarily restricted or banned dicamba (<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/12/this-is-how-badly-monsanto-wants-farmers-to-spray-its-problematic-herbicide/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/arkansas-moves-to-ban-monsantos-blockbuster-herbicide/\">more states</a> will do so in 2018), and farmers launched <a href=\"https://www.agweb.com/article/dicamba-lawsuits-mounting--naa-chris-bennett/\">at least four class-action suits</a> demanding restitution from dicamba-makers. The company at the center of the firestorm was Monsanto—which in October struck back with its own lawsuit, seeking to halt an Arkansas regulation that limits dicamba use.</p>\n<p>This spring, the dicamba wars will likely intensify. What gives? Back in 2016, the seed and pesticide giant rolled out soybeans genetically engineered to withstand not one but two herbicides: glyphosate, branded as Roundup, and dicamba. It was a blockbuster: By the summer of 2017, 20 million acres—nearly a quarter of US soybeans, and more than 6 percent of all US land devoted to crops—were covered with Monsanto’s novel soybeans.</p>\n<p>In October, company executives hailed the debut as a “<a href=\"https://monsanto.com/app/uploads/2017/10/MonsantoCo._Q4F17_Earnings_Presentation_2017.10.04.pdf\">tremendous success</a>” and told investors they hoped the product would conquer two-thirds of the US soybean crop. If Monsanto hits those growth targets, it will add up to $350 million in revenue within just two years.</p>\n<aside>Hit any crop with a fatal dose of the same poison year in and year out, and most plants will promptly die.</aside>\n<p>And investors can bank on precedent. Back in the late ’90s, Monsanto released corn and soybeans—the two crops that cover about half of US farmland—that had been genetically tweaked to tolerate Roundup. The pitch: Spray Monsanto’s wonder chemical and all those pesky weeds will vanish, leaving the genetically modified crops to flourish. By 1999, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/charts/58020/biotechcrops_d.html?v=42565\">more than half</a> of US soybean plantings were “Roundup Ready.” Ten years later, herbicide-resistant seeds had spread to 91 percent of soybean plantings and 68 percent of corn.</p>\n<p>There was just one big Darwinian problem. Hit any crop with a fatal dose of the same poison year in and year out, and most plants will promptly die. But a few genetic freaks will survive, passing the trait to offspring—<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/07/monsanto-superweeds-roundup/\">ultimately allowing resistance genes to proliferate</a>.</p>\n<p>Predictably, a plague of Roundup-resistant weeds swept through farm country, so in 2016 Monsanto introduced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, designed to fend off not just Roundup, but also dicamba, an older, more toxic herbicide. And scientists expect dicamba resistance to rise. But the more urgent problem is that unlike glyphosate, dicamba is volatile. That is, after it has been applied, it’s prone to convert into a gas and be carried on the wind to nearby fields. In addition to soybeans, vineyards, home gardens, and oak forests <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-11/documents/ppdc-dicamba-overview-update-nov-1-2017.pdf\">have been hit by dicamba drift</a>.</p>\n<aside>The damage was “too uniform to be explained by anything else,” a weed scientist says.</aside>\n<p>Monsanto, along with other companies, is selling a new, <a href=\"https://www.roundupreadyxtend.com/About/vaporgriptechnology/Pages/default.aspx\">supposedly low-volatility</a> dicamba formulation. It insists that any off-target damage is due to user error. But several independent weed scientists have disputed Monsanto’s assessment, arguing that volatility is a major driver of the problem. University of Missouri plant pathologist Kevin Bradley says his research shows that in the warm summer months, even a low-volatility dicamba formulation can remain in the air and float to an unintended target <a href=\"https://ipm.missouri.edu/IPCM/2017/8/Off-target_movement/\">as many as four days after application</a>. Aaron Hager, a University of Illinois weed scientist, says that in at least half the affected acres he observed in his state in 2017, the damage was “too uniform to be explained by anything else.”</p>\n<p>In early November, Environmental Protection Agency officials warned <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/business/soybeans-pesticide.html?_r=0\">in a meeting with herbicide-makers</a> that they could lose dicamba approval if their products continued to damage crops. And Bradley says growers might spray less dicamba in 2018 to avoid trouble with their neighbors. But on the flip side, more farmers may buy the double-resistant seeds, to protect themselves from dicamba. Indeed, Bentlage says, one seed dealer recently hit him with this pitch: “You might as well buy some dicamba seeds. You know your neighbor’s gonna spray it—you might as well buy it, too, to keep from getting damaged.” In other words: Nice little soybean crop you have there; be a shame if something bad happened to it.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>This<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trashed-inside-the-deadly-world-of-private-garbage-collection\"> story</a> was originally published by </em><a href=\"http://www.propublica.org\">ProPublica</a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Shortly before 5 a.m. on a recent November night, a garbage truck with a New York Yankees decal on the side sped through a red light on an empty street in the Bronx. The two workers aboard were running late. Before long, they would start getting calls from their boss. “Where are you on the route? Hurry up, it shouldn’t take this long.” Theirs was one of 133 garbage trucks owned by Action Carting, the largest waste company in New York City, which picks up the garbage and recycling from 16,700 businesses.</p>\n<p>Going 20 miles per hour above the city’s 25 mph limit, the Action truck ran another red light with a worker, called a “helper,” hanging off the back. Just a few miles away the week before, another man had died in the middle of the night beneath the wheels of another company’s garbage truck. The Action truck began driving on the wrong side of the road in preparation for the next stop. The workers were racing to pick up as much garbage as possible before dawn arrived and the streets filled with slow traffic. “This route should take you twelve hours,” the boss often told them. “It shouldn’t take you fourteen hours.”</p>\n<p>Working 10- to 14-hour days, six days per week, means that no one is ever anything close to rested. The company holds monthly safety meetings and plays videos, taken by cameras installed inside the trucks, of Action drivers falling asleep at the wheel. “You’re showing us videos of guys being fatigued, guys falling asleep,” a driver told me. (All Action employees asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation.) “But you aren’t doing anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“In the history of the company I am sure there have been times where supervisors have inappropriately rushed people,” said Action Carting CEO Ron Bergamini. “They shouldn’t be, and they’d be fired if they ever told people to run red lights or speed. But you have to find the balance between efficiency and safety, and that’s a struggle we work on every day. But you cannot turn around and say, ‘Hey just take your time, go as long as you want.’” He pointed out that workers can anonymously report concerns to a safety hotline. As to the questions of overwork and driver fatigue, Bergamini responded, “That’s a struggle that the whole industry has—of getting people to work less.”</p>\n<p>In the universe of New York’s garbage industry, Action is considered a company that takes the high road. A union shop, it offers starting pay of about $16 per hour for helpers and $23 for drivers, far more than many other companies. And unlike some other companies, Action provides high-visibility gear and conducts safety meetings. But since 2008, the company’s trucks have killed five pedestrians or cyclists.</p>\n<p>In New York City overall, private sanitation trucks killed seven people in 2017. By contrast, city municipal sanitation trucks haven’t caused a fatality since 2014.</p>\n<aside>“You’re showing us videos of guys being fatigued, guys falling asleep,” a driver said, “but you aren’t doing anything about it.”</aside>\n<p>Pedestrians aren’t the only casualties, and Action isn’t the only company involved in fatalities. Waste and recycling work is the fifth most fatal job in America—far more deadly than serving as a police officer or a firefighter. Loggers have the highest fatality rate, followed by fishing workers, aircraft pilots and roofers. From the collection out on garbage trucks, to the processing at transfer stations and recycling centers, to the dumping at landfills, the waste industry averages about one worker fatality a week. Nationally, in 2016, 82 percent of waste-worker deaths occurred in the private sector.</p>\n<p>There are two vastly different worlds of garbage in New York City: day and night. By day, 7,200 uniformed municipal workers from the city’s Department of Sanitation go door-to-door, collecting the residential trash. Like postal workers, they tend to follow compact routes. They work eight-hour days with time-and-a-half for overtime and snow removal and double-time for Sundays. With a median base pay of $69,000 plus health care, a pension, almost four weeks of paid vacation and unlimited sick days, the Department of Sanitation workforce is overwhelmingly full time and unionized. It’s also 55 percent white, and 91 percent male.</p>\n<p>But come nightfall, an army of private garbage trucks from more than 250 sanitation companies zigzag across town in ad hoc fashion, carting away the trash and recycling from every business—every bodega, restaurant and office building in the five boroughs. Those private carters remove more than half of the city’s total waste.</p>\n<p>Since each business chooses its own carter, a dozen garbage trucks might converge on a single block over the course of a night. In one five-block stretch near Rockefeller Center, for example, 27 garbage companies stop at 86 businesses, according to an analysis of city data by ProPublica and the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute. Plenty of other U.S. cities split trash collection along the same lines—residential waste on the municipal side, commercial waste on the private side—but New York is singular in the scale of private collection operations.</p>\n<p>Many waste companies pay workers a flat fee, some as little as $80 a shift, no matter the hours, with no health benefits, overtime pay or retirement plans. The practice of employing helpers off the books is widespread, according to a 2016 report by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration. The workforce is more than 60 percent minority, and more than half of Latino workers and about a third of black workers earn less than $35,000 annually. Many of these jobs are non-union, and while the drivers tend to be full-time employees, the helpers are often contract workers with unstable hours — some scrambling to work enough to feed their families, others clocking 18-hour or longer days. A May 2016 study by the nonprofit New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health found that the underpayment or nonpayment of wages is “rampant in the commercial waste industry.”</p>\n<p>Five Star Carting, the third biggest garbage company in New York City, with 10,400 customers, has received numerous citations from the New York State Department of Labor for underpayment or nonpayment of wages. In 2015, after two Five Star workers testified at a City Council hearing about their long hours, low pay and unsafe work conditions, they were fired. (They were later reinstated but only after labor advocates and City Council members organized a rally outside of Five Star’s headquarters.) Five Star declined to respond to detailed questions.</p>\n<p>Private garbage trucks are ubiquitous on New York’s streets after dark, yet the human effort involved remains largely invisible to most people. To travel deep into the world of New York’s midnight trash collection is to enter a realm where people often toil in grave danger for low pay. Those perils are easy to miss in the roar of a diesel engine, the rush of a giant truck and a waft of scent from a bag we’re all happy to see somebody else remove.</p>\n<p>My first night following a garbage truck was on a sweltering Thursday in July 2016. After many rejections, I had persuaded a driver to let me follow him for a shift. He was taking a big chance: Workers can get fired in an instant, but he was willing to risk his job to take me into his world. What I saw opened the door to a far more complex investigation than I’d anticipated, one that involved dozens of interviews over 18 months with drivers, helpers, regulators, owners and experts; combing through thousands of pages of civil and criminal records; reviewing hundreds of documents obtained through public-records requests; and building a database of federal truck inspection records.</p>\n<p>That night in 2016, Alex Caban prepared for his shift as a garbage truck driver at #1 Waste and Recycler. New York was then in the middle of the city’s longest heat wave in 14 years. In his apartment above a deli in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Caban dressed quickly in a black T-shirt, black Dickies and black leather work boots. Hot trash and its many leaky juices will soil anything lighter. Caban, a garbage man of three years, does not like to look dirty.</p>\n<p>Caban snacked on banana chips while he drove his minivan to the company yard, a gravel lot on an industrial stretch of Pacific Street in Brooklyn where freight trucks, buses and pit bulls are kept behind chain link fences. He prefers to drive to and from work so that when he heads home at the end of his shift soaked in what workers call “garbage juice,” he is not the person in the subway car that other riders move away from. “They think you’re a bum,” Caban explained, wrinkling his face for effect. An animated 45-year-old, Caban spoke in a Puerto Rican staccato, one thought tumbling excitedly into the next. He looked a decade younger with his wire-rimmed glasses, shaved head, and—when he wasn’t working—a button-down shirt and a brimmed hat.</p>\n<p>Caban arrived at the yard. Awaiting him was Bilal, 18, an immigrant from Yemen (he asked to be identified only by his first name). A “helper,” Bilal would spend much of the night riding the back “stepper” of Caban’s aging green garbage truck. Several lights were smashed in the rear, and the driver’s side door hung crookedly behind the cab, offering a view inside of ripped seats. Faded lettering on the side recorded the truck’s past lives. (“UNDER CONTRACT TOWN OF ISLIP”) showed it had once hauled trash in a Long Island town. (“PUT YOUR CANS IN OUR HANDS”) pointed to time in the recycling business.</p>\n<p>Caban hoped for the same things that every garbage worker hopes for at the start of each shift. No crashes. No injuries. No fires in the hopper. No truck breakdowns. In Caban’s five weeks of driving for #1 Waste, something was always breaking down. One night it was the transmission, he said, another the radiator, another the compactor. Twice the brakes failed, he said — this on a 10-wheeled vehicle that weighs about 40,000 pounds without a load of garbage and more than 80,000 pounds with. Making it home alive each night was a small victory. (#1 Waste and Recycler did not respond to a detailed list of questions.)</p>\n<aside>Rushing makes the job more dangerous, and most everyone has to rush in order to finish hundreds of stops—sometimes more than 1,000—in a night.</aside>\n<p>It was shortly after 6 p.m. on a night that could last past eight in the morning. Caban stepped up through the opening where the driver’s side door should have been. His helper, Bilal, rode shotgun. The engine growled, the throttle shaking the truck’s body, and with a blast of black exhaust, Caban pulled out and took a right on Classon Avenue, the broken driver’s side door flopping in the breeze.</p>\n<p>Rushing makes the job more dangerous, and most everyone has to rush in order to finish hundreds of stops—sometimes more than 1,000—in a night, covering a route that could easily be 85 miles. As most any private sanitation worker in New York City will tell you, the routes are often too long to finish within the 11-hour driving limit set by federal Department of Transportation regulations. As a result, many garbage truck drivers routinely drive far more than the 11-hour limit, hardly getting any time to rest before they must return to the wheel.</p>\n<p>After working a double shift in August 2016 that lasted nearly 23 hours, Queens County Carting driver William Bonds was fired after refusing to work another double shift less than two days later. On the first shift, Bonds had fallen asleep at the wheel. He was worried he might kill someone. (Queens County Carting owner Michael Bilik acknowledged in an unemployment hearing that Bonds routinely worked 60 to 80 hours a week, and his dispatcher explained that daytime drivers sometimes worked doubles when the company was short nighttime drivers. An administrative law judge found that Bonds “had good reason for refusing overtime that day…feeling exhausted and incapable of driving the truck.” Bonds is now a plaintiff in a negligence lawsuit against the company.)</p>\n<p>It doesn’t help that many rigs are in terrible condition. Garbage trucks from New York City’s 50 biggest companies are pulled off the road and declared unsafe to drive after 53 percent of government inspections, according to an analysis of data from the city and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Fourteen of those 50 companies hadn’t been inspected even once in the past two years. Nationally, commercial trucks are pulled off the road after 21 percent of inspections.</p>\n<p>The industry doesn’t display a lot of urgency on safety issues. In October, garbage company owners, lobbyists and city officials held an event billed as a Safety Symposium, where industry participants seemed more eager to blame cyclists than take responsibility. “We’ve been talking about as an industry what we’ve been doing,” said Bill Falletta, safety manager of Action Carting, whose truck killed 27-year-old cyclist Neftaly Ramirez in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn on July 22. “Is there anything being done to educate the bicyclists on safety? They should be following the same traffic rules that we do. I very rarely see that.” Later, when a city official explained that—although it was perhaps counterintuitive—narrower streets are actually safer because they slow the flow of traffic, David Biderman, an industry lobbyist, raised his hand and asked if narrower bike lanes could be used to slow down bicyclists. The consensus seemed to be that two-wheeled transportation was the real menace on the road.</p>\n<p>Said City Council member Antonio Reynoso at a Nov. 27 hearing on safety in the industry: “I thought by now that we would have seen more change, and we haven’t.”</p>\n<p>In real life, the need to move fast trumps traffic rules as often as not. On the July night I spent following Caban’s truck, it barreled past restaurant supply stores of Atlantic Avenue, made a right on Franklin Avenue, a left on Dean Street and another left on Kingston Avenue. Along the way, Caban and Bilal, his helper, sent bags sailing through the air from the curb into the street and from the street up into the truck’s back hopper. From Broccoli Farm to Superior Market, from Subway to Fulton Gourmet Deli, Caban made his way down the 500 stops on his route sheet, leaving a plume of hot garbage odor in the truck’s wake. Delis, liquor stores, laundromats, grocery stores, pharmacies, pizzerias, restaurants—Caban’s stops went from Crown Heights to Fort Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick in Brooklyn, and then to the Lower East Side, Midtown, the Upper East Side, Harlem, East Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Setting up, as it’s called, is the foundation of successful—which is to say fast—driver-helper teamwork, and it requires both driver and helper to memorize the entire route sheet. The drill worked like this: Bilal jumped off the back stepper, raced ahead to a stop, and began to toss or drag garbage bags from the curb to the street. Caban, meanwhile, parked the truck to align its back hopper with the garbage and ran around back in time to help heave the bags from the street into the hopper.</p>\n<p>If a helper is skilled, like Bilal, and if there are multiple stops on a single stretch, he won’t wait for the driver but run ahead and continue setting up stops along the route. Tonight, Caban would often drive further ahead, get the stops with lighter bags himself and then circle back to get the set-up garbage. And if a helper is really, really fast, by the time Caban drives back the helper will have returned to where he started, and together the two can quickly make their way down the set-up stops.</p>\n<p>Helpers change from night to night, and having a good helper is the difference between Caban working 10 hours and 15. In Caban’s estimation, Bilal is “the number one helper” at #1 Waste. “He dazzles me every time,” said Caban. Bilal knows the art of the set-up and he knows the route; he knows when and where to sprint ahead.</p>\n<p>Theirs was a carefully choreographed routine, their faces set and focused, every motion swift and economical to shave off the seconds and the minutes. At a stop on Verona Place, Bilal threw bags over a parked silver Jeep, Caban catching one in mid-air and tossing it in the hopper, like a perfectly executed assist. At the Kennedy Fried Chicken on Marcus Garvey Boulevard, Bilal hopped off the back of the moving garbage truck, sprinted ahead to the curb, motioned back-up directions to Caban with a few quick flicks of the wrist. Caban then jumped out to get the bags while Bilal sprinted through traffic to the next stop. Caban then ran back into the truck and drove diagonally across the intersection to meet him. Repeat. “It’s a beautiful thing,” Caban said, and it was.</p>\n<p>Baby-faced, with a ready grin, Bilal looked young for his 18 years and barely weighed more than some of the bags he was lifting. He wore a blue and white striped polo shirt, and neither he nor Caban wore reflective vests—they said #1 Waste hadn’t provided any safety equipment. Workers say that’s common in the industry. Caban and Bilal purchased their own thin black cloth work gloves with traction on the fingers (about $15 for a pack of three, which might last a week or two). Cloth won’t protect against the glass that often protrudes through the garbage bags, but nobody wears thick leather safety gloves. The grip is bad and slows you down; you’re liable to lose your hold on the slick plastic bags and punch yourself in the face.</p>\n<p>Private carting companies have been part of the fabric of New York since the early 1900s. The carters handled trash in commercial areas, and municipal sanitation workers picked up the trash everywhere else, residential and business alike. That changed in 1957 when the city decided that commercial trash was too much trouble. Suddenly, all businesses had to pay for their trash collection. The Mafia quickly carved the city into territories. Under what was called the property-rights system, each stop was “owned” by a specified hauler. Attempting to underbid another carter was considered to be “stealing” his customer. Garbage haulers colluded, submitting uniformly high price estimates to a customer. Then the stop’s owner would offer a slightly lower estimate to win the contract—a practice better known as bid-rigging.</p>\n<aside>“It was an open secret for four decades that the mob was in control of the commercial carting industry.”</aside>\n<p>Controlled primarily by the Gambino and Genovese crime families, four trade waste associations enforced the property-rights system—the cartel—using extortion, threats and violence. Favored tactics involved baseball bats, firebombing garbage trucks and the occasional murder. When Browning-Ferris Industries, a major national waste company, tried to enter the market in 1993, an executive found the severed head of a dog on his doorstep one morning. A note was stuffed into its mouth: “Welcome to New York.”</p>\n<p>“It was an open secret for four decades that the mob was in control of the commercial carting industry,” explained Daniel Castleman, former head of investigations in Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau’s office. Castleman was a script advisor for “The Sopranos” and even played the federal prosecutor who tried to take down Junior Soprano. The show’s fictional universe was very much representative of reality, Castleman said. “There’s a reason that Tony Soprano was in the carting industry.”</p>\n<p>In the early 1990s, Morgenthau’s office launched an undercover investigation of the industry. An NYPD agent posed as “cousin Danny” in a Brooklyn carting company, another posed as a building manager, and another as a Browning-Ferris Industries employee. Secret recordings confirmed the existence of the property-rights system and its control by mob members. The first of many rounds of indictments came down in 1995, and ultimately 72 defendants were charged: carting companies, owners, trade waste association leaders, the trade waste associations themselves, and the capos and soldiers they reported to.</p>\n<p>In 1996, the city passed Local Law 42, aimed at cracking the cartel, and created the licensing agency that is now known as the Business Integrity Commission to root out organized crime. The waste industry fought the reforms, but its suit against Local Law 42 was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The prosecutions brought down the cartel. Many leaders went to jail, had their assets seized and agreed to a lifetime ban, called a debarment, from the industry. Others were never prosecuted but still signed debarment agreements. Some people on BIC’s debarment list moved their companies out of town or sold them.</p>\n<p>But many on the debarment list simply handed their companies over to their wives or sons, who continued in the industry. Being related to someone on the debarment list is not grounds for the denial of a BIC license. (Haulers must be of “good character, honesty, and integrity.”) More than one person told me the sins of the father should not be imputed to the son … but you might want to want to take a close look at anyone related to past cartel members.</p>\n<p>To get a flavor of the sometimes dizzying ways in which families and entities intertwined, consider the Toscano family and its waste operations. In 1975, a company called TNT Carting was one of 55 haulers in New York that pleaded guilty to restraint of trade. TNT’s officers included Thomas J. Toscano and his brother Nicholas. Later Thomas J. Toscano founded Mr. T Carting. A nonagenarian, today he fills a more ceremonial role in the company (currently the fifth-largest hauler in New York), while his grandson Thomas N. Toscano is the company’s CFO.</p>\n<p>For their parts, Nicholas Toscano and several other family members were debarred from the industry. They had started a spin-off company in the 1980s called Mr. N Carting on <a href=\"https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentImageView?doc_id=FT_3520001370852\">land</a> purchased by a realty corporation based at the <a href=\"https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentImageView?doc_id=FT_3510001370851\">same address</a> as Mr. T Carting. (“The companies were completely separate. It was strictly a tenant-landlord relationship,” explained Thomas N. Toscano. “There’s an old saying, ‘You can’t pick your family.’ So, you know, we had nothing to do with them.”)</p>\n<p>For all the upheaval, many cartel-era companies survived the transition. For example, Liberty Ashes, Mr. T Carting and New Style Waste Removal Corp (now Boro-Wide Recycling) were all members of the trade waste associations in the days of the cartel, according to lists recovered from the associations’ offices during the execution of search warrants in 1995. “You couldn’t do business in this industry without being members of those associations,” explained Thomas N. Toscano. “Yes, we were members. Yes, we paid dues. And the only time they ever went there was every three years when the union negotiation came up.” The Brooklyn association pleaded guilty to criminal restraint of trade in 1997, and the Queens association pleaded guilty to a criminal antitrust violation in 1998.</p>\n<p>Lupe Todd-Medina, a spokesperson for New Yorkers for Responsible Waste Management, an industry group, responded to questions sent to multiple companies, including Liberty Ashes, New Style Recycling, Viking Sanitation and Boro-Wide Recycling. Todd-Medina did not address the detailed questions regarding the individual companies, but did provide a general statement: “The companies addressed in your story are all privately-held businesses—many of which are multi-generational,” she wrote. “For more than twenty years, the city’s Business Integrity Commission regulates [sic] the industry’s operations, and granted licenses to these companies following an intensive review process that independent observers agree has restored the industry’s competitiveness and high level of service to its customers.”</p>\n<p>Still, the industry has its fair share of eyebrow-raising episodes. In late 2012, the BIC <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/downloads/pdf/denials/final_conclusion_%20investigation_of_frank_coppola_%20by_bic_11-20-14.pdf\">told Mr. T Carting</a> that it couldn’t hire a convicted drug trafficker with ties to the Gambino and Lucchese crime families as a sales representative. Thomas N. Toscano, the CFO of Mr. T Carting, then <a href=\"http://trashkingpinsnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mr-T-Carting-and-Coppola-v.-Shari-Hyman-Complaint.pdf\">sued</a> the BIC in an attempt to keep the employee, which proved unsuccessful. (“They literally put the poor guy on ice after he had quit his other job,” said Toscano of the employee, who the BIC had previously approved to work for another carting company.)</p>\n<p>In August 2016, the de Blasio administration released a study that recommended reining in the chaos of New York’s waste and recycling industry by dividing the city into zones. A company would make a bid to collect the garbage from all of the businesses in a given zone, and the city would pick the winner. According to the study, which was done by the Department of Sanitation and the BIC, zoning could reduce truck traffic by up to 68 percent and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 64 percent, leading to “cleaner air” and “safer streets,” as well as improve recycling rates, customer service and worker safety. A handful of cities, including Seattle, San Jose and Los Angeles, have introduced zoning. The efforts in Seattle and San Jose have yielded improved recycling rates and higher wages; the changes in Los Angeles are still being implemented.</p>\n<p>Past city administrations have periodically attempted to adopt zoned waste collection, but industry resistance proved insurmountable. Today, again, zoning has the support of the de Blasio administration but legislation has yet to be introduced in the City Council—and the industry is still resisting. In 2016, the haulers launched NYRWM, which has spent $298,000 lobbying city officials. In her statement, Todd-Medina blasted zoning as “an arbitrary system,” arguing that it would “eliminate customer choice, decrease industry employment, and increase costs to businesses…” On the NYRWM website, prospective members are invited to contact the group’s general counsel/secretary-treasurer, a lawyer named Ray Shain who was disbarred from practicing law in New York in 2003 after pleading guilty to a criminal bid-rigging, bribery and kickback scheme that defrauded Queens public schools out of an estimated $6.3 million. (“Ray Shain is engaged as counsel to NYRWM, and provides administrative support for its operations,” said Todd-Medina in her written statement. She pointed out that he was re-instated to the bar several years ago and “does not own or operate a waste services business.”)</p>\n<p>Industry opposition notwithstanding, the de Blasio administration is pressing forward with its reform efforts. The Department of Sanitation has hired consultants who are developing a proposal for what zoning might look like in New York. The exact number of zones is to be determined—Los Angeles has 11, for example—but only one company would operate in each. That suggests most of the city’s 250 private carters would have no chance at winning a bid. Even as it stands, the smaller companies tend not to last long; bigger companies snap them up. The 20 biggest companies in New York currently generate 80 percent of the revenue, according to the 2016 study, with the other roughly 200 operators fighting over the rest.</p>\n<p>In Caban’s view, the old days were the golden era of garbage. If a man worked himself to the bone, he could earn enough to buy a house and a car and send a kid to college. Working the night shift at a garbage company in New York basically had all the perks of working the day shift at the Sanitation Department. Almost every garbage company in the city was in the same union, Teamsters Local 813, and every three years, the union would rent out the ballroom at the Sheraton Hotel so garbage men could ratify the contract, which achieved routine raises, triple-time pay for snow duty, as well as paid holidays, vacations and a pension.</p>\n<p>That changed after the sweeping prosecutions of the 1990s. The gates were opened for a flood of non-union companies, and citywide collective bargaining became a thing of the past. “They got the mob out. But the workers got screwed royally,” said Teamsters organizer Allan Henry.</p>\n<p>Powerful AFL-CIO-affiliated unions like the Laborers and the Teamsters were edged out of private garbage operators. They were replaced by “independent unions” that cut sweetheart deals with employers, locking employees into jobs with low wages and poor benefits. One example is a union called LIFE 890, which represents workers at major New York City garbage companies including Boro-Wide Recycling, Liberty Ashes and Five Star Carting.</p>\n<p>A man named John N. Mongello runs the union and its health care benefit plan out of a residential townhouse in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that he and his wife Kathy purchased in 1988. In 2016, LIFE’s benefit plan paid John Mongello $199,000 and his daughter Jessica Mongello Gambino took home $103,000. The union pays an LLC owned by Kathy $90,000 per year in rent, and the whole family—his wife, two daughters and a son—has been on the payroll in various capacities, off and on, since 2000. Filings with the Department of Labor show that administrative expenses have consumed as much as 45 percent of the health care fund’s expenses. Mongello was indicted in 1978, when he was president of a different union, on federal charges of conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of labor hearings. In 1985, he resolved the case, pleading guilty to making false claims; he was sentenced to 360 months’ probation and a small fine. (LIFE 890 and John Mongello did not respond to a detailed list of questions.)</p>\n<p>Workers at several LIFE 890 shops, meanwhile, have said they’ve either never heard of the union or rarely see its representatives. And to the extent that the union plays a role, it hardly seems like a champion for its workers’ wages. At Liberty Ashes, the LIFE 890 contract sets starting pay at $0.25 per hour above minimum wage in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>Perhaps as a result of such stances, companies seem more enthusiastic about LIFE 890 than workers do. When LIFE 890 attempted to replace the Teamsters as the union at Planet Waste last year, company owner Tom Tolentino told the Daily News he favored LIFE 890, claiming the Teamsters pension plan could bankrupt the company. The workers then voted to join LIFE 890. (Tolentino declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>In a wage-related class action lawsuit filed against Five Star in 2014, LIFE’s representative submitted an affidavit that supported the company rather than the workers the union ostensibly represents. “Nino [Tristani] is very quick to respond to my emails and address the grievances,” the union rep said of Five Star’s cofounder, “and is open to discussing the best way to resolve the issue.” Five Star settled with 61 workers in 2016 for $400,000 without admitting liability; LIFE 890 members were excluded from the settlement because the union’s contract mandates arbitration for grievances.</p>\n<p>LIFE 890’s role is at issue in a current suit in Manhattan federal court, in which former Liberty Ashes workers are suing over unpaid overtime wages. The company argues that the plaintiffs lack legal standing to bring the case on the grounds that all pay disputes must be addressed in arbitration proceedings. As it happens, LIFE 890 added a mandatory arbitration clause to the Liberty Ashes contract in December 2016—just weeks before the company submitted it as evidence—which lawyers for Liberty Ashes maintain should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p>A federal judge expressed skepticism about that position. “It seems to me at least counterintuitive that an employer and current employees through their union would be able to negotiate away rights of former employees,” said the judge, Richard Sullivan, in a hearing in February 2017.</p>\n<p>When I described LIFE 890 to Ronald Goldstock, the former director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, he emailed me a law review article on labor racketeering, defined as “the use of union power for personal benefit.” Goldstock said, “This is right out of the playbook. I think a DA’s office would be very interested.”</p>\n<p>Independent unions have helped lower wages across the industry. In 1985, a helper started out making $16 an hour. At #1 Waste in 2016, Caban—a driver—made less.</p>\n<p>The sun hadn’t even set, and Caban was already tired. On Sunday and Monday, Caban had a helper who didn’t know the route, so they were on the road for 14 1/2-hours each shift and didn’t finish up until 8:30 a.m. Six days a week on the nightshift made it hard for anybody to ever get enough sleep. Caban usually woke in the afternoon, and before long it was time to head back to the yard. On Saturday, his one day off, his body ached and he was too exhausted to leave his apartment. Days passed where Caban hardly talked to anyone outside of work.</p>\n<p>Caban raced down Marcy, west on DeKalb, and north on Bedford, following a circuitous route and running more red lights than one could count. As the hopper filled with bags spurting garbage juice, Bilal pulled a lever on the right side to “run a cycle,” bringing the blade down to grab the bags. Then he pulled it again to “send it up,” packing the garbage into the truck’s body.</p>\n<aside>Wrestling a container into the back of a garbage truck is a precarious maneuver, and it can easily slip and fall on you.</aside>\n<p>If there was one thing Caban was grateful for each night, it was that his route involved only garbage bags—no containers (what laypeople call dumpsters). When he had worked with containers at previous jobs at Viking Sanitation and La Vega Carting, he faced the constant fear of being crushed. Wrestling a container into the back of a garbage truck is a precarious maneuver, and it can easily slip and fall on you—a common way to die or lose a limb in this industry, according to the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>\n<p>After three years on the job, Caban was marked from head to toe. He had a deep scar on his left leg (stitches after glass in a bag sliced open his calf). On his right leg, there was crosshatching below his kneecap (more glass), and below that another scar from the time he missed when jumping onto the back of a Viking Sanitation garbage truck as it hurriedly pulled away (a jump he might have landed had he not been so exhausted at 5 a.m.). Then there was the deep indent on the left side of his head “about four inches behind what used to be my hairline,” Caban explained: A winch once slipped off a Viking container and smashed open his skull. Perhaps the most gruesome injury was from November 2013, when another Viking worker moved a container at just the wrong moment, crushing his hand. That night, he lost the tip of his right index finger.</p>\n<p>That severed finger was how I originally found Caban. I was tracking down injuries in New York City’s waste industry through contacts from a Teamsters local. Caban entered my notes as “severed finger #5.”</p>\n<p>Missing finger #1 was Sidney Marthone, a former Five Star Carting worker. He severed his left middle finger while emptying a broken container. “If you make a complaint about safety, they just stop calling you to come and do work,” said Marthone, a young Haitian immigrant. (A spokesperson for Five Star Carting declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>After Marthone, I found three men who’d worked at Liberty Ashes who each lost a finger on the same garbage truck—Truck 11—according to a review of workers compensation records and interviews with five workers. Several workers said the company had removed a safety latch in the back that would have locked in the container while it was being emptied. Liberty’s containers were too big to fit the latch, the workers said, so the company took it off instead of spending the money to buy new containers. The three amputations occurred between 2010 and 2016: First, Lenny Menna, a driver, severed a pinkie. Then came Luis Acevedo, a helper, who also severed a pinkie. A third worker lost his ring finger in early 2016. (Michael Bellino, Jr. of Liberty Ashes said, “I’m well aware of incidents that have happened with my company.”) Menna and Acevedo are plaintiffs in the wage and hours suit against the company.</p>\n<p>No New York City agency is directly responsible for waste worker health and safety. Instead, it’s a regulatory patchwork: The city’s Department of Sanitation oversees what’s done with the waste itself, the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation oversees the waste transfer stations, the state’s Department of Transportation inspects the trucks, and the city’s Business Integrity Commission handles licensing and background checks to determine that a company isn’t mobbed up.</p>\n<p>That leaves the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a federal agency with 67 inspectors for millions of workers in the state of New York, to look after the wellbeing of the workers. Waste companies “routinely violate OSHA requirements,” according to the 2016 study by the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health. Removal of a safety latch is the kind of thing that would probably warrant an OSHA citation, but Liberty, according to OSHA’s database, has never received one; what’s more, the company has never been inspected, according to several FOIA requests of OSHA. (Todd-Medina, speaking on behalf of Liberty Ashes, declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>A missing safety latch can claim more than a finger. In 2014, a helper at Flag Container Services on Staten Island was crushed to death after a container slipped. His truck had no safety latch. OSHA fined the company $7,000, the maximum allowable by law.</p>\n<p>Drivers devise inventive ways to make do with broken equipment and run-down garbage trucks. As Rodney Miles, a former driver at Five Star, put it, “You’ve got to know the distance.” Which meant: the length it took for his truck to come to a rolling halt. On his truck, moving below 25 miles an hour, he estimated the distance was the length of five cars. “If you were going down a hill with no load on it, you stand a better chance of stopping,” he said. “But if you have a load, then forget about it.” Twice, Miles said, unable to stop suddenly, he crashed into other vehicles. Another night, a wheel of his garbage truck came rolling off while he was driving on Canal Street in Staten Island. On a different night, both the brakes and the steering failed. “God was with me that night. I avoided death and killing somebody else,” Miles recalled. (Trucks from Five Star Carting are pulled off the road for being unsafe after 69 percent of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspections. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>Workers at companies large and small told similar stories. At Queens County Carting, Ernesto Waight said he drove one truck where the shifter would suddenly jump into reverse, and another where a wheel rolled off on Astoria Boulevard in Queens. After Wilson Perez’s brakes failed exiting the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, he said, a supervisor told him to drive the truck back to the yard regardless. Carl Orlando said he drove one truck where the dashboard caught fire. Orlando recalled another shift, this one on a cold winter night, when the air line in his brakes froze. To stop the truck, he crashed it into a utility pole.</p>\n<p>Queens County’s owner, Bilik, disputes that his trucks were ever “anything less than safe,” adding “we have recently replaced almost our entire fleet.” And he denies that a driver would ever have been required to drive a truck he’d flagged for failing brakes. Queens County trucks were pulled off the road for being unsafe after 12 of the last 16 inspections, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>Federal Department of Transportation regulations require that truck operators maintain logbooks of inspections, but Orlando and Perez allege that Anthony LaPuma of Queens County Carting gave instructions to falsify the records. “You put ‘Everything is good’ on the report, and then you write on a piece of paper what is wrong and you give that to the mechanic. When you get pulled over, the DOT will see that everything is good,” Perez remembered LaPuma saying. (Bilik called the allegation “fictional.” He added, “We run a tight ship here.”)</p>\n<p>In 2007, LaPuma was among four defendants <a href=\"http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2007/november/lombardo_lapuma_mistretta_11_08_2007_ind.pdf\">indicted</a> in Queens for trying to take over another waste company by setting fire to garbage trucks, stealing 205 of their containers and threatening to kill the owner. LaPuma pleaded guilty to first-degree attempted falsifying of business records, a felony. He did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>At 7:30 p.m., Caban made his way south on Franklin Avenue in Bed-Stuy, reversing diagonally against traffic through the intersection at Lafayette Avenue to get the garbage from a deli across the street from Dough Donuts, then drove diagonally back into southbound traffic. Bilal perched on the stepper with his back pressed to the truck (hanging wide increases the odds of getting knocked off and run over, another common way to die, according to the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health). When the squeeze was tight with a parked car, Bilal swung gracefully from the back right stepper up into the truck’s hopper.</p>\n<p>With less experienced helpers, Caban taught them what they needed to know. “Place your back, your legs, and your arms like if you’re swinging a golf club,” he explained. Swinging a bag like a baseball bat will risk spraying garbage juice in your partner’s eyes or mouth. Hold the bag away from your body to avoid gashes from glass. For lighter bags, use a down-and-up-and-over torso twist-swing. For heavier ones, over 70 or 80 pounds, do a full 360-degree spin-and-drag move, not unlike an Olympic hammer throw, using the weight of the bag to gain momentum.</p>\n<p>At the Putnam Deli on the corner of Classon Avenue, Caban tossed bags into the hopper and then ran inside to get his first bottled water of the night. Caban, who is Muslim, chatted in Arabic with the proprietor while Nancy, the bodega cat, looked on. Arabic was one of several languages he taught himself in jail.</p>\n<aside>For many men with a criminal record, private sanitation is one of the few jobs they can get.</aside>\n<p>Caban has a rap sheet that included several felonies and trips “upstate,” as he called New York state prison, for drug, violence and other convictions. Caban readily admitted that his criminal record was “messed up,” and as a result his job options were severely curtailed. To his great frustration, he knew there were many other kinds of work besides hauling garbage that he was capable of doing: work that paid more and was far less dangerous. But those doors were closed. Driving for Uber, for example, was forever out of reach. He applied for a license from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission and was denied. “So you see,” said Caban, “I’m forced to work in this type of company.”</p>\n<p>For many men with a criminal record, private sanitation is one of the few jobs they can get. When Caban got out of jail, he began as a helper at Viking Sanitation, in south Brooklyn. His first night on the job, he showed up and hopped aboard the back stepper—no training at all, a common way to start in this industry. Other helpers showed Caban the ropes, and after two years of hanging off the back of a garbage truck, he passed the commercial driver’s license exam and road test, and received a license to drive vehicles that weigh more than 26,000 pounds. In making the leap from helper to driver, he went from $120 to $200 per night at Viking. At #1 Waste, he made $1,000 a week working six days a week, routinely driving more than 10 hours a night.</p>\n<p>Caban’s dream was to work at New York City’s Department of Sanitation, but between his criminal record and the intense competition, he couldn’t believe that would ever happen. Picking up residential trash is one of the city’s most coveted municipal jobs. In 2015, more than 68,000 people took the sanitation civil service exam; it was the first time in eight years DSNY had offered the exam, and the department hires only about 500 people a year off the list. With seniority and overtime, experienced workers can make $90,000 or more annually. The job, which requires no college degree, offers a chance at a comfortable middle-class life, a five-day work week and the promise of upward mobility.</p>\n<p>Of the many private sanitation workers I talked to for this story—more than 20 in all—again and again I heard the same longing. In their eyes, DSNY workers have won the lottery. One night shift worker said, “We look at them like you made it.”</p>\n<p>Municipal sanitation work is still dangerous, to be sure, but workers undergo weeks of training, and the safety regulations are strict. In recent years, DSNY removed the back steppers from its entire fleet after pressure from the Teamsters.</p>\n<p>The difference between the day shift and the night shift can be measured by pace. In New York, the municipal garbage man almost never runs. He walks. The private carters also work far more hours and hoist way more trash. “We’re going crazy sweating bullets,” said Anthony Carmona, who worked with Caban at Viking Sanitation. “Department of Sanitation, you see them chilling. I wish I could work like that.”</p>\n<p>Carmona still hopes for a city job, but he has since achieved the next best thing: a spot at one of the top private companies. Carmona knew a guy who pulled some strings and got him hired by IESI, the second-largest waste hauler in New York City. It’s a Teamsters shop where starting pay for helpers is $22.40 an hour. The job was still backbreaking—it requires picking up far more tons per night than the day shift at the city—but IESI workers had a pension to look forward to. With overtime, a helper could pull in $70,000-$85,000; an experienced driver at IESI could make $80,000-$110,000 a year. And with that comes medical coverage, paid vacations and sick days. When he wasn’t on the back of an IESI truck—a behemoth outfitted with all the bells and whistles, like a back-up camera for the driver to monitor—he was dreaming of the vacation days he’d save up.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Eric Hyde, another Viking helper, had been cut from working three days a week, to two days, to one day—never knowing which day it’d be, making it nearly impossible to hold a second job. Hyde was now close to losing his apartment. On the Department of Sanitation hiring list, his number was 63,019.</p>\n<p>In this industry, everyone hopes for a break, but few will get one. Hyde said simply: “I’m probably going to die on the back of the truck.”</p>\n<p>As the night wore on, Caban started treating red lights like stop signs: Slow down, look both ways, then go. A little before 9 p.m., Caban stopped at a deli on Pulaski Street, at the edge of Bushwick—a new stop his boss added to the route the night before with a short text message. Routes were always getting longer, but the nightly pay stayed the same.</p>\n<aside>The difference between the day shift and the night shift can be measured by pace.</aside>\n<p>Caban made his way down Broadway in Brooklyn, then headed to Speedy Gas on Metropolitan Avenue to refuel. It was their first, brief rest after four breakneck hours. With his glasses atop his head, Caban played a phone game while Bilal put 62 gallons of diesel into the truck’s underbelly tank. Then Caban handed him a plastic bag and a rubber band. “Be sure to make it nice and tight,” Caban told him. “Strong—strong like bull.” Their truck had no gas cap.</p>\n<p>Shortly before 10 p.m., Caban headed to Hi-Tech Resource Recovery, one of New York’s 60 waste transfer stations (half of which are located in three black and Latino neighborhoods—north Brooklyn, the south Bronx and southeast Queens). Hi-Tech, which looks like a massive warehouse from the street, sits in an industrial but gentrifying area now known as East Williamsburg. From Hi-Tech, the garbage would get loaded onto long-haul trucks and carted to landfills and recycling centers hundreds of miles away.</p>\n<p>From there, Caban headed toward the Williamsburg Bridge. He would spend the second half of the night in Manhattan, picking up cardboard. Garbage and cardboard can’t (or rather, shouldn’t) mix in the truck. On other nights, the order was reversed: garbage stops in Manhattan then cardboard stops in Brooklyn. Learning the route meant memorizing which stops were which—garbage or cardboard—and on which days of the week, and how much to pick up (businesses pay by weight). A stop might be only cardboard on a Wednesday, or only garbage on Mondays and Thursdays, or only garbage on Tuesdays, or every day.</p>\n<p>How did he keep all the stops straight? “You learn. Trust me,” said Caban. “If you don’t learn, you don’t get to drive for them too often.” Businesses tend to complain about smelly trash left on their curb, or getting a ticket for a pile of cardboard that never got picked up.</p>\n<p>Caban stopped at a deli, a pizzeria and a grocery on Pitt Street just above Delancey Street on the Lower East Side. He carried a small packing knife with a retractable blade of about 2.5 inches, using it to slash through the cords of unwieldy bundles of cardboard, making the job go faster. Cardboard can be easier than garbage—at times it’s lighter—except when it isn’t. Some stops had 300-pound bales of cardboard, which Caban and Bilal had to lift together, bringing them from the pavement to a winch mounted onto the back of the truck. Tonight, luckily, it did not bash his head in.</p>\n<p>To stay awake the rest of the night, Caban followed his routine: coffee, Red Bull when it got bad and 5-Hour Energy when it got really bad. As the hours wore on, the streets grew quiet. That was another reason he kept the packing knife on him. One night they were stopped on a deserted Manhattan street, and three guys jumped Bilal and punched him, according to Caban. He came to Bilal’s rescue with his knife at the ready.</p>\n<p>Caban and Bilal made their way up First Avenue. On other nights he continued up to the top of Manhattan, to stops at 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, but not tonight. Tonight, the two men picked up cardboard from the Crown Fried Chicken on 163rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, then headed west to Broadway and south. A fish market, a pizzeria, a deli, Boost Mobile, another Crown Fried Chicken—toward Second Avenue and then all the way back downtown.</p>\n<p>When Caban passed other garbage trucks, they honked their horns in salute. “We know we down in this shithole together,” he said.</p>\n<p>The stops became a blur. By the end of the night, when Caban did stop for red lights, he fell asleep at the wheel.</p>\n<p>A little before 4:30 a.m., he parked the truck back at the yard. Pacific Street was desolate. Caban and Bilal had made good time, finishing the route in about 10 1/2 hours. Still, Caban was exhausted.</p>\n<p>Driving back to his apartment, he passed the hulking armory building on Pacific Street, a homeless men’s shelter dubbed Grayskull Castle. He had lived there after getting out of jail. After he got the job at Viking Sanitation and got a place of his own, each injury that put him out of work left him feeling one step closer to Grayskull Castle.</p>\n<p>He got home and took a shower. The next night he would do the same thing again.</p>\n<p>July turned into August 2016, and Caban’s garbage bags grew heavier and juicier. In the summertime, New Yorkers go out more and spend more money, making more garbage for workers to lift off the street. On a summer night, a truck might pick up five or 10 more tons than it would in the winter.</p>\n<p>The next time I checked in with Caban in late summer, he told me he was too tired to talk. Eventually, Caban and I lost touch.</p>\n<p>This fall, I learned that he is incarcerated. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I took the Q100 bus to Rikers Island to find out what had transpired in the year since. The bus pulled up to the front building, the planes of LaGuardia Airport visible just across the water. The passengers—almost entirely women and children on their way to visiting hours—got off. There was space set aside near the entrance to park strollers.</p>\n<p>It would take almost four hours to make it through the many rounds of metal detectors, searches and long periods of sitting in waiting areas that lead to other waiting areas. “Jail is mad stressful,” said a young woman who was visiting her boyfriend. She laughed, then grew quiet and put her head in her hand. “I feel like I live here.”</p>\n<p>Alex Caban entered the large gymnasium that served as a visiting hall and took a seat across the table from me. To my right, an inmate in a gray jumpsuit smiled down at a toddler in his arms. The wall to the left was a big Sesame Street mural: Bert and Ernie waved while Grover flew above in the sky holding aloft the New York City Department of Correction shield. Caban recounted the events that led him to Rikers. I committed what I could to memory; a guard had instructed me to put my notebook and phone in a locker.</p>\n<p>Caban said his trouble began in August 2016, when he got a call about an opportunity to earn more money at another carting company. “I never should have left #1 Waste,” he said.</p>\n<p>As Caban told it, two of his new coworkers repeatedly used a Latino slur against him. Soon, Caban was at the end of his rope. On Aug. 31, 2016, according to Caban, the slurs continued and things heated up. He took out his packing knife and stabbed one of the coworkers. “I’m not a young guy like they are,” said Caban by way of explanation. “I didn’t want to fight them.”</p>\n<p>Caban was arrested but got out on bail. He then bounced around working at different garbage companies. He had a short stint back at #1 Waste, but then one night while driving a truck that he said was missing a side mirror, he backed into a woman’s new Volkswagen. His career at #1 Waste was soon over.</p>\n<p>In the spring, Caban landed at a company called Yankel’s. He began driving a roll-off truck—the kind that typically carries a 10- to 40-cubic yard dumpster that “rolls off” onto the ground. Whereas before Caban heaved garbage by hand, now the machinery of the well-maintained Yankel’s truck did the lifting. Plus, it was a day shift job with a proper weekend: The owners were observant Jews, and all work came to a halt before sundown on Fridays. Caban posted photos online of himself at the wheel, happy to finally be driving a truck that other men would call pretty. “This truck smells like new car!” he told friends.</p>\n<p>But soon it was time to head to court again. He pleaded guilty to a third-degree misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to a year in jail, which he began serving in June 2017.</p>\n<p>Inmates at the Eric M. Taylor Center, where Caban was incarcerated, often do the trash pick-up for the ten jails on Rikers Island. But Caban said he was working in a bakery, where he likely earns less than 50 cents an hour. For once, he told me, he has enough time to sleep, exercise, pray and read books, most recently “Lies My Teacher Told Me,” a critique of the Eurocentric history taught to schoolchildren. Caban told me that Bilal, his helper from the summer before, is now working as a driver for #1 Waste.</p>\n<p>Caban was thinking about the future, and it was weighing on him. He was now 46. If he returned to the garbage man’s life of working six nights a week and sleeping days, when would he ever meet someone, let alone go on a date? A nice meal out on a Saturday night, he told me, would surely end with him falling asleep at the table. “I can’t be alone anymore,” he said. This was a theme I’d heard again and again from other workers. Relationships failed, marriages ended. “You’re never there,” I offered, echoing the words of other men. “And when you’re there,” Caban added, “you’re not there.”</p>\n<p>Caban looked forward to his release in 2018. He said he might take some garbage shifts to save up money, but ultimately he wanted to move on up in the world of commercial trucking: getting a Class A license. He wanted to drive a car-transport tractor-trailer or perhaps a big rig. Or maybe he and some friends would buy some property to fix up and start a business of their own. His career as a garbage man, he hoped, was coming to an end.</p>\n<p><em>ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

How big? Just ask him. “Oh, are you happy you voted for me,” the president cooed during his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-american-farm-bureau-annual-convention-nashville-tn/\">speech</a> at the American Farm Bureau Federation’s 99th annual convention in Nashville on Monday. “Oh, you are so lucky I gave you that privilege.”</p>\n<aside>“Oh, are you happy you voted for me,” the president cooed.</aside>\n<p>The Farm Bureau is a <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000021832\">powerful lobbying organization</a> with sprawling insurance interests and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/whose-side-american-farm-bureau/\">strong ties to agribusiness</a>. US presidents have an open invitation to address the group’s big meet-up; Trump was the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/us/politics/trump-farmers-agriculture-trade-taxes.html?_r=0\">first to take the bait in a quarter century</a>.  </p>\n<p>His preening lines (starting around 23:20 in the above video) inspired a curiously muted applause from the audience compared to the rousing cheers he elicited during other parts of the speech. The flat reception underlines Trump’s dilemma in farm country as the 2018 mid-term elections approach. His administration has delivered on the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2016/08/meet-man-advising-donald-trump-ag-policy/\">main promises it made to farmers</a> during the 2016 campaign: gutting regulation and easing the burden of the estate tax. But those promises actually amount to very little in the face of a struggling farm economy beset by years of low commodity prices, labor shortages exacerbated by an immigration crackdown, and fears of imperiled export markets as Trump threatens to roll back trade deals like the North American Free Trade Act.  </p>\n<p>Take deregulation. At his Nashville speech, the president trumpeted the administration’s move, back in March, to overturn the Waters of the US rule, a clarification of the Clean Water Act mandated by a <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-1034\" target=\"_blank\">2006 Supreme Court decision</a>. According to Trump, crushing WOTUS, as it’s known, was a heroic act that essentially saved the family farm. “Men that were tough and strong, women that were tough and strong, they’d see me, there were tears coming down their eyes, because I gave them back their property, I gave them back their farms,” he claimed.  </p>\n<p>The crowd roared at Trump’s WOTUS victory lap, but the idea that the president delivered farms back to people is nonsense. As I showed in <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/03/trumps-latest-gift-big-ag-empty-gesture/\">this post</a>, the Waters of the US rule—like the Clean Water Act itself—exempted farming activities from its purview.  The Farm Bureau itself <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/issues/regulatory-reform/clean-water-act/\">did its best to whip farmers into a frenzy against it,</a> even though it had little effect on them. </p>\n<p>He told another fairy tale about what he called the “deeply unfair estate tax.” Until recently, estates valued at $5.5 million and higher were forced to pay an estate tax of 40 percent. The recent GOP tax overhaul pushed the threshold to $11 million. Before that act of largesse, farm families typically “were forced to take these farms and sell them at a fire-sale price,” he claimed. “That’s not gonna happen anymore, folks. Not gonna happen.” In reality, just 0.4 percent of US farm estates were big enough for the tax in 2016, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/federal-tax-issues/federal-estate-taxes/\">US Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>\n<aside>The great bulk of the tax overhaul’s benefits will accrue to the very largest farmers, while the smallest farms will actually pay more. </aside>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Trump also congratulated farmers on the broader benefits they’ll receive from the tax overhaul, which he described as “5.5 trillion dollars in tax cuts, with most of those benefits going to working families, small businesses, and—who?—family farmers.” I won’t tackle the broader claims. As for impact in farm country, as I <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/most-american-farmers-will-be-hurt-by-the-gop-tax-bill/\">reported</a> and was recently confirmed by a new <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/1910?q=eNo1jF0KgCAQhO8yzwb14Ivn6AKSGyxkiiuFhHfPDXqaH-abB0JcIpzOtWWCe_4IhwXdwIukbQQYVCpxuN0PMbiYbt0Hqp4PCh9gUHIezs7KBt-0nazCHElv-gsSKiHs\">paper</a> from US Department of Agriculture economists, the great bulk of its benefits will accrue to the very largest farmers. According to the paper, the very largest farms will grab as much as 70 percent of the tax reductions, while the smallest farms will actually pay more. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, prices of major commodities like corn and soybeans remain mired in a <a href=\"http://www.omaha.com/money/continued-low-prices-have-some-corn-and-soybean-growers-trying/article_cd2535bc-dd45-11e7-a379-7ff0c76120bd.htmlhttp://www.omaha.com/money/continued-low-prices-have-some-corn-and-soybean-growers-trying/article_cd2535bc-dd45-11e7-a379-7ff0c76120bd.html\">multi-year slump</a> and farm labor shortages <a href=\"https://www.columbian.com/news/2018/jan/08/farms-face-shrinking-labor-pool/\">linger</a>. Trump’s bluster won him <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/10/trump-farmers/\">massive support among farmers</a> in 2016. As the hollow nature of his gifts to them sets in, it’s hard to see how his popularity in farm country will hold out through the mid-terms. Indeed, in the iconic farm state of Iowa, at least, Trump’s appeal is on the wane, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/iowa-went-big-for-trump-but-there-are-signs-its-voters-are-souring-on-the-president/2018/01/01/e84cc764-e73c-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html?utm_term=.8c00403b45a9\">reports</a> <em>The Washington Post’s</em> David Weigel.</p>",

The key problem, of course, is defining “about to.” When GDP starts bumping up against potential GDP—which is happening now—that’s an obvious danger sign.

So, all I can say is that you can say anything you want to say about the guy. I said he was a xenophobic, race-baiting religious bigot. I ran out of things to say. He won. Guess what? He’s our president.”</p>\n<p>“You’re calling him a xenophobic, religious bigot?” co-host Joy Behar asked.</p>\n<p>“I did that during the campaign,” Graham said. “I did.”</p>\n<p>When pressed whether he still believes that his past characterizations of Trump hold, Graham answered: “No, I don’t think he’s a xenophobic, race-baiting religious bigot—as president.” </p>\n<p>In recent months, Graham has slowly emerged as something of a Trump “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-lindsey-graham-best-friends.html\">whisperer</a>” in the Oval Office, with the two known to play golf together and work collaboratively on legislation. “Lindsey used to be a great enemy of mine, and now he’s a great friend of mine,” Trump said <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-meeting-immigration-republican-members-senate/\">during a meeting on immigration Thursday</a>. “I really like Lindsey. Can you believe that? I never thought I’d say that, but I do like him a lot.”</p>\n<p>The next day, the president’s admiration for his new friend likely grew when Graham, along with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), called for a criminal investigation into Christophe Steele, the former British spy who authored the infamous Trump dossier. Democrats slammed the decision as politically motivated and an attempt to distract from <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/republican-senators-target-christopher-steele-and-the-reason-is-obvious/\">Trump’s potential times to the Kremlin.</a> Graham on Monday defended the criminal recommendation, adding that he did not believe informants should “take their work product and give it to the FBI and the media at the same time.”</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NmFc_6V0bc?feature=oembed\" width=\"990\" height=\"557\"></iframe></p>",

This spring, when Customs and Border Protection requested bids for private contractors to help fulfill Trump’s order, it wrote that <strong>it now takes 133 applicants to hire one full-time employee.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Not only is it harder than ever to find qualified agents, it’s not clear why we need them in the first place. Here’s what border apprehensions look like over the past decade:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_southwest_border_apprehensions_seasonal_2008_2017.gif\" class=\"wp-image-544477\" height=\"494\"></figure>\n<p>Apprehensions went down substantially during President Obama’s first three years in office. Was this due to the Great Recession or to tougher enforcement? Some of both, I think, but the recession must not have been a huge factor since the 2008-11 decline merely continued a trend that started under the Bush administration—and apprehension numbers have stayed low ever since, even as the economy has expanded. In President Trump’s first year, apprehensions went down even further.</p>\n<p>Here’s what this means in terms of Border Patrol staffing:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_southwest_border_agents_per_apprehension_2008_2018.gif\" class=\"wp-image-544491\" height=\"506\"></figure>\n<p>A decade ago, it took less than one-quarter of an agent to make an apprehension each month. Today it takes four times as many. And if Trump has his way, it will take five times as many.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t make much sense. Illegal immigration is down, and it seems to be down permanently. Why do we need five times more agents per apprehension than we did in 2008? Not only is it dangerous to hire this many new agents at once, possibly at the cost of lowering standards, but it seems like a waste of money too.</p>",

The episode turned Bundy into a folk hero of the right. On Monday, Judge Gloria Navarro threw out the conspiracy charges against Bundy, his two sons, and another man, citing “flagrant prosecutorial misconduct” on the part of US government lawyers.</p>\n<p>As <em>Mother Jones </em>previously reported, the government failed to turn over critical information in the case, causing the judge to<em> </em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/the-government-has-screwed-up-the-bundy-case-even-worse-than-we-realized/\" target=\"_blank\">declare a mistrial</a> last month:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the heart of the case against the Bundys is a conspiracy charge alleging that the Bundys and other defendants lied about their situation when they sent out urgent national requests for militia members and other armed protesters to come to Bunkerville to face off against the BLM. The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/830656/download\">indictment</a> alleges that the family used “deceit and deception” to recruit followers and gunmen, falsely claiming that the BLM had surrounded the Bundy ranch with snipers and that federal officers had used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqWYLArDqQ\">excessive force against Cliven’s son Dave Bundy</a>, who was arrested a few days before the armed standoff while taking photos and protesting along a state highway.</p>\n<p>But those claims, dismissed by the government as fiction by paranoid anti-government activists, have largely turned out to be true. And it’s taken the government nearly two years, and three trials, to admit as much in court.</p>\n<p>The first disclosure came during an evidentiary hearing in October, just days before jury selection was set to begin. Ryan Bundy, representing himself, questioned a National Park Service employee <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/secret-video-camera-gives-bundys-a-surprise-victory-at-start-of-trial/\">about the surveillance cameras</a> he alleged were set up near the ranch. The government had denied that they existed, but the Park Service employee acknowledged the presence of at least one camera trained on the ranch that was operated by the FBI. She said she had viewed some of the footage from it. In the same hearing, the defense was able for the first time to question Dan Love, the special agent in charge of the BLM’s law enforcement operation at the Bundy ranch. He <a href=\"https://www.oathkeepers.org/bunkerville-trial-dan-love-now-whistle-blower/\">disclosed during his testimony</a> that there were indeed snipers around the ranch and that the government had commissioned a number of threat assessment reports on the Bundys. Those reports had not been turned over to the defense lawyers, despite their requests for them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On Monday, Navarro <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bundy-mistrial-2018-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">ruled</a> that the government’s conduct had been so egregious that a new trial could not go forward.</p>\n<p>Bundy’s critics fear the outcome will embolden Bundy and his allies to continue to buck federal laws. “Federal prosecutors clearly bungled this case and let the Bundys get away with breaking the law,” said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “The Bundys rallied a militia to mount an armed insurrection against the government. The failure of this case will only embolden this violent and racist anti-government movement that wants to take over our public lands.”</p>\n<p>Now that the charges have been thrown out, Bundy’s supporters can end their <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/will-trump-pardon-cliven-bundy-1/\" target=\"_blank\">quest to get him a presidential pardon from Donald Trump</a>.</p>",

This chart, which doesn’t get nearly enough attention, shows the change in first-year presidential approval ratings <em>from copartisans</em>. That is, it shows Democratic approval of Democrats and Republican approval of Republicans:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_presidential_approval_copartisans_first_year.gif\" class=\"wp-image-544449\" height=\"503\"></figure>\n<p>After an admittedly wild first year in which he disappointed liberals with his budget, gays in the military, and a missile attack on Iraq, Bill Clinton ended 1993 exactly where he started. George Bush got a huge bump across the board after 9/11, but even if you look at his approval rating through 9/10, he only lost about one percent of his support. In 2009, during a brutal recession, Obama lost three percent of his support by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump has lost eight percent of his support among Republicans. During a strong economy.</p>\n<p>I know these seem like small numbers, but they’re meaningful. It’s natural that presidents lose support among independents and members of the opposing party. Many of them want to “give the new president a chance,” and then slip away as politics takes its natural course. But polarization being what it is, recent presidents just don’t lose much support among their own party. Only in Trump’s case has there been any significant erosion.</p>\n<p>Losing the support of people who probably didn’t vote for you in the first place doesn’t mean too much. But losing the support of people who <em>did</em> vote for you means electoral disaster. <strong>It’s also good news:</strong> Americans aren’t reacting to the norm-busting buffoonery of the Trump presidency with indifference. Not only is the opposition movement enormously energized, but even Republicans are losing faith in him.</p>\n<p>The 9/11 attacks rescued George Bush. Something similar could still happen with Trump, so this is hardly a call to breathe a sigh of relief. The fight is everything. But keep in mind that the fight is working. This is why I think, in the end, Trump will end up being a weird outlier in American history, not a harbinger of things to come.</p>",

A senior administration official said on a call with reporters that conditions related to the earthquakes “no longer exist.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Since the earthquakes, El Salvador has become one of the most violent countries in the world. In 2017, El Salvador’s murder rate was <a href=\"https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/El-Salvador-es-el-pais-con-mas-homicidios-de-Centroamerica-20180102-0444.html\">64</a> per 100,000 people. That was down from 81 in 2016, but it remains the most dangerous country in Central America.

The senior administration official said that violence “doesn’t really apply” to whether El Salvador’s earthquake-related TPS designation is extended. In addition to environmental disasters, TPS can be granted because of “ongoing armed conflict,” as well as “other extraordinary and temporary conditions,” according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services. </span></p>\n<p><span>Right-wing immigration groups have pushed for years to end TPS for El Salvador, arguing that the designation was never meant to be permanent.

In November, the Trump administration <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/the-trump-administration-revokes-legal-status-for-more-than-50000-haitian-immigrants/\">announced</a> that more than 50,000 Haitians will lose their TPS status in July 2019. Earlier that month, former acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/things-arent-looking-good-for-300000-central-americans-and-haitians-living-legally-in-the-us/\">granted</a> 57,000 Hondurans an extension until July 2018 as the agency mulls a final decision. Monday’s El Salvador decision suggests that DHS is likely to end TPS for Hondurans as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The administration official said the US economic impact of ending Salvadorans’ TPS was not part of DHS’ decision-making process. On the call, administration officials were also asked if they had numbers for how many US-born children would be impacted by the decision.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I don’t have that handy,” one replied. “No we do not,” said another.

        "content": "<p>Annetta Coffman can name 35 people in her neighborhood who have recently died from cancer—and that includes her own family. Coffman’s mother died of cancer in 2007, and three years ago her 18-year-old son was diagnosed with cancer. “Every single neighbor I’ve had has died of cancer,” Coffman told <em>Mother Jones. </em></p>\n<p>Coffman lives in Minden, West Virginia, an impossibly small town of roughly 250 people in the heart of Appalachia, where coal mining once made it a thriving community. Now, all that remains are dilapidated homes and toxic waste that residents say is making them sick at an alarming rate. Fayette County, where Minden is located, struggles with high unemployment and poverty; the county of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/fayettecountywestvirginia/PST045216\">more than 44,000 people</a> had an unemployment rate of nearly 8 percent in 2016, while 19 percent of the population lives in poverty.</p>\n<p>The story of Minden is yet another example of how toxic pollution harms the poorest and vulnerable communities the most.</p>\n<p>From 1970 to 1984, the Minden-based Shaffer Equipment Company <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=12080\">built electrical equipment</a> for the coal industry. Oil that contained polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs were used in the transformers and other equipment that was later disposed of into an abandoned mine site in Minden. PCBs, which are highly toxic and have been linked to certain types of cancer, were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. But the chemical is stubbornly persistent. </p>\n<p>In September 1984, the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=12080\">inspected the Shaffer site</a> and found that old equipment dumped at the mine was contaminating the soil at Arbuckle, a nearby creek. The state asked the EPA to come in and investigate. In two separate clean-ups over the course of seven years, a team led by Bob Caron from the regional EPA office <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=12080\">removed contaminated soil</a> at the Minden site. The first took place between December 1984 and December 1987, while the second one lasted from November 1990 to January 1991.</p>\n<p>One year later, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/07/18/tainted-epa-witness-scuttles-effort-by-us-to-recover-cleanup-cost/2c7203f2-f667-41ab-b3f8-bc6064512192/?utm_term=.4e790114d885\">federal government sued</a> the Shaffer Equipment Company and two other defendants that had disposed of materials at the site in order to recoup the $5 million it lost cleaning up the site—a common practice under these circumstances. There was just one problem: Bob Caron had lied about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/07/18/tainted-epa-witness-scuttles-effort-by-us-to-recover-cleanup-cost/2c7203f2-f667-41ab-b3f8-bc6064512192/?utm_term=.4e790114d885\">his credentials</a>. The so-called hazardous waste expert <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/07/18/tainted-epa-witness-scuttles-effort-by-us-to-recover-cleanup-cost/2c7203f2-f667-41ab-b3f8-bc6064512192/?utm_term=.4e790114d885\">claimed </a>to have a Bachelor of Science degree from Rutgers University in New Jersey and a master’s degree in organic chemistry from Drexel University in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>He had neither.</p>\n<p>Shaffer was able to get <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/07/18/tainted-epa-witness-scuttles-effort-by-us-to-recover-cleanup-cost/2c7203f2-f667-41ab-b3f8-bc6064512192/?utm_term=.4e790114d885\">the suit dismissed</a> and distrust grew among the remaining Minden residents. A lot of people believed that because Caron was a fraud, “the work he was doing was subpar,” says Richardson. Meanwhile, residents say their health continued to suffer.</p>\n<aside>“The cap is a band-aid over a bullet wound. Here were are years later, and it’s still toxic.”</aside>\n<p>In 1997, an arsonist set the remaining building that contained <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=12080\">contaminated materials on fire</a>. The EPA returned to do another assessment and the US Army Corps of Engineers designed a cap for the toxic soil and building debris, which was completed in 2002. “The cap is a Band-Aid over a bullet wound,” Brandon Richardson, the founder of Headwaters Defense, a local environmental group, says. “Here we are years later, and it’s still toxic.”</p>\n<p>Though residents feel as if the EPA has been ignoring their issues for years,  Roy Seneca, the EPA Region 3 press officer, told <em>Mother Jones</em> that “EPA’s responsibility to Minden is no different than any other city,” which suggests that the agency doesn’t believe it has failed the town.</p>\n<p>Coffman began hearing stories about toxic waste issues when she was a young girl in the 1980s, but initially she didn’t give it a second thought. After her mother’s death from uterine, breast, and ovarian cancer in 2007, however, she began to wonder if all the cancer in her community wasn’t just a coincidences. Last year, she created a Facebook page where people can message her about their experiences with cancer in the area. “This isn’t a recent emergency,” Coffman says. “This is long-term neglect.” On the Facebook page, Coffman posts the photos and stories from the loved ones of cancer victims. </p>\n<aside>This isn’t a recent emergency, this is long-term neglect.”</aside>\n<p>Today, many people are on edge. Coffman has two nephews, aged 11 and 12, who come to visit her, but because they live so close to Arbuckle Creek,  “I don’t feel comfortable letting them go outside and be normal kids.”</p>\n<p>Corman and others in the community began to pressure the EPA to return to their area, and finally, last  June, the agency <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=12080\">went back to Minden</a> to do more testing of the Shaffer Equipment site and Arbuckle Creek to determine if further action is required. According to the <a href=\"http://www.fayettetribune.com/news/epa-begins-sampling-but-minden-residents-remain-distrustful/article_5775c7f0-54a6-11e7-9b0b-a341ad4d278f.html\"><em>Fayette Tribune</em></a>, of the 20 total sites tested, only one was done in the predominantly black neighborhood closest to the contamination site.</p>\n<p>That same month, Dr. Hassan Amjad began going door-to-door to do a survey of cancer diagnoses in town. Dr. Amjad, who <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjJrJ6Gp57YAhXwcd8KHfbOD7AQFggpMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.register-herald.com%2Fnews%2Fdr-hassan-amjad-dies-of-sudden-illness%2Farticle_229a98e4-8da9-11e7-9920-fbb4252fd1d7.html&usg=AOvVaw20XMwBe0k7HRD70t6ecajL\">passed away unexpectedly</a> in August, believed there was a link between the contaminated site and cancers. </p>\n<p>Richardson’s environmental group conducted similar surveys. “We counted 110 people in the last four years who have been diagnosed or have died from cancer,” he says.</p>\n<p>Residents think their cancer problem is being ignored. “EPA has no evidence of that,” of a cancer cluster in Minden. Seneca said. “However, technically that is not our determination.” In July, West Virginia Bureau of Public Health spokesman Toby Wagoner said the <a href=\"http://www.register-herald.com/news/minden-resident-questions-errors-in-federal-pcb-report/article_591de7ec-725d-51a8-bfcc-505403d9965b.html\">data does not support a cancer cluster</a> in Minden.</p>\n<p>Still, the numbers seem to reveal a different reality, and residents say they feel slighted when officials tell them they’re not living in a cancer cluster. “It’s hurtful and it’s disappointing,” Coffman says. “I feel like if it was a community with better socioeconomics, it would be looked at differently.” </p>\n<p>In October, the EPA announced it had found a “troubling” amount of PCBs at the sites it tested, but <a href=\"https://www.wvgazettemail.com/business/epa-says-more-testing-needed-at-minden-superfund-site/article_5199242e-ca85-50f5-b8ab-a4982643a59c.html\">more testing</a> needed to be done in order to determine next steps. In an email, Seneca said the agency is “examining the ongoing protection of the cap” placed over the site in 2002 and will “conduct cleanup” if any EPA sampling warrants it.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Minden residents have been lobbying to be put on the EPA’s Superfund National Priorities List. Superfund is a program that identifies and cleans up toxic sites around the country. West Virginia <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/wv/list-superfund-sites-west-virginia\">currently has 10</a> such sites, but in order to be added to the list, the EPA must decide if the site is eligible and the state of West Virginia must agree with the listing. “Those events have not occurred,” Seneca said. “They may in the future.”</p>\n<p>Since being appointed, EPA head Scott Pruitt has angered environmentalists with his broad attempts to roll back regulations designed to protect humans and the environment. But he has said cleaning up toxic sites are one of his main priorities. </p>\n<p>Community members have also asked Republican Gov. Jim Justice to help move the residents of the entire town to another area. “Minden is so toxic,” Richardson says, “the majority of people want to leave.” </p>\n<aside>“Minden is so toxic,” Richardson says, “the majority of people want to leave.” </aside>\n<p>Relocating residents of toxic communities is not without precedent. Mossville, Louisiana, a historically black town in the state’s heavily polluted area known as Cancer Alley, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/sasol-mossville-louisiana/\">faced its own potential demise</a> in 2014, after a massive chemical plant sought to expand. The South African company polluted the air, water, and soil and made the overwhelming majority of residents fall ill with central nervous system disorders. By 2015, nearly all the residents had <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/planet/2015/07/louisiana-man-takes-stand-against-petrochemical-giant\">taken buyouts</a> and moved away.</p>\n<p>And that’s what Coffman wants for her community. “I love our community,” Coffman says. “I love the neighbors I’ve known since I was a little girl.” But still, she can’t fathom staying in her hometown for much longer. “I don’t want to wonder if I’m going to be the next person who gets cancer.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thirty years ago, the United States had a big problem. Barely half of eligible voters had cast a ballot in the 1988 presidential election—the lowest voter turnout since the 1920s. In an effort to increase participation, Democrats in Congress—backed by a few Republicans— drafted the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-national-voter-registration-act\">National Voter Registration Act</a>, a bill that would require states to allow voters to register at Department of Motor Vehicle offices and other public agencies.</p>\n<p>Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, led the opposition to the legislation. “This bill wants to turn every agency, bureau, and office of state government into a vast voter registration machine,” <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/wendell_ford_s_greatest_accomplishment_the_former_kentucky_senator_who_defied.html\">McConnell said</a> in 1991. “Motor voter registration, hunting permit voter registration, marriage license voter registration, welfare voter registration—even drug rehab voter registration.” That same year, McConnell, who is now the Senate majority leader<strong>,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/1991/1001/01192.html\">wrote</a> that “low voter turnout is a sign of a content democracy.”</p>\n<aside>“We’re seeing a coming fight over how voter rolls are maintained. It’s a new front in the voter suppression battles.”</aside>\n<p>The NVRA passed Congress in 1992, but President George H. W. Bush <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=21191\">vetoed it</a>. Congress passed it again a year later, and this time President Bill Clinton <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=46583\">signed it into law</a>, calling it “a sign of a new vibrancy in our democracy.” The “motor voter” law, as it became known, was an immediate success. In its first year in effect, more than <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/registering-millions-success-and-potential-national-voter-registration-act-20\">30 million people</a> registered or updated their registrations through the NVRA. Roughly <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/miles-rapoport/motor-voter-at-20-success_b_3303857.html\">16 million people</a> per year have used it to register ever since.</p>\n<p>But in recent years, Republicans have sought to gut the law. In 2013, the Supreme Court weakened a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">key part of the Voting Rights Act</a>, ruling that states with long histories of voting discrimination no longer needed to clear their election changes with the federal government. After winning that fight, Republicans are now going after the NVRA in what voting rights advocates say is a thinly veiled effort to make it more difficult for Democratic-leaning constituencies to register to vote—and far easier for state officials to remove them from the voter rolls. “We’re seeing a coming fight over how voter rolls are maintained,” says Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. “It’s a new front in the voter suppression battles.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear the newest challenge to the law, concerning whether Ohio can remove voters from the rolls who don’t vote over a six-year period. If a voter in Ohio misses an election, doesn’t respond to a subsequent mailing from the state, and then sits out two more elections, he or she is removed from the registration list, even if this person would otherwise be eligible to vote. Critics of this process say it turns voting into a “<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/trump-administration-on-the-right-to-vote-use-it-or-lose-it/\">use it or lose it</a>” right and will open the door to <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/the-supreme-court-is-about-to-hear-a-case-that-could-unleash-a-new-wave-of-voter-purges/\">wider voter purges</a>.</p>\n<p>Ohio <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/as-the-gop-convention-begins-ohio-is-purging-tens-of-thousands-of-democratic-voters/\">purged 2 million voters</a> from 2011 to 2016,<strong> </strong>more than any other state, including over 840,000 for infrequent voting. At least 144,000 voters in Ohio’s three largest counties, home to Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, have been purged since the 2012 election, with voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods twice as likely to be removed as those in Republican-leaning ones, according to a  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-votingrights-ohio-insight-idUSKCN0YO19D\"><em>Reuters</em> analysis</a>. </p>\n<p>A federal appeals court ruled in September 2016 that the state’s purging of infrequent voters violated the NVRA, which states that someone cannot be removed from the rolls “by reason of the person’s failure to vote.” As a result of that ruling,  <a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2017/02/03/About-7-500-voters-who-were-purged-from-Ohio-voter-registration-rolls-from-2011-2014-then-voted-in-2016.html\">7,500 people</a>  who had been purged from the rolls were reinstated and were able to vote in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-980-ts-merit-brief.pdf\">Ohio says</a> it should be allowed to remove these voters from the rolls under the NVRA, claiming that “a failure to respond to a notice— not a failure to vote—is the sole proximate cause of removal” under its purge program. Ohio adds that if the Supreme Court finds that the NVRA does prohibit its actions, it would raise “serious constitutional questions” about the law. A <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-980-tsac-American-Civil-Rights-Union.pdf\">supporting brief</a> by the American Civil Rights Union, a conservative group that has sued states to <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/these-three-lawyers-are-quietly-purging-voter-rolls-across-the-country/\">force aggressive voter purges</a>, says that if “the NVRA indeed prohibits the states from utilizing inactivity as a factor that leads to deeming a registrant ultimately to be unqualified—as the lower court found—then the NVRA intrudes on the important federalist balance in the Constitution.”</p>\n<p>The Ohio case isn’t the only way Republicans are trying to weaken the motor voter law.</p>\n<p>In 2013,<strong> </strong>Kansas implemented a law championed by Secretary of State Kris Kobach that required people to show a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization papers to register to vote. The proof-of-citizenship law ultimately blocked <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/kris-kobach-wants-to-make-it-harder-to-vote-nationwide-but-hes-already-failing-back-home-in-kansas/\">1 in 7 eligible voters who attempted to register</a>, nearly half of whom were under 30. The ACLU sued, alleging that the law violated the NVRA by preventing people from registering at the DMV. The ACLU won a preliminary injunction in 2016, with a federal appeals court ruling that if the law remained in effect, “there was an almost certain risk that thousands of otherwise qualified Kansans would be unable to vote in November.”</p>\n<p>After the election, Kobach <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/trumps-election-policy-deputy-sought-a-radical-change-to-a-key-voting-law/\">drafted federal<strong> </strong>legislation</a> to amend the NVRA to allow states to require proof of citizenship for registration. He shared his draft with Donald Trump and his top advisers during a meeting in November 2016. Kobach, who later became the vice chair of Trump’s now-defunct election integrity commission, fought relentlessly to shield this proposal from the public and was fined by a federal court last year for telling the court that “no such document exists.”</p>\n<p>The ACLU’s case against Kobach is <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/federal-court-sets-trial-date-aclus-challenge-kris-kobachs-anti-voter-efforts\">going to trial</a> in March. If Kobach wins, the precedent will allow more states to pass similar proof-of-citizenship laws. If he loses, Kobach will no doubt<strong> </strong>intensify his efforts to amend the NVRA. “The NVRA has been abused by organizations like the ACLU,” Kobach told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html?_r=0\"><em>New York Times Magazine</em></a> last year. “They’ve twisted the words to try and say it prevents proof-of-citizenship laws.”</p>\n<p>Even as Republicans are seeking to weaken the NVRA, three conservative lawyers who worked in the George W. Bush Justice Department are turning the law on its head by attempting to use it<strong> </strong>to force states and localities to engage in Ohio-style voter purges. As my colleague <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/these-three-lawyers-are-quietly-purging-voter-rolls-across-the-country/\">Pema Levy reported</a>, they’ve targeted nearly a dozen states, along with small counties in places like Mississippi and Texas with large minority populations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The letter to Noxubee County [Mississippi] alleged that the county was violating a federal law that requires states to keep their rolls up to date. The commissioners maintained that they were following the law. In fall 2015, the ACRU’s [American Civil Rights Union] attorneys began to push the commission to sign a consent decree that would commit the county to vigorous vetting of its registered voter list in order to avoid a lawsuit. Among its provisions, the draft decree would require the commission to send a non-forwardable notice to all registered voters asking them to confirm their eligibility. Every voter who did not fill it out and return it would be put on a list of inactive voters, and anyone on that list who failed to vote in two federal elections would be removed from the rolls.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For its part, the Trump administration has come out squarely in support of voter purges. The Obama Justice Department opposed the Ohio purge program, but Trump’s DOJ abruptly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-reverses-position-to-allow-ohio-to-purge-inactive-voters-from-rolls/2017/08/08/e93c5116-7c35-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html?utm_term=.06d83cbca2f9\">switched sides</a> in the case. “After this Court’s grant of review and the change in Administrations, the Department reconsidered the question,” the DOJ informed the Supreme Court in August. “It has now concluded that the NVRA does not prohibit a State from using nonvoting as the basis for sending a [removal] notice.” </p>\n<p>In June 2017, the DOJ also <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b\">sent a letter</a> to 44 states informing them that it was reviewing their voter list maintenance procedures<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>asking how they planned to “remove the names of ineligible voters.” If Ohio wins at the Supreme Court, it will “certainly embolden” the department and GOP-controlled states to undertake aggressive voter purges, says Vanita Gupta, who headed the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division under Obama and is now president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</p>\n<p>And that would open the door to broader challenges to the NVRA. “It’s a hugely significant case,” Gupta says. “If the court comes out with a broad ruling that says inactivity in voting is sufficient proof to kick a voter off of the rolls, that could have broad implications across the country for how voters are purged off the rolls per the National Voter Registration Act.”</p>",

For at least a decade, no member of Congress had visited the facility—until this sweltering Wednesday afternoon in July.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a cream-colored blazer and black pants, a double string of pearls circling her neck, her softly highlighted, dark hair coiffed just so, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/kamala-harris-went-to-prison-so-others-wont-have-to/\">Kamala Harris is on a fact-finding mission</a>. “This is about my training as a prosecutor,” California’s junior senator tells me later. “I like to go to the scene, and I do that with almost [any] project. I need to see it and I need to hear it—I need to feel it, almost, so that I can have some intuitive sense, as well as some theoretical or intellectual or academic sense, of what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>Harris and a small group of aides walk through hallways lined with inmate artwork, mostly watercolors, into a small classroom where four women, chosen by the warden to describe the facility’s mental health services, are ushered in. We sit in a semicircle as Harris introduces herself, leaning forward with her hands clasped: <em>What’s your name? What’s your offense? Your sentence? Which county were you sentenced in? How often do your groups meet? How many people attend? Are those meetings happening weekly? Monthly? What are your plans for when you’re released? </em>The questions come near rapid-fire; the atmosphere is intensely focused.</p>\n<p>This is the Kamala Harris that millions of Americans saw during this past summer’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, when her persistent questioning—<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/06/kamala-harris-was-interrupted-again-today/\">despite interruptions by male colleagues</a>—made Attorney General <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0nxsyASUc\">Jeff Sessions admittedly “nervous.”</a></p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LD0nxsyASUc?feature=oembed\" width=\"990\" height=\"557\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The trip to Chowchilla was designed to bolster Harris’ bona fides as a criminal justice crusader willing to stand up to the Trump administration’s tough-on-crime agenda. But as much as the trip was about Harris’ future, it was also about her past. As she likes to constantly remind people, she began her career as a prosecutor and has a near-obsessive, decadeslong interest in reforming incarceration, one that has followed her from the district attorney’s office into the state attorney general’s, and now into the US Senate.</p>\n<p>And that is where things, at least politically, start to get complicated.</p>\n<aside>Harris is not interested in crusading from the outside; her mission is to reform the system from within.</aside>\n<p>Harris has long tried to bridge the tricky divide between social progressivism and the work required as a prosecutor—sometimes more successfully than others. As San Francisco’s district attorney, for instance, she <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-won-t-pursue-death-in-cop-2767716.php\">steadfastly refused to seek the death penalty</a> against a man accused of killing a police officer, but later, as California’s attorney general, she <a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/article/kamala-harris-defends-california-s-death-penalty/6418496\">defended the state’s right</a> to use capital punishment. In 2012, she helped win a massive, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-senate-harris-banks-20161016-snap-story.html\">$25 billion settlement with Wells Fargo</a> and other financial institutions for foreclosure abuses, but a year later she <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/01/05/kamala-harris-fails-to-explain-why-she-didnt-prosecute-steven-mnuchins-bank/\">declined to prosecute</a> Steven Mnuchin’s OneWest Bank for foreclosure violations. In 2014, she <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/09/05/california-could-become-the-first-state-to-ban-the-gay-panic-defense/?utm_term=.8330e4e95402\">co-sponsored a bill</a> to outlaw the so-called gay-panic defense in California, a legal strategy that often shielded perpetrators of violent crimes against LGBT people from serious punishment, but a year later she <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ff-prison-board-approves-parole-for-sexreassignment-inmate-20150521-story.html\">sought to block gender reassignment surgery</a> for a transgender prison inmate.</p>\n<p>As a woman of color, she embodies two key Democratic constituencies, and she is beloved by the wing of the party that broke for Hillary Clinton. But among those on the far left, including many die-hard Bernie Sanders supporters, she’s an object of disdain, a Hillary-bot with weak progressive credentials. While that segment of the left might oppose anyone who isn’t one particular septuagenarian, <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/715955/why-leftists-dont-trust-kamala-harris-cory-booker-deval-patrick\">the<em> </em><em>Week</em></a> summed up this critique when it slammed Harris for her “rather Hillary Clinton-esque tendency to say the right thing but not follow through.”</p>\n<p>The contradiction boils down to this: Harris is not interested in crusading from the outside; her mission is to reform the system from within. And no chapter of her life better reveals this dynamic than her days as a newly elected district attorney in San Francisco, working to get one radical program off the ground.</p>\n<p><span>Kamala (pronounced comma-la)</span> Devi Harris’ very existence is arguably a testament to the unique possibilities of 1960s California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, emigrated from Chennai, India, to come to the University of California-Berkeley to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology. Born and raised in Jamaica, her father, Donald Harris, was at the university earning a Ph.D. in economics. Shyamala was supposed to return to India and an arranged marriage, but she fell in love with Donald and political activism. Kamala was born in 1964, and she frequently talks of going with them to civil rights marches as a kid. She also tells a story that once, when she was fussing as a child, her mom asked what she wanted and she yelled back, “fweedom!”</p>\n<p>Her family’s political legacy, though, stretches further back, to India, where her grandfather was active in the fight to gain independence from British colonial rule and her grandmother walked the streets with a bullhorn, telling poor women how to access birth control. “Both of my grandparents impressed upon me their conviction that we each have the capacity and the responsibility to work for a better and more just society,” Harris writes in her 2009 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Crime-Kamala-Harris/dp/0811865282\"><em>Smart on Crime</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Harris attended Howard University, where she majored in political science and economics and was inspired by a strong legacy of black achievement. In 2003, <a href=\"http://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamalas-karma/\">while campaigning for district attorney</a> in San Francisco’s historically black Western Addition neighborhood, she told an audience of young people, “Close your eyes and imagine: Every Friday night, 10,000 students get dressed up and go out in the yard of Howard University. There is a yard filled with thousands of young people who look like you—and they are all college students!”</p>\n<aside>“Both of my grandparents impressed upon me their conviction that we each have the capacity and the responsibility to work for a better and more just society.”</aside>\n<p>By the early 2000s, Harris was an up-and-coming lawyer in the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office working on child abuse and domestic violence crimes. Lateefah Simon was the executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.youngwomenfree.org/who-we-are.html\">Center for Young Women’s Development</a>, where the onetime single teen mom, then in her 20s, spent her days organizing young sex workers. The two formed an unlikely alliance. Simon was in the trenches confronting pimps; Harris was building cases against pimps and others involved in sex trafficking. Simon began accompanying Harris to “know your rights” sessions for women across the city, toting flip charts and an easel in the back of what Simon describes as Harris’ “beat-up BMW.”During her second year at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzJuB9Qe0H8&t=514s\">her mom and some other family members asked</a> what she would do “for the fight for justice” upon graduation. When Harris excitedly told them that she would become a prosecutor—she’d spent a summer interning at the Alameda County DA’s office in Oakland—she wound up having to defend the decision “like one would a thesis,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzJuB9Qe0H8&t=514s\">she recalled to Katie Couric</a>. At that point, only <a href=\"http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Pokorak.pdf\">5 percent of the state’s district attorneys</a> were nonwhite. But <a href=\"http://www.podcast.cnn.com/the-axe-files-david-axelrod/episode/all/1wYcAZTsIT7yl2/2muy1v.html\">as she once told</a> former Obama chief strategist David Axelrod, “When you want to improve a system, certainly there is a role to be played about marching and about banging down the door and sometimes on a bended knee. There is also a role, which is to be at the table where the decisions are made and influence the system from that perch, and that’s what I decided to do.”</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ap_04010804101.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-544160\" height=\"713\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Harris, right, receives the oath of office from California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald M. George, left, during inauguration ceremonies, Jan. 8, 2004. Harris’ mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, holds a copy of “The Bill of Rights.” </span></p>\n<p><span>George Nikitin/AP</span>\n<p>In 2004, after Harris <a href=\"http://sfgov.org/elections/results-summary-dec-2003\">defeated two-term incumbent Terence Hallinan</a> to become San Francisco’s district attorney—the first woman and the first person of color to hold the position—she approached Simon about joining that office.</p>\n<p>“I never wanted to work for The Man,” Simon says. “And she was like, ‘You’d be working for this black woman.'” When Simon demurred, Harris made her case more plainly: “You can bring your advocacy into the office, but do you forever want to be on the stairs yelling and begging for people to support you, your cause? Why can’t you fix it from the inside?”</p>\n<p>It was as much a plea as a rallying cry. By then Harris was already formulating her specific brand of fix-it-from-the-inside activism, and one program she created as district attorney would come to embody it: Back on Track.</p>\n<p>At the time, California led the nation in tough-on-crime legislation <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/20142.htm\">like three-strikes laws</a>. As a prosecutor in communities like Oakland and Richmond in the early ’90s, Harris had had a front-row seat to the carnage the crack cocaine epidemic wrought on African American communities. “She [was] very clear that the war on drugs [was] an abject failure,” says Tim Silard, an advocate for civil rights and income equality whom Harris tapped to help run Back on Track. As Harris would later write of her time in the DA’s office, some 60 percent of the new felony cases annually were nonviolent drug crimes. “Many of the perpetrators are repeat offenders who commit a crime days after being released from jail or prison for the previous crime,” she explains in <em>Smart on Crime</em>.</p>\n<aside>“You can bring your advocacy into the office, but do you forever want to be on the stairs yelling and begging for people to support you, your cause? Why can’t you fix it from the inside?”</aside>\n<p>Harris saw this as both a vicious cycle and a drain on resources. “Each one involves an arrest, a booking, a prosecutor’s time, a judge’s time, often a public defender’s time, a stay in jail of short or long duration, and a probation officer’s time, for which taxpayers foot the bill,” she writes in her book. “These crimes carry all sorts of collateral and psychic costs as well—the social damage of a neighborhood from drug dealing or the cost of putting an offender’s children in foster care.”</p>\n<p>So she <a href=\"https://www.bja.gov/Publications/backontrackfs.pdf\">set out to build a program for people</a> who, if reached in time, were less likely to reoffend: first-time nonviolent drug offenders, specifically those aged 18 to 30. If these offenders pleaded guilty, they could join a 12- to 18-month program of individualized support, which included job training, more than 200 hours of community service, and a requirement to find steady employment or enroll in school. It leaned heavily on public-private partnerships to create job and support services. The DA’s office reserved the right to jail participants if they broke any of the rules—even missing appointments—or were charged with another crime. At the end, there was a graduation at which a judge, who typically volunteered his or her time, would expunge the felony charge from the participant’s record.</p>\n<p>Back then, this approach was revolutionary. “I remember looking for analogues,” Michael Troncoso, who served as assistant district attorney and assistant chief attorney for policy under Harris in the DA’s office, says about Back on Track. “It was a lonely space to be in at the time.”</p>\n<p>Simon remembers brainstorming sessions in which the small team brought their legal pads and best ideas for what could make the program succeed. Harris insisted that some meetings with participants be held at the University of California’s law school instead of at the Hall of Justice—a hulking gray building attached to the county jail. “You don’t do programs to increase people’s options and life outcomes,” Simon says, by having them “come to the probation department to talk about what their dreams are.”</p>\n<p>Harris opened up her Rolodex to find opportunities for participants. Simon remembers her reaching out to the Department of Public Works to ask it to hire people from the program. She talked 24 Hour Fitness into offering free yearlong memberships and even convinced the Art Institute of California-San Francisco to create scholarships for qualified participants. She persuaded public servants to volunteer overseeing hearings for those in the program. Harris, Silard says, “proselytized the hell out of [Back on Track].”</p>\n<p>And it worked. While San Francisco’s <a href=\"http://sfpublicdefender.org/about/jeff-adachi/\">longtime Public Defender</a> Jeff Adachi says the program’s results are somewhat skewed because it targeted a small number of people—less than two dozen in most graduating classes—who “were seen as those most likely to succeed,” the statistics are hard to argue with. Back on Track had <a href=\"http://sfpublicdefender.org/about/jeff-adachi/\">a reoffense rate of 10 percent</a>, compared with rates of more than 50 percent among similar populations elsewhere in California.</p>\n<p><span>For Harris, the </span>program<strong> </strong>wasn’t just aimed at getting participants on their feet: It was also about building a team of activists within the criminal justice system, and persuading people who had spent time agitating from the outside to buy into making change from the inside. More often than not, that meant recruiting strong-willed women of color.</p>\n<p>Joanna Hernandez, then a young Latina organizer, had spent her career doing on-the-ground mediation with at-risk and gang-involved youths. When Simon tried to hire her as a reentry manager for Back on Track, Hernandez saw the district attorney’s office as an enemy, not an ally. Hernandez remembers saying, “What do I look like working with the DA’s office?” She had her own ideas of how the system operated: “Prosecution, wrongful prosecutions,” she says. But like her boss, Simon was persistent, and Hernandez eventually joined up.</p>\n<aside>“A lot of young people don’t get those second chances anymore, and to be part of a historic program that offers that was empowering for me.”</aside>\n<p>Hernandez considers her time with Back on Track as the key to finding effective ways to help some of the city’s most vulnerable. “A lot of young people don’t get those second chances anymore, and to be part of a historic program that offers that was empowering for me,” she says. “Especially seeing young people who grew up in the same neighborhood that I came from.”</p>\n<p>Harris was an exacting boss. Staffers were expected to keep their offices clean, return calls promptly, and respond to emails immediately. Harris required Simon, who did not have a college degree when she started working for the DA’s office, to get one. Simon enrolled at nearby Mills College and Harris demanded to inspect her report cards.</p>\n<p>Early on, when Simon showed up to a training in the city’s then predominantly black Bayview neighborhood wearing jeans and a hoodie, Harris took her aside. “Why would you ever disrespect your people? You work for this office. You work for the state, so you represent. Would you go to Pacific Heights”—one of the city’s whitest and wealthiest neighborhoods—”wearing that?” Simon recalls Harris saying. Later, Harris gave Simon a crash course on how to show up in a room, or what she called “executive presence.” When she was finished, she handed Simon a bag. In it was a brand new suit. It was Simon’s first, and it still hangs in her closet.</p>\n<p>Today, Simon, who won a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2003 for her work organizing formerly incarcerated young women of color, is president of the <a href=\"https://akonadi.org/akonadi/mission-values/\">Akonadi Foundation</a>, a racial justice organization, and serves on the <a href=\"https://www.bart.gov/about/bod/bodMembersDetail_07\">board of directors of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system</a>. She ran for that office <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/democracyincolor/lateefah-simon\">in the name of Oscar Grant</a>, the young black man who was <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/BART-Officer-Johannes-Mehserle-to-Take-Stand-in-Oscar-Grant-Civil-Trial-262692861.html\">killed by a BART officer on New Year’s Day in 2009</a>. She credits her current position to her work with Harris: “She saw me before I saw myself, in a lot of ways.”</p>\n<p><span>Back on Track </span>was an important win for Harris, who by 2009 was already eyeing statewide office. California was struggling with prison overcrowding, so Harris worked with the state Legislature and the Republican governor to get Back on Track <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB750\">signed into law as the model reentry program for the state</a>. That positioned her for <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/25/local/la-me-cooley-20101125\">the attorney general’s office in 2011</a>—and for the period when the conflicts baked into her fix-it-from-the-inside approach would erupt into full public view.</p>\n<p>As district attorney, Harris had passionately argued that a man convicted of killing a cop shouldn’t face the death penalty because of its well-documented racial disparities. The move won some of her earliest national press coverage. But police unions denounced her, and during her first run for attorney general she appeared to align herself more closely with them by remaining conspicuously silent on hotly contested criminal justice issues, like <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article74792387.html\">Gov. Jerry Brown’s “realignment”</a> that sent low-level offenders to county jails instead of state prisons. And then, as the state’s top law enforcement officer, after a federal court ruled that California’s enforcement of the death penalty was unconstitutional, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-death-penalty-appeal-20140821-story.html\">Harris appealed</a>, arguing that the ruling “undermines important protections that our courts provide to defendants.”</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ap_392918700081.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-544173\" height=\"640\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Left to right: Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones, California Attorney. Gen. Kamala Harris, Los Angeles County Sheriff, Jim McDonnell, and Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck.</span></p>\n<p> <span>Damian Dovarganes/AP</span>\n<p>Harris’ time as attorney general also coincided with what, on its face, would seem like a positive development for her political career: Criminal justice reform had become a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/opinion/kamala-harris-and-rand-paul-lets-reform-bail.html\">widely accepted, bipartisan issue</a>. The public awakening also made room for heightened scrutiny of police killings of black men and women in politically vulnerable communities. Scores of black activists called for accountability, but Harris mostly remained silent. While <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-senate-endorsement-20161006-snap-story.html\">the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> endorsed Harris</a> in her campaign for senator, it also wrote, “Harris has said California needs bold leadership, but a bold leader can’t sit out on significant decisions.”</p>\n<p>Whether Harris is politically deft enough to navigate the defining tensions of her party remains to be seen. But I observed one way she might do so, in an overflow room of the Hart Senate Office Building in September. I was there with Bernie Sanders supporters watching on a small television <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?433998-1/senator-sanders-unveils-medicare-bill\">as the Vermont senator introduced</a> his “Medicare for all” bill. One middle-aged white man wearing tan cargo shorts and carrying a Bernie 2016 sign lingered close to the TV. <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/17-senators-introduce-medicare-for-all-act\">Harris was one of 17 Democratic senators</a> who had signed on to the bill—including nearly all the buzzed-about 2020 hopefuls, from Elizabeth Warren to Cory Booker. When it was her turn to take the podium, Harris opened with platitudes—health care shouldn’t be partisan, people should receive it regardless of where they live or what they earn—that coming from a more firebrand politician might have earned applause. The Bernie supporters seemed unimpressed.</p>\n<p>But then Harris’ face lit up, her eyes grew wide, and her hands became animated as the economics major in her took over; you could almost see the flip charts turning in her head. The private sector, she said, often gauges what’s working and what’s not by looking at the return on investment. “The taxpayers of the United States deserve a better return on their investment,” she exclaimed to the crowd, which had finally started to cheer. She was hitting her stride, and at least that afternoon next to Sanders, she had started to bridge the divide she has so long tried to straddle. Even the man in the overflow room with the Bernie sign was nodding his head yes, seemingly buying into her argument—and into her.</p></figcaption></figure></figcaption></figure>",

And if you’re wondering what kind of TV Trump watches during Executive Time, wonder no more. Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/05/trump-media-feedback-loop-216248\">monitoring Trump’s tweets in order to figure this out:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Everyone has a theory about Trump’s hyperaggressive early morning tweetstorms. Some think they are a deliberate ploy the president uses to distract the press from his administration’s potential weaknesses, or to frame the public debate to his liking….But my many hours following the president’s tweets for <em>Media Matters for America</em>, the progressive media watchdog organization, have convinced me the truth is often much simpler: <strong>The president is just live-tweeting Fox, particularly the network’s Trump-loving morning show, <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>.</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_fox_friends1.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-544412\" height=\"557\"></figure>\n<p>….After comparing the president’s tweets with Fox’s coverage every day since October, <strong>I can tell you that the Fox-Trump feedback loop is happening far more often than you think.</strong> There is no strategy to Trump’s Twitter feed; he is not trying to distract the media. He is being distracted. He darts with quark-like speed¹ from topic to topic in his tweets because that’s how cable news works.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So how does all this play out in the real world? Evan Osnos, a longtime observer of China’s leadership, describes their conclusions <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/making-china-great-again\">after their meetings with Trump last year:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>During the Mar-a-Lago meetings, Chinese officials noticed that, <strong>on some of China’s most sensitive issues, Trump did not know enough to push back</strong>….[Daniel] Russel spoke to Chinese officials after the Mar-a-Lago visit. “The Chinese felt like they had Trump’s number….<strong>Fundamentally, what they said was ‘He’s a paper tiger.’</strong> Because he hasn’t delivered on any of his threats. There’s no wall on Mexico. There’s no repeal of health care. He can’t get the Congress to back him up. He’s under investigation.”</p>\n<p>….After the summit, the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing think tank, published an analysis of the Trump Administration, <strong>describing it as a den of warring “cliques,” the most influential of which was the “Trump family clan.”</strong> The Trump clan appears to “directly influence final decisions” on business and diplomacy in a way that “has rarely been seen in the political history of the United States,” the analyst wrote. He summed it up using an obscure phrase from feudal China: <em>jiatianxia</em>—“to treat the state as your possession.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the Chinese use the same kind of language to describe the Trump administration that we might use to describe a third-world thugocracy. Ultimately, though, the Chinese figure that’s fine, since it means they can do pretty much anything they like without having to worry about pushback from the former most powerful country in the world. China apparently views the Trump presidency as a huge opportunity for them to spread their influence around the globe unimpeded.</p>\n<p>¹Quark-like speed? Wut?</p>",

And it <em>did</em> destroy a bunch of records at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Joplin, Missouri, where Robert Weaver says he worked. And Weaver <em>did</em> work there. That much isn’t in doubt—though it’s not clear why a tornado that hit the hospital in Joplin also destroyed Weaver’s personal copies of his employment records. Just bad luck, I guess.</p>\n<p>However, that’s the good news. The rest, via the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, is…<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-nominee-to-lead-indian-health-services-faces-claims-of-misrepresentation-1515170335\">not so good:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the troubled Indian Health Service <strong>appears to have misrepresented his work experience at a Missouri hospital</strong> to a Senate committee, according to former employees at the hospital….<strong>“I don’t recall that name whatsoever,”</strong> said Augusto Noronha….<strong>“I’ve never heard that name before,”</strong> said Wayne Noethe….Rhonda Foust, who worked in finance at the Joplin hospital from 1981 to 2010, said she doesn’t recall crossing paths with Mr. Weaver….Jane Obert, a longtime manager who served as compliance officer among other jobs from 1992 to 2008, said that his name didn’t ring a bell to her….Diane Sadler, an accounting manager at the hospital from 1993 until 2010, said she worked “side by side with accounts receivable” and never met Mr. Weaver.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wait a second. Didn’t I say that Weaver really did work at this hospital? Yes I did:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Another former executive, Bob Henderson, who was director of patient financial services, said he recalled a subordinate named Rob Weaver <strong>who registered E.R. patients, gathered insurance information and collected copays,</strong> and who eventually supervised a few other patient-registration workers….He said he didn’t recall Mr. Weaver ever overseeing accounts receivable or working in budgeting or physician recruitment, or regularly participating in the leadership meetings while working under his chain of command.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to other hospital officials, Weaver’s position was an entry-level job. But by the time this got typed up as a resume, Weaver’s experience included “various hospital administration positions, including managing all accounts receivable, budgets, patient access and physician recruitment.” This is like one of those parody career advice books, where registering ER intake becomes “patient access” and collecting copays becomes “managing accounts receivable.”</p>\n<p>And yet, believe it or not, this <em>still</em> isn’t the best part of the story. Several of Weaver’s defenders said that he had “worked with” the Indian Health Service for two decades:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Asked by the <em>Journal</em> what constituted his IHS experience, <strong>the spokeswoman said he had needed the system as a patient, especially when he was a child,</strong> and pointed to his career in health care.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I dunno. Maybe Weaver’s experience in later life makes him eminently qualified to run a $6 billion federal agency. That’s certainly what the Trump administration thinks. An HHS spokeswoman told the <em>Journal</em> that “any suggestion Mr. Weaver is unqualified to run IHS is a pure act of character assassination.”</p>\n<p>Sure. Whatever. He sounds better qualified than <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/heck-job-brownie-where-disgraced-fema-head-now-n400436\">Michael “heckuva job” Brown,</a> anyway.</p>",

But now, those warning calls have reached a full-scale alarm, leaving researchers at a loss for exactly how best to save the reefs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/80\">A study published Thursday in <em>Science</em></a> by some of the world’s top coral experts amounts to a last rites for the ecosystems often referred to as <a href=\"https://rainforests.mongabay.com/09reefs.htm\">“the tropical rainforests of the sea.”</a> Scientists surveyed 100 reefs around the world and found that extreme bleaching events that once occurred every 25 or 30 years now happen about every five or six years.</p>\n<p>With the time transpiring between bleaching events shortened by a factor of five, there isn’t adequate time for the ecosystems to recover. Even the fastest-growing corals that survive a major bleaching event need about 10 years to regain their health. These damaging events are now occurring more quickly virtually eliminates any serious chance of large-scale recovery on a global scale. Huge portions of the world’s reefs face almost certain death—and that loss will reverberate beyond earth’s oceans.</p>\n<p>Bleaching happens when corals become overheated and expel the symbiotic algae that feed them. Without the algae to photosynthesize their food for them, corals stop growing and become more susceptible to disease. If water temperatures remain too high for too long, the corals can die.</p>\n<aside>“These impacts are stacking up at a pace and at a severity that I never had anticipated, even as an expert.”</aside>\n<p>“These impacts are stacking up at a pace and at a severity that I never had anticipated, even as an expert,” says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and coral researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “It’s really the rapidity of it that is so sobering and shocking—and for me personally, life-altering.”</p>\n<p>Cobb, who is not affiliated with the new study, had first-hand experience with the latest and most severe instance of global coral bleaching: a three-year event that hit almost every major reef system in the world and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/science/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff.html\">eventually decimated portions of the Great Barrier Reef.</a> In 2016, around the height of the bleaching, she made a series of dives off remote Kiritimati Island, due south of Hawaii. There, Cobb watched in horror as roughly 80 percent of one of the most pristine coral ecosystems in the world died in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>“Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of,” Terry Hughes, a coral scientist at Australia’s James Cook University and lead author of the new study, <a href=\"https://www.coralcoe.org.au/media-releases/the-window-for-saving-the-worlds-coral-reefs-is-rapidly-closing\">said in a statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Hughes <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/inside-look-at-catastrophic-bleaching-of-the-great-barrier-reef-2017-hughes\">personally surveyed</a> thousands of miles of the Great Barrier Reef during the 2015 and 2016 bleaching. “It broke my heart,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/15/stopping-global-warming-is-only-way-to-save-great-barrier-reef-scientists-warn\">he told the Guardian</a> last year.</p>\n<p>The new study finds that 94 percent of surveyed coral reefs have experienced a severe bleaching event since the 1980s. Only six sites surveyed were unaffected. They are scattered around the world, meaning no ocean basin on Earth has been entirely spared.</p>\n<p>The implications of these data in a warming world, taken together with other ongoing marine stressors like overfishing and pollution, are damning.</p>\n<p>“It is clear already that we’re going to lose most of the world’s coral reefs,” says study coauthor Mark Eakin, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch program. He adds that by 2050, ocean temperatures will be warm enough to cause annual bleaching of 90 percent of the world’s reefs.</p>\n<aside>“It is clear already that we’re going to lose most of the world’s coral reefs.”</aside>\n<p>For conservation biologists like Josh Drew, whose work focuses on coral reefs near Fiji, that loss of recovery time amounts to a “death warrant for coral reefs as we know them.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not saying we’re not going to have reefs at all, but those reefs that survive are going to be fundamentally different,” says Drew, who is not affiliated with the new study. “We are selecting for corals that are effectively weedy, for things that can grow back in two to three years, for things that are accustomed to having hot water.”</p>\n<p>Reefs are incalculably important not only as a harbor for life—they shelter about one-quarter of all marine species in just a half-percent of the ocean’s surface area —but also for human nutrition and many nation’s economies. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide depend on reef species as a primary protein source, and tourists bring tens of billions of dollars to coastal regions and island chains each year to get a peek at the underwater ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Researchers are struggling to think about what the loss of such an integral part of the Earth might mean in the decades ahead. And scientists, like NOAA’s Eakin, have changed their outlooks on the scale of action that’s necessary to save the world’s coral reefs.</p>\n<p>“We need to be looking at much more radical actions to preserve those reefs that we still can preserve,” he says.</p>\n<p>In the best case, some researchers point to extreme measures like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/blueprint-engineering-super-coral-180964309/\">genetically modifying super corals</a> to withstand increased temperatures, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2655?WT.feed_name=subjects_marine-biology\">removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150525120430.htm\">geoengineering</a> as the only remaining options for saving corals at a large scale. Another approach involves identifying the few dozen reefs around the world most likely to survive and instituting <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-24/50-reefs-first-global-plan-says-only-10-pc-reefs-can-be-saved/8293514\">crash-conservation methods</a> to transform each one into a kind of seed bank for future generations after climate change has stabilized.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, each of these ideas is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/profterryhughes/status/835431356528107520?lang=en\">highly controversial</a>. But increasingly, coral researchers are willing to support a kind of “all-of-the-above” strategy, to avoid the worst case—losing corals entirely.</p>\n<p>“It’s scary to think of what the oceans might look like once we degrade reefs as much as they’re likely to degrade in the next 50 years,” says Georgia Tech’s Cobb. “It will be so profoundly reshaped that it’s kind of a scientific no-man’s land.”</p>\n<p>If there’s one consensus among the coral community, it’s that this is unequivocally the last call for saving the reefs. It’s truly an all-hands-on-deck moment.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have the hubris—and none of us have the data—to say what strategy will work and what won’t,” Cobb says. “What is categorically unacceptable for me is to not try.”</p>",

Here’s an example. On Wednesday the Interior Department announced that it would open up nearly the entire outer continental shelf for oil and gas drilling. That’s bad. But actually getting oil platforms up and running takes more than just an announcement. Here on the West Coast, for example, the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington have all announced that they will do “whatever it takes” to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-california-offshore-drilling-20180106-story.html\">stop it from happening:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>There are myriad obstacles opponents can throw in front of the proposal,</strong> not to mention questions about whether the oil industry has much of an interest in California’s offshore reserves at a time when domestic oil production is at its highest level in decades.</p>\n<p>….In California, <strong>the state coastal commission also has the authority to review activities in federal waters</strong> to ensure they are consistent with the state’s coastal management plans….While the U.S. Secretary of Commerce could override a commission finding that new oil drilling violated the state’s management plan, federal courts have tended to side with states in such contests.</p>\n<p>And California has another weapon: State Lands Commission jurisdiction over tidelands and waters that extend roughly three miles offshore. <strong>That gives the commission the ability to stop the construction of pipelines that are the most economical way of transporting oil and gas from offshore rigs to land.</strong> “In some ways that is an even more formidable tool that the state of California and like-minded local governments can utilize to deny approval of things like oil terminals and pipelines crossing state sovereign tidelands,” said Richard Frank, director of the California Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center at UC Davis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Needless to say, the mere fact that building drilling platforms would touch off a legal war is something that will cause oil companies to think hard before they spend money on leases.</p>\n<p>There’s no question that it’s genuinely bizarre to have a presidency that seems to be literally driven by a desire for revenge on Barack Obama because he made fun of Donald Trump at a dinner a few years ago. In one sense that makes Trump more dangerous than a normal president, but the very fact of Trump’s derangement has also spawned a far more energized opposition movement than a normal presidency might have. That’s why Trump doesn’t have his wall. Or his immigration restrictions. Or the repeal of Obamacare. Or the end of financial regulations. On one side, he has a Democratic Party implacably opposed to everything he does, and on the other he has a rejuvenated liberal movement determined to tie him up in court forever. This doesn’t mean Trump will do no damage. He’ll do plenty. But in the end, I suspect it will be less than we fear. There’s a real limit to how far even an unhinged political party and a monomaniacal president can buck public opinion.</p>",

Parents and teachers shared images of kids <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/us/baltimore-schools-cold/index.html\">bundled</a> in coats and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/friendsofpatterson/posts/138097883546298\">thermostats</a> on social media. </p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"550\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This.Is.Unacceptable. <a href=\"https://t.co/1WKTV2g63o\">pic.twitter.com/1WKTV2g63o</a></p>\n<p>— Aaron Maybin (@AaronMMaybin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronMMaybin/status/948632894699921409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Wednesday, after the district closed four schools and dismissed two others early, Baltimore City Public Schools CEO Sonja Santelises <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/baltcityschools/videos/1525204744260305/\">said</a> in a Facebook video that 60 school buildings—a third of the district—reported problems that included broken boilers and water pipes. The decision to close schools, though, wasn’t made lightly. Santelises noted in the video that in the district, where nearly 87 percent of students are eligible for free and reduced lunch, administrators were forced to try to find a balance between the students’ need for food and safety with an impossibly cold learning environment. </p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for local politicians to start sparring over the issue: On Thursday, when Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boydkrutherford/status/948604112681259010\">tweeted</a> that if his kids were in Baltimore’s schools, he would be at the superintendent’s office “seeking answers,” former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a Democratic candidate for Maryland governor, shot back, replying that “all Maryland kids” are Rutherford’s kids. “Will we see you at the Superintendent’s office seeking answers for your kids?” he tweeted. Jealous <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/benjealous/photos/a.10152061363274436.1073741828.14960614435/10155403394354436/?type=3&theater\">wrote</a> later on Facebook that Rutherford didn’t show up, adding: “Had he, I would have told him our administrators and teachers are not to blame and that it’s time we fully fund our schools.” </p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"550\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When do you want to go?</p>\n<p>— Boyd Rutherford (@BoydKRutherford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoydKRutherford/status/948949470821089290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><del></del>In a statement to <em>CNN</em>, Santelises expressed frustration with the lack of funding for school infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“[T]oo many of our buildings have outdated heating systems, poor insulation, and aging pipes as a result of years of inadequate funding for maintenance and facilities improvements,” she said. In an <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/why-baltimore-teachers-wanted-schools-to-close-heat-infrastructure-challenges\">op-ed</a> for <em>Teen Vogue</em>, Kimberly Mooney, a teacher in Baltimore, also argued that the schools’ faltering pipes were just one example of the minimal financial support from the state to resolve Baltimore’s “crumbling infrastructure.” </p>\n<p>In 2012, a report commissioned by Baltimore City Public Schools <a href=\"http://www.baltimorecityschools.org/cms/lib/MD01001351/Centricity/domain/8049/2011_12_archives/JacobsPressRelease_6_26_12.pdf\">found</a> that 69 percent of the district’s campuses were in “very poor condition,” and it would take an estimated $2.5 billion to bring buildings up to adequate standards. <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/bs-md-ci-schools-money-returned-20180104-story.html\">reported</a> on Thursday that the city’s schools have had to return $66 million in state funding to fix heating systems and make building repairs after they delayed projects for too long or the projects became too costly. Lawmakers <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-schools-update-20180105-story.html\">called</a> for changes to how money was awarded for projects,  and Maryland’s Gov. Larry Hogan <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-schools-update-20180105-story.html\">said</a> he was “outraged at the failures in Baltimore City” and blasted officials’ “ineptness and mismanagement” regarding the funding.   </p>\n<p>The debate in Baltimore reflects longstanding infrastructure woes schools face throughout the country. Beyond roads and highways, these 100,000 public schools—many of which are housed by aging buildings in desperate need of repairs and modernization—make up the second largest infrastructure system in the United States. Yet the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) <a href=\"https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Schools-Final.pdf\">concluded in its annual report card</a> last year that more than half of the nation’s public schools needed investments just to bring the building conditions to “good.” High-quality school facilities have been linked to better <a href=\"https://www.the74million.org/article/the-detroit-sick-out-makes-a-valid-point-crumbling-schools-have-been-shown-to-hurt-learning/\">academic achievement</a> for students, <a href=\"https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/fa/re/documents/learnercenter.pdf\">fewer suspensions</a>, and better staff retention. </p>\n<p>The problem has been brewing for decades. The Government Accountability Office <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/HEHS-95-61\">concluded</a> in 1995 that America’s schools needed a collective $112 billion to “repair or upgrade their facilities to good condition.” That number has ballooned to an estimated $145 billion per year, including an additional $46 billion each year on construction and maintenance to bring facilities up to modern standards, <a href=\"https://kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/published/56f02c3d626415b792000008/2016-state-of-our-schools-report.pdf?kui=wo7vkgV0wW0LGSjxek0N5A\">according</a> to a 2016 “State of Our Schools” report.</p>\n<p>Currently, the federal government <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/its-time-for-states-to-invest-in-infrastructure\">spends</a> little on improving school infrastructure, leaving the bulk of the financing to come from the state and local governments. In fact, local taxpayer dollars account for, on average, only 45 percent of funding toward maintenance and operations. But budgets are tight: After the 2008 recession, most states reduced school funding, putting pressure on local districts to make up the difference. In 2015, 29 states still had less overall state funding than they did in the 2008 school year, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-punishing-decade-for-school-funding\">according</a> to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, even as student enrollment grew.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the capital funds, which are used to renovate and build new schools and to shore up technological infrastructure, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-punishing-decade-for-school-funding\">dropped</a> 31 percent from 2008 to 2015. The ASCE 2017 report card <a href=\"https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Schools-Final.pdf\">noted</a> that the constricted budgets have led to “accelerating deterioration of heating, cooling, and lighting systems.”  And much of the capital construction investment on school facilities—82 percent—comes down to how much school districts can raise from taxpayers, the 2016 “State of Our Schools” joint report <a href=\"https://kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/published/56f02c3d626415b792000008/2016-state-of-our-schools-report.pdf?kui=wo7vkgV0wW0LGSjxek0N5A\">noted</a>. “Because the large majority of capital construction is funded by local taxpayers, the ability of school districts to pay for major renewals or new construction is tied to the wealth of their community, perpetuating inequity in school facility conditions,” the authors wrote.  </p>\n<p>One 2006 study <a href=\"http://www.21csf.org/best-home/docuploads/pub/100_GandDReportFinal-UpdatedVersion3-10-08.pdf\">found</a> that projects at schools in wealthier areas spent three times more capital funds than projects in schools in poorer areas—where infrastructure investment is needed the most. In the 2012-2013 school year, 60 percent of schools with some of the poorest student populations, where more than 75 percent of students qualify for free and reduced lunch, needed repairs. That’s 12 percentage points higher than those in wealthier communities, according to the<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014022.pdf\">National Education Center for Statistics. </a></p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether President Donald Trump, with his long<strong>–</strong>promised $1 trillion infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/trump-is-said-to-ready-infrastructure-plan-for-january-release\">plan</a>, will keep his pledge to “rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.” Last January, Senate Democrats <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-set-to-unveil-a-trump-style-infrastructure-plan/2017/01/23/332be2dc-e1b3-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html?utm_term=.895a248862e0\">introduced</a> their own 10-year infrastructure proposal that included $75 billion toward shoring up schools, and it’s been lying dormant in Congress ever since. For now, some citizens are taking action—a college student’s GoFundMe <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/we-need-heat-in-our-public-schools\">campaign</a> to provide space heaters and jackets for the Baltimore<strong> </strong>students far exceeded its $20,000 goal.  </p>",

David Atkins says <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/2018/01/06/the-fbi-is-cracking-under-pressure-and-time-is-running-out/\">things changed this week:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>In the year since Donald Trump moved into the White House, one of the key questions was how long the institutions of American democracy would hold up if he tried to create an authoritarian state centered around himself. <strong>For a long time things seemed to be largely OK:</strong> the institutions of state were mostly able to resist Trump’s incursions into their necessary roles and perform their duties more or less as intended.</p>\n<p>….<strong>But all of that started to change this week</strong>….Republican Senators who began last year by pretending to want investigations into Russia’s interference in the election are now actively scuttling those investigations. Two Republican Senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham, have now made a criminal referral to the FBI against [Christopher] Steele, the longtime intelligence officer who provided information designed to expose Russia’s crimes and accomplices….Meanwhile, reports surfaced <strong>the FBI wilted some months ago after ongoing public pressure from Donald Trump to prosecute his political opponents for nonexistent crimes</strong> by reopening investigations into the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One nothingburger.</p>\n<p>….On the <em>real</em> collusion front, the integrity of the FBI’s investigation in Trump and his associates is being hampered by Intelligence Committee Chairman <strong>Devin Nunes’ blatant attempts to acquire sensitive documents held close by the FBI,</strong> and to subpoena FBI officials whose public testimony would harm the investigation itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I mentioned the other day, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/01/im-just-a-big-ol-optimist-about-the-future-of-america-under-donald-trump/\">I’m in non-panic mode right now.</a> Still, there’s no question that things are getting worse. Republicans <em>are</em> in panic mode over the possibility that Robert Mueller is about to start plowing relentlessly through the White House like a bulldozer leveling an old shack. By the time he’s through, they’re understandably afraid there might not be much left standing.</p>\n<p>At the risk of being too Pollyannaish, it’s almost good news that Republicans are acting this way. It means they realize their party is in existential trouble.</p>\n<p>This is one of the paradoxes at the heart of my relative calm about the future of America. On a nationwide level, I consider the election of Donald Trump to be a fluke: he was running against a party that had been in power for eight years; he got a last-minute tailwind out of the blue from James Comey; and then his 2 million+ loss in the popular vote turned into a quirky, razor-thin Electoral College win.</p>\n<p>But at the level of the Republican Party, there was nothing flukish about it. Trump led the primary race from the start. He serially demolished a field that would normally have been considered pretty strong. And he did it despite the almost unanimous opposition of party regulars. Trump very plainly tapped into something very real in the Republican rank-and-file psyche.</p>\n<p>My take on this is pretty simple. For years it’s been obvious that Republicans are the party of whites and Democrats are the party of nonwhites. This worked fine for a while, but starting in the 90s it became an increasingly weighty albatross and Republicans became increasingly desperate to increase both white turnout and their share of the white vote. Fox News helped with this. Karl Rove’s focus on the “missing evangelicals” helped. Gerrymandering helped. Pack and crack helped. Photo ID laws helped. But these were just pellets in a war dominated by a <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx\">disastrous decline in party ID in the Bush years</a> that the party never recovered from.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_republican_id_2004_2018.gif\" class=\"wp-image-544362\" height=\"540\"></figure>\n<p>For a while this worked, though Republicans have won the popular vote for the presidency only once in the past quarter century. By 2012, however, they had run out of new tricks to gain more white votes and suppress more nonwhite votes—and the nonwhite share of the population was still continuing its implacable rise. Party leaders understood perfectly well that this meant they needed better outreach to people of color, but this was something they could never pull off. Their only other option was to become even more explicitly unambiguous in their appeal to the white vote, and that never seemed like a plausible strategy: you might gain some working-class whites out of the deal, but you’d lose at least as many centrist whites who’d be disgusted by the all-but-open appeal to racism.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that this is what the Republican base wanted, which is why Trump won the nomination easily. Party leaders had no choice but to get aboard, but in the end Trump <em>did</em> lose more white votes than he gained. Compared to 2012, Trump gained among high school grads but lost votes among college grads. When the returns were in, not only did the white share of the overall vote continue its long decline, but Trump got a smaller share of that white vote than Romney.¹ Party leaders had been right: an outright appeal to white racial grievance did more harm than good.</p>\n<p>So here’s the situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Republican Party is screwed. Both their base and the conservative media-industrial complex are all-in on racial grievance-mongering, but it’s clear that this is a losing strategy nationwide that’s only going to get worse. The demographic argument for the GOP’s demise has been a Chicken Little prediction for years, but it’s pretty clear that the sky really is falling now.</li>\n<li>By a fluke, they won anyway in 2016.</li>\n<li>At the moment, it looks like they’re about to get squashed like bugs in the 2018 midterms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s really only one possible reaction to all this: panic. And that’s what we’re getting. Just as working-class whites are in a panic over their loss of status, Republicans are in a panic over their loss of numbers. Now, with their doom finally staring them in the face, Republicans are doing anything they can to put it off—and that’s unmasked some pretty despicable behavior.</p>\n<p>Once again, though, Republicans are stuck. If they act decently, they’ll lose their base. But the farther they go down the road of outrage and coverups, the more centrist votes they’ll lose. Virginia and Alabama are just the start. The Resistance is just the start. #BlackLivesMatter is just the start. What we’re seeing now is not the birth spasms of a new, authoritarian America. It’s more like the final bout of Cheyne-Stokes breathing before the death of the Republican Party.</p>\n<p>¹<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/race/president/#exit-polls\">In 2012,</a> whites made up 72 percent of the voting population and Romney won 59 percent of them. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls\">In 2016,</a> whites made up 71 percent of the voting population and Trump won 57 percent of them. Among the population as a whole, Trump gained 3 points among high school grads but lost 7 points among college grads.</p>",

        "content": "<p>With the new year, Republicans are eager to shut down probes of what President Trump has called “this Russia thing.” They are pressing to rapidly complete congressional inquiries into the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia while working to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation. </p>\n<p>For months, Republicans have pursued a strategy that boils down to: obstruct, divert, and undercut. They have stymied Democratic efforts to probe various Russia threads, mounted diversionary inquiries related to Hillary Clinton, and sought to kneecap the special counsel investigation by launching an attack on the credibility of the Justice Department itself. On Friday, two Republican Senators, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-01-04%20CEG%20LG%20to%20FBI%20DOJ%20(unclassified%20cover%20letter%20for%20classified%20S.._.pdf\">asked</a> the Justice Department to investigate whether former British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele, the author of a series of memos <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump/\">detailing</a> allegations regarding Trump and Russia, broke the law by lying to federal authorities about his contacts with reporters regarding his findings. The request <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/politics/trump-russia-senate-intel.html?_r=0\">marked</a> the first known congressional criminal referral related to the Trump-Russia scandal, and it targeted a figure known for exposing Trump’s Russia ties.</p>\n<aside>“They’re trying to shut us down,” Rep. Adam Schiff say<em>s</em>. “I think external pressure from the president and others is having an effect.” </aside>\n<p>With the midterm elections looming, Republicans in and out of Congress have pushed the notion that the inquiries have run their course and should be concluded early this year. The top Republicans on the House and Senate intelligence have signaled plans to wrap up their work as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“They want to try to start the New Year by giving Trump a clean slate,” says Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a member of the House intelligence committee. And Democrats charge that House Speaker Paul Ryan has personally pushed the House intelligence committee to conclude its Russia investigation. </p>\n<p>Democratic criticism has focused particularly on efforts by House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to impede the probe. Nunes stepped aside from his committee’s Russia investigation last April amid an ethics investigation into allegations he released classified information, but the panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, says the California Republican continued <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/trumps-congressional-allies-are-manipulating-the-steele-dossier-to-undercut-the-russia-investigation/\">meddling</a> in the probe, blocking interview and document requests. The ethics committee <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/intelligence-chairman-devin-nunes-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-house-ethics-probe/2017/12/07/b607b1e2-dba7-11e7-a841-2066faf731ef_story.html?utm_term=.e35c7c6170cc\">cleared</a> Nunes last month. But Democrats say he is not the whole problem. They argue that the Republicans who took charge of the investigation in his stead, Reps. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), and Thomas Rooney (R-Fla.), face pressure from Ryan to quickly end the inquiry.</p>\n<p>Speier, Schiff, and other Democrats argue that their Republican colleagues, in a bid to quickly conclude their work, are rushing through witnesses and blocking Democrats’ requests to interview an additional 30 people who may have information on the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia. Democrats note GOP members have refused to seek follow-up interviews with witnesses including Donald Trump Jr. and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/01/05/schiff-the-case-that-trump-obstructed-justice-just-got-stronger/?utm_term=.027fc5019304\">reported</a> that Schiff recently asked Republicans to seek an interview with Mark Corallo, a former spokesman for Trump’s legal team. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/axios-am-2522224225.html\">According</a> to a new book by Michael Wolff, Corallo quit over concerns that the president obstructed justice by dictating a false statement concerning the secret Trump Tower confab between Trump’s inner circle and a Russian lawyer, allegedly offering dirt on Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government. Schiff said Republicans refused his request. </p>\n<p>Republicans have said they plan to interview a few more high-profile witnesses, including Steve Bannon, Trump’s former campaign chief, who, according to Wolff’s book, called the Trump Tower meeting “treasonous.” House Republicans on Friday released statistics they say shows the committee’s probe has been thorough: 297,277 documents produced to the committee, 67 witness interviews conducted by members and staff behind closed doors, 18 subpoenas, and seven “countries visited questioning foreign intelligence services.” But the document appears aimed at supporting the conclusion that the investigation should now come to a close.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to shut us down,” Schiff tells <em>Mother Jones</em>. “I think external pressure from the president and others is having an effect. The buck stops with the Speaker.”</p>\n<p>AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, sidestepped questions about whether Ryan is pressing the committee to end its probe. But in a statement she notes the need for the panel to finalize its work quickly enough to issue recommendations well before this year’s midterm elections.</p>\n<p>“For nearly a year, the House review has been following the facts, and it continues to do so,” Strong says in the statement. “The investigation will conclude when the Committee has reached a conclusion. It’s clear by the endless political posturing by some House Democrats that they would like to see this investigation go on forever. Whether it concludes next month, next year, or in three years, they’ll say it’s too soon. It is also the Committee’s responsibility to provide recommendations to Congress to ensure what took place last election never happens again. The only responsible outcome would be to get those Committee recommendations in time to implement them before the election coming just this year.”</p>\n<p>Gowdy says that Ryan has asked him about the “time frame” for completing the probe. But he insists that he did not feel pressured by Ryan. “Paul has never once asked me to shut down an investigation,” Gowdy says, noting that he considered the end of 2017 “a natural boundary.” He says that Democrats hope to drag out the probe, which he claims has failed to reveal evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. (Gowdy <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/12/house-benghazi-committee-files-final-report-and-shuts-down/95336692/\">spent</a> more than two-and-a-half years investigating Benghazi as the chair of a House select committee scrutinizing this Clinton-related controversy.)</p>\n<p>“If Adam had his way, you and I would be having this conversation a year from now,” Gowdy says. Schiff’s list of witnesses is jammed with obscure Russian names, Gowdy claims. “Nobody knows what the hell he’s talking about,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Compared to the fractious House committee probe, the Senate intelligence committee’s Russia investigation has proceeded relatively smoothly. Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and top committee Democrat Mark Warner (D-Va.) regularly emphasize their cooperation. But their outward displays of collegiality barely conceal sharp differences over the investigation. For instance, Burr has resisted Democrats’ calls for public hearings, where witnesses including Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner would have to testify (or assert their Fifth Amendment rights).</p>\n<p>Burr has told reporters that he wants to complete his investigation early this year. While acknowledging last month that the probe would continue longer than he hoped, he <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/the-senates-russia-investigation-is-now-looking-into-jill?utm_term=.lbpemRvy0n#.ghJ8w2YpzW\">insisted</a> that “it’s not going to carry over far,” into 2018, unless new revelations create a need for additional witness interviews.</p>\n<p>Amid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949287555660500992\">pressure</a> from Trump for congressional committees to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/politics/trump-russia-senate-intel.html?_r=0\">drop</a> their investigations into his campaign’s Russia ties and look instead into alleged malfeasance by Hillary Clinton, Burr has seemed to shift in that direction. Despite his stated goal of quickly ending the probe, he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/politics/russia-intelligence-election-jill-stein-richard-burr/index.html\">told</a> reporters last month that in addition to investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia and a 2015 trip to Moscow by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, the committee was beginning to investigate another campaign. Burr declined to specify, but Senate aides acknowledged his obvious reference to the Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p>The committee has previously <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/25/senate-clinton-campaign-documents-russia-244177\">sought</a> emails from the Clinton campaign and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/26/politics/john-podesta-debbie-wasserman-schultz-trump-dossier/index.html\">interviewed</a> Democrats, including former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman. But Warner suggests in a statement to <em>Mother Jones</em> that the panel is not investigating Trump’s unsupported assertions that Clinton colluded with Russia but is instead questioning Democrats because they were victims of Russian hacking.</p>\n<p>“The Clinton campaign was the target of an unprecedented hacking and disinformation campaign,” Warner says. “Of course we would want to talk to anyone who can shed light on what happened in 2016.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Chuck Grassley, whose committee is also looking into Russian election interference, has not been coy about his efforts to investigate Clinton. In a Senate floor <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/american-people-deserve-whole-story-grassley-importance-congressional-oversight\">speech</a> last month, the Iowa Republican said that his committee should look into the Justice Department’s handling of the Trump-Russia investigation and the department’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. “The political reality is that half the country thinks that our law enforcement establishment gave Hillary Clinton and her aides a pass,” Grassley said. “These questions go to the heart of the integrity of our federal law enforcement and justice system. They are not going away just because Clinton lost the election.” </p>\n<p>Since October, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif), the committee’s top Democrat, has looked into the Trump-Russia scandal on her own. Feinstein has <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/the-senate-judiciary-committees-russia-probe-just-blew-up/\">said</a> she is proceeding without Grassley, and thus without subpoena power, because he insists on pairing each investigative step on Russia with a step to look into Clinton-related matters.</p>\n<p>While Republicans work to wind down the congressional Trump-Russia probes, they’re simultaneously ratcheting up pressure on the Justice Department, targeting officials they say have Democratic ties. Bruce Ohr, who previously served in the deputy attorney general’s office, was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/15/politics/senate-intel-bruce-ohr/index.html\">reportedly</a> demoted because his wife, Nellie, did research for Fusion GPS and because he met with one of the firm’s founders, Glenn Simpson, after the November 2016 election to discuss the Steele dossier. Andrew McCabe, deputy director of the FBI, is retiring after an onslaught of GOP attacks. Republicans, including Trump, have tried to paint the 20-year bureau veteran as a Clinton crony because when his wife ran for state senate in Virginia, her campaign received money from the state’s Democratic Party, which was headed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally. (Documents released Friday by the FBI state that McCabe had no conflict of interest in the Clinton email case.) Republicans have also attacked James Baker, the bureau’s top lawyer, who was seen as a Comey ally, with Trump himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F12%2F23%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fmccabe-fbi-trump-russia.html\">celebrating</a> reports that Baker was reassigned within the bureau.</p>\n<p>In a loosely veiled bid to undercut Mueller’s Russia probe, Republicans, including Grassley and House judiciary committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), have even pushed for the appointment of another special counsel to investigate the Justice Department’s handling of the Steele memos and the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/the-clinton-uranium-scandal-is-right-wing-nonsense-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Uranium One deal</a>—in which the State Department, while Clinton was secretary of state, joined other agencies in okaying the sale of a Canadian firm that owned uranium production facilities in the United States to a Russian-owned firm. GOP requests for a new special counsel appear to overlook details of the special counsel law. The statute requires a Justice Department finding that a criminal investigation is warranted and that the department cannot conduct the probe itself due to a conflict of interest. Justice Department officials have suggested the calls for a new special counsel do not meet those criteria.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Republican pressure on the Justice Department has yielded results. Since November, the Justice Department has been reviewing issues pushed by congressional Republicans. Justice Department prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/prosecutors-ask-fbi-agents-info-uranium-one-deal-n831436\">are </a><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/justice-department-looking-into-hillary-clintons-emails-again\">questioning</a> FBI agents about the Uranium One case, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/clinton-foundation-fbi.html\">the Clinton Foundation</a>, and the Clinton email investigation. Last month, Justice Department officials briefed House oversight committee staff about their review of Uranium One matter, according to committee aides. </p>\n<p>The agency in December <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/top-democrats-say-trumps-justice-department-helped-undermine-the-mueller-investigation/\">drew</a> the ire of Democrats for allowing select reporters to review texts exchanged by FBI staffers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who both worked previously as part of Mueller’s team. Republicans have seized on texts in which Strzok disparaged Trump. (The texts also criticized other politicians in both parties.)</p>\n<p>The texts, which Republicans say show anti-Trump bias, have fueled calls by some House Republicans for Trump to fire Mueller, even though Mueller removed Strzok from his team after learning of the messages. Republicans are also eyeing other means to kneecap Mueller. On Thursday, two Trump allies, Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rep-mark-meadows-its-time-for-jeff-sessions-to-go/article/2644934\">penned</a> an op-ed calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign due to his supposed failure to control the FBI. Sessions has <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/jeff-sessions-russia-recusing/\">recused</a> himself from all Justice Department activity related to the 2016 election, including the special counsel probe. His exit would open the door for Trump to nominate a new Justice Department boss who could curtail Mueller’s investigation.</p>",

Order 3360, signed by Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, explains that the policies were rescinded because they were “potential burdens” to energy development.</p>\n<p>The order echoes earlier mandates from President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to Interior’s 70,000 employees: Prioritize energy development and de-emphasize climate change and conservation. The order is another in a long string of examples of science and conservation taking a backseat to industry’s wishes at the Interior Department under Zinke.</p>\n<p><a data-linktype=\"external\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343673/3360-20-20Rescinding-20Authorities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-val=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343673/3360-20-20Rescinding-20Authorities.pdf\">The sweeping order, which Bernhardt signed Dec. 22.</a>, affects a department that manages a fifth of the nation’s land, 19 percent of U.S. energy supplies and most of the water in the 12 Western states. It fulfills a high-profile <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-promoting-energy-independence-economic-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> by Trump and a <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/so_3349_-american_energy_independence.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">secretarial order</a> from Zinke, both announced in March. Interior did not publicize the order but posted it on its website with other secretarial orders. The Interior Department refused to answer questions about order 3360 on Thursday. “Sorry, nobody is available for you,” Heather Swift, the department spokesperson, wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>Environmental groups were surprised that the agency failed to tout the policy decisions. “We’ve been waiting for it. We thought they would do it with some sort of great pride,” said <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://wilderness.org/bios/staff/nada-culver\" target=\"_blank\">Nada Culver</a>, who directs the Wilderness Society’s BLM action center.</p>\n<aside>“We’ve been waiting for it. We thought they would do it with some sort of great pride.”</aside>\n<p>The Bureau of Land Management last week did announce a related policy change that makes it easier for companies to develop oil and gas in core sage grouse habitats that were protected in 2015 as part of an <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/historic-conservation-campaign-protects-greater-sage-grouse\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented conservation initiative</a>. The BLM replaced six instructional memoranda that direct field staff on how to manage 67 million acres of prime sage grouse habitat across 10 Western states. Among other things, the new instructions relieve BLM staff from the requirement that they prioritize drilling outside of prime sagebrush habitat areas.</p>\n<p>David Hayes, President Barack Obama’s then-deputy secretary of Interior, said the policy rescissions were very significant because these policies guided the agency’s field staff in how to manage the nation’s vast resources at a time when climate change is already impacting public lands in many ways. “It would be irresponsible as land managers not to take into account these risks, such as drought, fire, invasive species, potential sea level rise, storm surge impacts, wildlife impacts—all of which already are being felt,” Hayes said. </p>\n<aside>“It would be irresponsible as land managers not to take into account these risks, such as drought, fire, invasive species, potential sea level rise, storm surge impacts, wildlife impacts.” </aside>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In his March order, Zinke <a href=\"http://www.hcn.org/articles/new-interior-secretary-moves-swiftly-after-trumps-climate-order\">directed</a> staff to scour their agencies to find policies that hamper energy development. </p>\n<p>A <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/interior_energy_actions_report_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> published by the Interior Department in October outlined dozens of policy changes in the works to remove barriers to energy development. The report says that even some of the nation’s most treasured areas—including national monuments, national conservation lands and wild and scenic rivers—won’t be spared from Trump administration efforts to promote energy development.</p>\n<p>The new order, which was effective immediately and does not require congressional approval, stems from Zinke’s March directive. It did not specify how the rescinded policies hindered energy or what policies, if any, will take their place.</p>\n<p>Among the policies erased by the December order was <a data-linktype=\"external\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343674/Chapter-201-20Climate-20Change-20Policy-20-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-val=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343674/Chapter-201-20Climate-20Change-20Policy-20-2.pdf\">the climate change chapter of the Interior Department’s manual</a>. This chapter stated that it was the department’s policy to “adapt to the challenges posed by climate change to its mission, programs, operations, and personnel. The Department will use the best available science to increase understanding of climate change impacts, inform decision-making, and coordinate an appropriate response to impacts on land, water, wildlife, cultural and tribal resources, and other assets.”</p>\n<p>This 2012 policy required national parks and other public lands to consider climate change when developing resource management plans and when permitting various activities. It instructed them to consult the departments’ new Climate Science Centers and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives so they can be guided by the best science available. The policy responded to a 2009 executive order by Obama, which Trump rescinded in March. </p>\n<p>Joel Clement, who was the Interior Departments top climate change official before he <a href=\"http://www.hcn.org/issues/49.20/department-of-the-interior-whats-driving-interior-whistleblower-joel-clement-to-dissent-ryan-zinke\">quit</a> in October, was a main architect of the policy. He says it gave agencies the authority to plan for the myriad of challenges public lands face from climate change. Without the policy they no longer have clear authority. “All of these agencies will fail at their missions if they don’t plan for the impacts of climate change,” Clement said.</p>\n<p>Another policy erased by Bernhardt’s order was <a data-linktype=\"external\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343675/Chapter-6-Landscape-Scale-Mitigation-Policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-val=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343675/Chapter-6-Landscape-Scale-Mitigation-Policy.pdf\">a chapter added in 2015 that encouraged land managers to look beyond the small parcels of land </a>impacted by a single project when considering mitigation. Instead, it asked them to see how mitigation efforts fit into the conservation goals for larger areas surrounding the projects. This applied to permitting various activities such as mining, drilling for oil or building a solar power plant. The BLM, National Park Service or Fish and Wildlife Service would require the company to first avoid and minimize any impacts to natural resources. If impacts were unavoidable, a company would have to “compensate” by designing a mitigation project that would have to reflect broader conservation goals. For instance, if they had to fill in a wetland or build a road through sagebrush habitat, they’d have to invest in restoration projects that replaced the habitat lost.</p>\n<p>Hayes said traditionally land managers only looked at the areas impacted by the project or perhaps inside the borders of their own park or refuge. But because climate change is impacting resources across large regions, it became important to start managing across jurisdictional boundaries. The department set up 8 regional <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://nccwsc.usgs.gov/csc\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Science Centers</a> and <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://lccnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives</a> to help land managers study how the broad impacts of climate change should impact their work. (The Trump administration has proposed slashing funding the <a href=\"http://www.hcn.org/articles/dc-dispatch-interior-climate-science-centers-could-ride-out-the-trump-administration\">Climate Science Centers</a> and eliminating the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, but so far Congress has continued to fund both.)</p>\n<p>The new order also rescinded BLM’s 2016 mitigation manual and mitigation handbook. These policies guidelines built on the principles of the Interior Department’s mitigation policy and were much more detailed and specific to the kinds of projects BLM authorizes. The handbook both describes how to assess the impacts projects will have on natural resources and outlines how to devise mitigation projects to offset those impacts. BLM is the agency that manages the nation’s energy resources on public lands, including those overseen by the Forest Service.</p>\n<p>The agencies are still legally required under the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-83/pdf/STATUTE-83-Pg852.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">National Environmental Policy Act</a> to mitigate the harmful effects of development and consider climate change. Now they’ve been told not to let climate change considerations or mitigation burden energy development. And they have no guidebook to help them navigate these competing mandates. That confusion could leave the door open for a lot of lawsuits. “That takes you down a very dangerous road for other resources and uses of public lands,” Culver said. “I think it’s going to make the situation worse both for the resources on the ground and for whatever projects they approve.”</p>",

Thursday’s announcement drew a swift <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/jeff-sessions-new-enforcement-policy-threatens-multibillion-dollar-legal-cannabis-industry-1/\">rebuke</a> from criminal justice reformers and members of Congress concerned about a potential federal crackdown on the burgeoning multibillion-dollar industry.</p>\n<p>So does Sessions’ move signal the beginning of the end for legal weed? Mark Kleiman, an expert on federal drug laws at New York University, doesn’t think so. “All he really said was if a US attorney wants to make one of these cases, I’m withdrawing the guidance telling him not to do so.”</p>\n<aside>“Does it benefit your political career to start prosecuting state-legal businesses?”</aside>\n<p>Whether or not pot entrepreneurs may actually face prosecution depends largely on whether the Drug Enforcement Administration chooses to investigate them for violating federal law, Kleiman says—something the agency may not be inclined to do. DEA resources are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/california-defiant-in-face-of-federal-move-to-get-tough-on-marijuana.html\">“spread thin</a>” fighting the opioid epidemic, and Sessions has reportedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByJohnFrank/status/949026720673185792\">said</a> he doesn’t intend to shift DOJ resources away from fighting violent crime to go after legal pot shops.</p>\n<p>Whether any prosecutions materialize will also depend on whether the handful of US attorneys in the six states that operate recreational marijuana programs choose to pursue them, Kleiman says; Colorado’s US attorney has already <a href=\"http://kdvr.com/2018/01/04/u-s-attorney-for-colorado-status-quo-on-marijuana-prosecutions/\">said</a> he won’t change his hands-off approach. “Does it benefit your political career to start prosecuting state-legal businesses?” Kleiman says. “That’s putting aside the question of, in the midst of an opioid epidemic, does anybody have time for one of these cases? The answer is no.”</p>\n<p>The DOJ’s hands may be tied, in part, by the <a href=\"https://merryjane.com/news/a-brief-history-of-rohrabacher-farr-the-federal-amendment-protecting-medical-marijuana\">Rohrabacher-Farr amendment</a>, which has been attached to congressional budget legislation since 2014 and prohibits the department from going after legal medical marijuana programs. (Sessions has asked congressional leaders not to renew the amendment when Congress votes on the next spending bill.) Small-time illegal dealers don’t have too much to fear, either, because the feds seldom prosecute minor cases, says Jolene Forman, a staff attorney at the Drug Policy Alliance. Presumably, neither do recreational users.</p>\n<aside>“If they come after the legal industry, we’ll fight. We’ll go to court. Can they get a jury to convict us? Good luck with that.”</aside>\n<p>But industry players who do get caught in the federal crosshairs will likely be made “an example” of, Forman says. Last May, another DOJ memo <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/jeff-sessions-charging-gudelines/\">directed</a> federal prosecutors to pursue the “most serious, readily provable” charges in all criminal cases, reversing yet another Obama-era guidance not to charge offenders with drug crimes that could trigger decades-long mandatory minimums. “I think that we can speculate that people that are arrested for federal marijuana law violations even when they’re complying with all state and local laws will be prosecuted to the fullest extent.”</p>\n<p>Pot entrepreneurs say they’re willing to take that risk. Andrew DeAngelo, director of operations at Harborside, a Bay Area company that runs two dispensaries and recently expanded into cultivation, told me his company will continue with business as usual. “If they come after the legal industry—particularly operators like Harborside that are compliant and work very hard to do everything right—we’ll fight. We’ll go to court. Can they get a jury to convict us? Good luck with that in Northern California.” The most immediate consequence of Sessions’ decision for California’s recreational pot market will be to “spook” investors, DeAngelo told me.<b><br>\n</b></p>\n<p>Especially in legalization states, prosecutors may have trouble convincing juries to return convictions, Forman says. Polling shows that nearly <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/357053-poll-64-percent-of-americans-support-legalizing-marijuana\">65 percent</a> of American adults support legalizing pot for recreational use, and more than <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2432\">90 percent</a> support it for medical purposes. </p>\n<aside>“You raid the dispensary. You find out who the owner is. You take his house.”</aside>\n<p>Sessions does have other enforcement <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/sessions-plans-to-increase-seizure-of-property-from-suspects/\">tools</a> at his disposal, such as civil assets forfeiture—by which a person’s money and property may be taken if the authorities suspect it is tied to illegal activity. “You raid the dispensary. You find out who the owner is. You take his house,” Kleiman says.</p>\n<p>But such a strategy could draw major political blowback. Sessions is already facing some. Cory Gardner, a Republican senator from Colorado, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, said he would block Sessions’ DOJ nominations unless he reverses course on marijuana prosecutions. The mayor of Seattle <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-state-officials-say-they-wont-back-down-on-legal-pot-as-feds-plan-change/\">said</a> yesterday that the Seattle Police Department would not help the feds with any enforcement activity against legal weed businesses. Kleiman expects other jurisdictions will take a similar stance.</p>\n<p>Targeting legal weed is also bad public policy, Forman says, because shutting down state-regulated drug markets would simply push consumers back into the illicit market. And more black market customers means more black market violence, Kleiman says—an outcome contrary to Sessions’ expressed goal of fighting violent crime. “From a rational point of view it makes no sense,” he says. “We’d be much better off with national legalization under tight regulation than under the system that’s now developing.”</p>",

Huzzah! But this is not because CHIP will cost any less. <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53442\">Here’s the breakdown:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost of CHIP: $48.4 billion</li>\n<li>Medicaid savings: $14.8 billion</li>\n<li>Obamacare savings: $26.4 billion</li>\n<li>Revenue increases: $6.6 billion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything is about the same except that funding CHIP now increases the savings from Obamacare by a lot more. But why? Why is it that over the course of only three months, funding CHIP will suddenly save Obamacare $7 billion more than it used to?</p>\n<p>Well, it’s all about the elimination of the individual mandate. First of all, the CBO boffins figure that this will cause Obamacare premiums to go up. This in turn means that the savings from enrolling a child in CHIP instead of the more expensive Obamacare is higher.</p>\n<p>Second, they also figure that more parents will decide to forego insurance thanks to the higher premiums. Now pay close attention. If CHIP goes away, some parents will decide to buy into Obamacare anyway because they want their kids to be insured. That costs the government money since it subsidizes Obamacare. With the higher premiums, it will cost the government even more. Thus, extending CHIP, and <em>preventing</em> parents from enrolling in Obamacare, will <em>save</em> more money.</p>\n<p>Did you get all that? If you didn’t, don’t worry. The bottom line is that by making Obamacare worse and more expensive, the savings from moving people off Obamacare and into CHIP gets bigger. Pretty awesome, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>The net result of this is that extending CHIP funding will cost essentially nothing. That’s sure going to make it easier to pass. Did Orrin Hatch know this all along? Is that why he kept saying he wasn’t worried about getting CHIP reauthorized? I kinda doubt it, but you never know. If he did understand all this, he’s one smart cookie, isn’t he?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Christopher Steele is not the issue. Yet the former British intelligence official who wrote a series of unconfirmed reports on Trump-Russia connections during the 2016 campaign seems to have become the main target of congressional Republicans. On Friday, two Republican senators—Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina—released a letter they had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/christopher-steele-dossier-judiciary-committee.html\">sent</a> the previous day to the Justice Department and the FBI requesting a criminal investigation of Steele. There have been no other known congressional criminal referrals related to the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election or to interactions between Trump associates and Russians during the campaign.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, Capitol Hill Republicans have intensified both their attack on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation and their call for a quick end to the congressional inquiries. And with this move, Grassley and Graham are trying to bolster the Republicans’ Trump-saving counter-narrative: the real scandal is the Steele dossier. </p>\n<p>Pause for a moment and ponder this. The US intelligence community has concluded that Vladimir Putin ordered a clandestine act of information warfare against the United States to harm Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump during the election. And during that race, Trump’s camp had a series of contacts with Russians or suspected cut-outs. Also throughout the time Putin’s operation was under way, Trump and his lieutenants kept denying this assault was happening—even after his top campaign aides were informed that Moscow wanted to secretly assist Trump <em>and</em> after Trump was briefed by US intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the hack-and-dump assaults targeting Clinton and the Democrats. That is, the public now knows that the United States was attacked by Putin, that Trump associates were interacting with Russians during this period, and that Trump and his crew, intentionally or not, provided cover for Moscow by insisting no such operation was occurring. </p>\n<p>Yet what now draws the ire of congressional Republicans the most is Steele and his reports. </p>\n<p>A full and complete investigation of the Trump-Russia scandal would certainly consider the role of the Steele memos. But the Republicans have fixated on the Steele dossier to create a distraction to undermine the foundational realities of the controversy. And it’s not the first distraction they have tried to create. Remember the so-called “unmasking” scandal of last spring? It was not a scandal, but it was an attempt by congressional Republicans, led by Rep. Devin Nunes, the GOP chair of the House intelligence committee, to prop up another controversy to divert attention from the Putin’s meddling and Trump-Russia interactions. In that episode, Nunes and others suggested the big wrong was that US officials had unmasked the redacted identities in intelligence reports of Americans who had been picked up by intelligence intercepts talking to foreigners, such as Russian officials. It turned out there was nothing improper with this and was S.O.P. </p>\n<p>The Republicans later moved on to a new big distraction: Steele. Their contention was that his memos, prepared for a research firm, Fusion GPS, which was being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, had been the trigger for the FBI’s investigation of the Trump-Russia contacts, which began last July. This meant, they insisted, that the FBI probe had been poisoned from the start, kicked off by unverified political opposition research. Here was their view of the scandal: a nefarious, Democratic-funded outfit had used phony info to manipulate the FBI into investigating Clinton’s opponent. (In some versions of this tale, the FBI is a witting partner, part of a Deep State that eagerly wanted to sabotage Trump from the start.)</p>\n<p>There was never any evidence for this GOP fairy tale. But a few days ago, a giant hole was blown into it, when the<em> New York Time</em>s<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">revealed</a> that what prompted the FBI to open its Trump-Russia investigation last summer was a tip the Australian government conveyed after Trump campaign aide (and now felon) George Papadopoulos told an Aussie diplomat that he had heard from an intermediary with Russian officials that Moscow had dirt on Clinton, including thousands of emails. So, no, dear Fox News viewers, the Steele memos—which Steele did share with the FBI (due to his shock at what his sources were telling him)—did not lead to the bureau’s investigation. (Recently, I was drawn into the GOP mishegas, when Republican congressional sources insinuated to <em>Politico </em>that an FBI official was the source  for the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump/\">article I published a week before Election Day</a> that revealed the existence of the Steele memos and disclosed that Steele had shared his material with the bureau. Their implication: the FBI was spreading the Steele memos to create an October Surprise to tarnish Trump. The problem: no one from the bureau was a source for that story.)</p>\n<p>This latest development—the Australian connection—clearly has not stopped Republicans from pushing the it’s-all-because-of-Steele conspiracy theory. And now, as Mueller’s investigation moves ahead and continues to threaten the Trump administration, Republicans who seem less concerned with how Trump aided and abetted Putin’s assault on an election are seeking to keep this story alive by targeting Steele with a criminal referral. It is impossible to evaluate the validity of any case against Steele, since the referral mentions no details and appears based on classified information Grassley and Graham have received. And it is important to note that anyone can make a criminal referral to the Justice Department and the FBI, and neither body is under any obligation to act upon a referral. The senators’ referral letter hints that Steele lied to FBI agents about his contacts with reporters when he spoke with the bureau during the campaign about his reports. (Interest declared: I am one of the reporters who interacted with Steele during this period.) Presumably, the FBI would be in a position to evaluate on its own whether a criminal investigation was warranted. </p>\n<p>Had Grassley and Graham devoted as much time and attention to digging into the real guts of the Trump-Russia scandal so they could provide the American public with a full accounting of what happened, their focus on Steele and his memos would not reek of political cynicism. Yet the Republicans on the Hill have signaled they want to smother and finalize the congressional inquiries and get this whole damn thing over with—and protect Trump and, perhaps as a necessary evil, Putin. </p>\n<p>The Republican Party, which for decades claimed it was the party that championed patriotism and national security, has jettisoned these priorities for Trump protectionism. It simply doesn’t seem to give much of a damn about what happened during the 2016 campaign and what Trump did to encourage or assist the Russian operation to subvert a US election. Steele may now well be the latest victim of the GOP’s abdication of its responsibility to safeguard the country.</p>",

In this case, it’s AEI visiting scholar Bruce Meyer talking about <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publication/so-just-how-big-a-deal-is-eitc-fraud-anyway/\">fraud in the EITC program:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>James Pethokoukis:</strong> So, what about that fraud issue many conservatives gripe about? Is it an overpayment or mispayment issue? What is happening there with that?</p>\n<p><strong>Bruce Meyer:</strong> I think that that’s overstated. You sometimes will hear numbers like 30% — I probably shouldn’t repeat these numbers — that a substantial share of the dollars are paid in error. But many of these calculations don’t go back and say, “Well, the money went to grandma instead of her daughter who we think should get the credit.” Those statistics often will count the money that goes to grandma but then not net out the money that should have gone to the daughter, so it would’ve been paid out anyways; it just went to the wrong person.</p>\n<p>….It’s a scandal that the instructions for the Earned Income Tax Credit — I haven’t looked at the most recent tax guide — but it used to look something like 18 very dense pages out of the entire 200 pages of tax guide, so it’s just way too complicated. It’s not surprising that there are lot of errors under that circumstance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The EITC is a program that provides tax refunds to people who work. Liberals like it because it helps poor people. Conservatives like it because it only rewards people with jobs. Economists like it because it doesn’t act as a disincentive for work. Aside from Medicaid,¹ it’s one of the biggest and broadest anti-poverty programs we have:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_anti_poverty_programs2.gif\" class=\"wp-image-544056\" height=\"497\"></figure>\n<p>The problem with the EITC is that for the past couple of decades conservatives have been pushing a story about the program being riddled with fraud. In the 90s, Bill Clinton managed to pass an EITC expansion, but only on condition that he agree to an extra $100 million solely to audit EITC applicants—at a time when Newt Gingrich was busily <em>cutting</em> funds for the IRS audit unit that mostly checks up on high-income taxpayers.</p>\n<p>But most EITC “fraud” is just unintentional errors. As Meyer points out, the rules surrounding the EITC are complex, and the biggest part of the complexity revolves around children. Generally speaking, EITC is only available to families with kids, and the rules about residency and custody and so forth are many pages long—not to mention the added complexity related to income calculations and benefit levels. It’s no wonder that mistakes are frequent.</p>\n<p>But here’s an odd thing: if there are lots of mistakes in claiming the EITC, there are also lots of mistakes in claiming the Child Tax Credit. Many of the rules are similar, and similarly complex. And yet conservatives almost never complain much about that. Why? Most likely because the EITC is limited to poor people while the CTC doesn’t start phasing out until family income is above $100,000. To Republicans, the EITC is a <em>welfare</em> program targeted largely at blacks and Hispanics while the CTC is a <em>family</em> program that helps lots of middle-income folks. That makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>¹Medicaid spending clocks in at around $550 billion counting both state and federal contributions. It’s nearly ten times bigger than the #2 anti-poverty program.</p>",

In September, she <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/lena-waithe-wins-emmy-black-woman-comedy-writing-1202562040/\">became</a> the first black woman to win a comedy writing Emmy for the show’s “Thanksgiving” episode—Denise’s coming-out story, modeled on Waithe’s own. Her latest endeavor, Showtime drama series <em>The Chi</em>, proves that Waithe is no one-trick pony. Set in her hometown, it chronicles the interconnected lives of several black characters—including Brandon, an aspiring chef who loses his half brother to gun violence, and Kevin, a wide-eyed kid who sees something he shouldn’t have. In the process, Waithe paints a gritty portrait of Chicago that’s as vivid and authentic as Spike Lee’s portrayals of Brooklyn. “It’s about how honest, how real can I make this,” she says.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother Jones:</strong> First off, your shoe game is crazy. How did you become a sneakerhead??</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Waithe:</strong> Man, I’m from Chicago! There’s a real sneaker culture there that you can’t escape, because of the Jordans and all that. Once I started making some money, I was like, “I’m gonna start collecting.” I became obsessed, much to my girlfriend’s chagrin. But I love it.</p>\n<aside>“I’m not in the business of making us look clean, but I don’t want us to look like monsters either.”</aside>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> Tell us a bit about your childhood in the Chi.</p>\n<p><strong>LW:</strong> I grew up in an all-black neighborhood in the same house my mom did, which was really cool. The kids I played with were the children of the kids that she grew up with. And I went to this magnet school my mom found, and most of the kids were African American. There was a real sense of community. If I did something in the street that neighbors saw, they would go tell my grandmother. That was something I think a lot of kids don’t have today. I was grateful. It made me feel like I was a part of something bigger than myself.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> How does that upbringing factor into your writing for this series?</p>\n<p><strong>LW:</strong> I really want the sense of black people being interconnected: If you black and you from Chicago, there’s a connective tissue we all have. The characters bump into each other in a very organic way—a portion through tragedy. But it’s also about surrogate big brothers; even if you’re not blood related, that doesn’t mean I can’t look out for you.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> The first episode is bookended by the funerals of two boys. What was your intent there?</p>\n<p><strong>LW:</strong> Just to show the differences when one boy has prospect of being a basketball player versus when one is sort of a petty thief and has a single parent that isn’t attentive—as well as what the grieving looks like for both kids. Your life is more valued if you have a talent that society can benefit from. That’s what Jason represents. [At his funeral] there’s a little white kid with his mom, and a letter jacket that looks just like Jason’s. That’s who’s grieving him. There’s no white kid at Coogie’s funeral—he’s a kid from the block who has to care for himself. He doesn’t have a dog so he plays with a stray. His life looks very different from Jason’s, but both lives are valid. Their deaths bring these characters that I’ve created together.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> Between the deaths, though, you bring us lighthearted moments—childhood crushes and jokes about cooking for hipsters.</p>\n<aside>“<strong>I’m a queer black woman and I’m an artist and I make things that I care about. People can either embrace it or they don’t.”</strong></aside>\n<p><strong>LW:</strong> I’m a comedy writer! This is the first drama I’ve ever written, and maybe the only one. I wanted the show to feel super black, super authentic, super Chicago—but real. I’m not in the business of making us look clean, but I don’t want us to look like monsters either. I think there is a little bit of hero and villain in all of us. And I wanted the characters to embody that, so you kind of find yourself rooting for someone that does something bad, or you find yourself wondering, “Oh, what’s <em>this</em> person going to do?”</p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> What challenges have you faced as a queer black woman in Hollywood?</p>\n<p><strong>LW: </strong>Being a black woman period, the challenges you face of being treated like a second-class citizen. [But] I don’t look at it as challenges. I mean, this is who I am. I’m a queer black woman and I’m an artist and I make things that I care about. People can either embrace it or they don’t. </p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> It’s been an interesting time for black TV writers, with Issa Rae, Justin Simien, Donald Glover and others creating shows that are unapologetically black.</p>\n<p><strong>LW:</strong> There’s definitely a bit of a renaissance happening, but there’s still a long way to go. There’s still not enough people of color—we got like four shows. There needs to be more new voices and more black show creators and show-runners, and more people of color in positions of power. So I want to be careful about patting ourselves on the back too soon. Also, there’s still no queer person of color as a protagonist on any show!</p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> So what’s your advice for Hollywood?</p>\n<p><strong>LW:</strong> They just need to say yes to these stories and take risks on new writers—which is a big thing I’m trying to help do: make sure they know about these writers, make sure that I’m introducing them to the industry in a real way. The only way you really see change is by helping to create it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>When it comes to purging names from the voter rolls, the state of Ohio is second-to-none. Since becoming secretary of state in 2011, Republican Jon Husted has excised more than <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/trump-administration-on-the-right-to-vote-use-it-or-lose-it/\">2 million voters</a> from the state’s registration lists. On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in a high-stakes case over whether one of Husted’s controversial<strong> </strong>methods for removing voters violates federal law. And if the court sides with Husted, it will open the door for states across the country to use what amounts to a legal loophole to cancel the registrations of millions more Americans.</p>\n<p>The controversial Ohio program is<strong> </strong>just the newest version of a century-old strategy of culling voter lists. Though less well known than other historic forms of voter suppression—such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and all-white primaries—purges have long been used to limit the influence of ethnic and racial minorities. And just like these more explicitly racist policies, purges have frequently been justified as a necessary antidote to voter fraud. </p>\n<aside>People in Democratic neighborhoods were struck from the rolls at twice the rate of people in Republican areas.</aside>\n<p>Ohio’s process for culling its rolls has been criticized as a “use it or lose it” program. Every year, the secretary of state mails a notice to every registered voter who has not cast a ballot in the previous two years, asking that they return the mailing to confirm their continued eligibility. If they fail to respond and then fail to vote over the next four years, they are<strong> </strong>removed from the rolls. Ohio has been using this method since 1994, but in 2014, in response to a lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch, Husted agreed to begin sending notices every year instead of every other year.</p>\n<p>Civil rights groups say that Ohio’s policy discriminates against minorities, who tend to<strong> </strong>vote less often, and that it prevents eligible voters from casting ballots. According to a <em>Reuters</em> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-votingrights-ohio-insight/use-it-or-lose-it-occasional-ohio-voters-may-be-shut-out-in-november-idUSKCN0YO19D\">analysis</a> of voter rolls in Ohio’s three largest counties, people in Democratic neighborhoods were struck from the rolls at twice the rate of people in Republican areas. Moreover, <em>Reuters </em>notes, “neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor, African-American residents are hit hardest.” Five other states use similar processes to purge their voter rolls, but Ohio’s program is the most aggressive.</p>\n<p>In 2016, opponents of Ohio’s voter purge program sued, arguing that it<strong> </strong>violates the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which<strong> </strong>prohibits states from<strong> </strong>using a resident’s<strong> </strong>failure to vote to trigger deregistration. If the plaintiff in the case had voted in past elections, they say, he never would have been removed. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, and Husted subsequently reinstated thousands of purged names in the fall of 2016. As a result, about 7,500 people who would otherwise have been unable to vote ended up casting ballots in the November 2016 election.</p>\n<p>But after the election, Husted appealed the ruling. “[M]aintaining the integrity of our elections and guarding against voter fraud is too important to do nothing,” Husted said in a <a href=\"https://www.sos.state.oh.us/media-center/press-releases/2017/2017-02-03/#gref\">statement</a> last year. He <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-980-ts-merit-brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">argues</a> that the program doesn’t technically violate the NVRA because failure to respond to the mailed notice—rather than a failure to vote in and of itself—is the “proximate cause” of a canceled registration. Federal law allows a notice-confirmation process, he contends, but does not dictate how states should decide who receives these notices. The fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case suggests that at least some of the justices are considering allowing states to use this loophole to resume the age-old practice of singling out voters for removal on the basis of inactivity.</p>\n<p><span>In the past decade</span>, many states have enacted registration and voting restrictions that have a disproportionate impact on minority voters, from rolling back early voting days to implementing strict voter ID laws. Ohio has <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/08/appellate_court_rules_ohio_ear.html\">done</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/us/federal-judge-says-2-ohio-voting-laws-are-unconstitutional.html?_r=0\">both</a>. Like these reforms, the state’s voter purge program should be viewed “as part of a larger pattern that’s emerging in the last 10 years or so as a way to either disenfranchise or…limit the influence of the votes of particular groups,” says Orville Vernon Burton, a historian at Clemson University who has testified as an expert witness in opposition to voter identification laws in Texas and South Carolina. “Now we’re in a process of passing laws that are clearly partisan and political in nature to keep people from voting.” The justification for these policies—that they will combat voter fraud—has been received with skepticism and disbelief by many historians and election experts, in large part because the actual<strong> </strong>incidence of voter fraud is <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/voter-suppression-kevin-drum/\">extremely low</a>.</p>\n<p>The practice of purging voters from the rolls based on a failure to vote dates back to the early 20th century, when cities began to keep permanent voter lists and often maintained them by canceling the registrations of people who had not recently cast a ballot. The official reason for these purges was to keep the voting rolls accurate and prevent fraud by political machines such as New York’s infamous Tammany Hall. But the purges had the effect, often <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=wmborj\">purposeful</a>, of disenfranchising Irish, Italian, and Jewish workers, as well as other minority groups. Several states forced voters in large, immigrant-heavy cities to re-register annually but ignored evidence of corruption in rural company towns, notes Harvard University historian Alexander Keyssar in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Right-Vote-Contested-History-Democracy/dp/0465005020\"><em>The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States</em></a>. In a more blatant attempt to block Jewish voters who might support socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs, in 1908 New York City’s registration days were <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/02/voting_rights_supreme_court_case_why_is_new_york_defending_the_voting_rights.html\">limited</a> to the Sabbath and Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>By the 1960s, Americans were voting at significantly lower rate than citizens of other western democracies. In 1963, the President’s Commission on Registration and Voting Participation <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/16-980-bsac-American-History-Professors.pdf\">singled out</a> restrictive registration laws and administrative hurdles such as purges of voter who skipped elections. The commission noted that an “unexpected business trip or a broken ankle can deprive a citizen of his right to vote” and that this failure to cast a ballot then means the person “cannot vote now.”</p>\n<aside>“The idea of voter fraud is an old canard that’s been used from time immemorial…when the party in power at the time is wanting to control the vote.”</aside>\n<p>Purging was not the only registration restriction that was justified, at least officially, as an attempt to combat fraud. In Texas, the architect of the state’s 1902 poll tax law <a href=\"http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/documents/Veasey4073.pdf\">described</a> it as a fraud-prevention measure that would “protect the citizen against machine politics, convention dictation, and corrupt methods at the polls.” Texas continued to defend its poll tax in these terms until 1966, when a federal court struck it down as an unconstitutional tool to disenfranchise African Americans.</p>\n<p>After losing in court, Texas set about replacing its poll tax with an annual re-registration requirement. Newspapers described the new policy as “patterned on the old poll tax system, but minus the tax.” Texas’ Democratic governor at the time, John Connally, framed it as a fraud-prevention measure. “Annual registration is the most logical means of preventing fraud and guaranteeing the purity of the ballot box,” he said. After a federal court struck this down in 1971, Texas passed a new law that would require every registered voter to re-register one time or be cut from the rolls. The Department of Justice blocked this mass purge under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. (In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated the section of the law under which the DOJ had blocked this purge, stating that “things have changed dramatically” since the 1960s.)</p>\n<p>“I think the idea of voter fraud is an old canard that’s been used from time immemorial almost, but certainly in my study of American history when the party in power at the time is wanting to control the vote,” says Burton. When he testified in the district court case over Texas’ 2011 voter ID law, he displayed a PowerPoint presentation that ticked through the state’s history of voting restrictions—from the all-white primary in 1895; through a law that prohibited aid to illiterate voters, the poll tax, and attempted purging; to the current voter ID battle. Each one, he noted, had the same rationale: preventing voter fraud.</p>\n<p>Though the courts blocked Texas’ attempts to purge its rolls, that was the exception. Even after the civil rights movement, neither the courts nor the Justice Department cracked down on most purge methods, including laws elsewhere in the nation that purged registrations based on a past failure to vote. In a 1972 case, for example, a federal court upheld a Pennsylvania<strong> </strong>law that removed from the rolls<strong> </strong>people who hadn’t voted. The court did so despite evidence that nearly 60 percent of those removed for nonvoting were actually eligible. By the 1980s, 40 states and the District of Columbia had similar<strong> </strong>laws on their books. Ohio was one such state. Its constitution required the cancelation of any voter’s registration if he or she had failed to vote over a four-year period. Meanwhile, voter participation across the country continued to sink during the 1970s and 1980s. After the 1988 presidential election saw the lowest turnout in modern American history, Congress began to consider national legislation to fix the problem.</p>\n<p>The result was the NVRA,<strong> </strong>a 1993 law that sought to increase opportunities to register to vote. Dubbed the motor-voter law, the bill’s best known provision required states to allow residents to register at their local DMVs. The law also placed limits on how states could remove voters from the rolls, including an explicit prohibition on purging voters based on a failure to vote. It is this provision that is being debated as the Supreme Court reviews Ohio’s case.</p>\n<p>In a brief opposing Ohio’s purge policies, several historians, including Burton and Keyssar, argue that allowing Ohio to use non-voting to trigger the removal process would contravene the NVRA’s purpose. “Congress understood that the continued use of that practice contributed to the substantial voter turnout problem in the United States, particularly among African Americans and other minority groups,” the brief states. “Widespread use of voter inactivity as a trigger by States to initiate notice-confirmation processes would in turn result in broad swaths of Americans being mailed purge notices. And whether a significant proportion of the American electorate remain on the voter rolls would then hinge on whether or not registrants respond to those notices.”</p>\n<p>Ohio isn’t hiding from the country’s long history of purging for inactivity. The state’s brief to the Supreme Court frames the practice as a time-tested tradition as American as apple pie. “By the 1950s, ‘[c]ancellation for failure to vote [had become] the principal means used in most permanent registration jurisdictions to purge the lists,'” Ohio’s brief <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-980-ts-merit-brief.pdf\">states</a>, quoting historical documents. “Ohio’s history exemplifies these trends.”</p>\n<p>In the next few months, the Supreme Court will decide whether to resurrect this American tradition.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span>Manila, 1901. The</span> city is a steamy mix of grand Spanish colonial buildings mildewed from tropical humidity, the ramshackle dwellings of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos, and horse-drawn wagons rumbling through squares and gates with names like Plaza de Cervantes and Puerta de Isabel II. Hastily erected hotels, houses of prostitution, and gambling dens cater to a flood of newly arrived Americans: bureaucrats, missionaries, merchants, speculators—and soldiers. Despite its swift victory in the Spanish-American War three years earlier, the United States is now in the middle of its first protracted war in Asia. Filipino nationalists, delighted to be free at last from several centuries of Spanish rule, have discovered that the US troops with leggings tucked into their high boots whom they first hoped were liberators are in fact here to establish an American colony. The brutal conflict now underway will eventually leave more than 200,000 Filipinos dead.</p>\n<p>Although he may have watched the Army vs. Marines baseball games while off duty, <a href=\"https://www.ikn.army.mil/apps/MIHOF/biographies/Van%20Deman,%20Ralph.pdf\">Captain Ralph H. Van Deman</a> was almost certainly too abstemious to loiter in the city’s bars and brothels or place bets at the Manila Jockey Club, but for an ambitious US Army officer, wartime Manila was nevertheless the place to be. Van Deman was far from the usual picture of a dashing young warrior: tall, gray-eyed, and almost cadaverously thin, he had a long, hawklike face and ears that seemed to jut out from his head at right angles. His route to the military had been an unusual one, because after attending college first in Ohio and then at Harvard, he had studied law for a year, then completed medical school. An early experience that may have influenced him more than these many classrooms, however, was his service, during his student years, in the Ohio National Guard when it suppressed a violent coal miners’ strike. By 1901, Van Deman had been on active duty for 10 years.</p>\n<p>When he took up a new post in Manila in February that year, the lanky 35-year-old polymath at last discovered his métier, an endeavor that would remain an obsession for the rest of his life. The conflict in the Philippines, now <a href=\"http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=3161\">largely forgotten</a>, was a counterguerrilla war, and for that, the US military needed not battleships and fortresses, but intelligence information. In an old Spanish military building in a walled quarter of the city, Van Deman was placed in charge of the Bureau of Insurgent Records—a post that would turn him into the founding father of American surveillance. His assiduous spying in war and peace would span half a century and three continents, and presage a vengeful nastiness eerily familiar to us today: racial stereotyping, the smearing of political enemies with fact-free rumor, and charges that those who opposed US government policy were unpatriotic or treasonous. Van Deman’s career would culminate in helping a particularly unscrupulous future president on his path toward the White House.</p>\n<p><span>In Manila, the</span> American occupation authorities were deeply alarmed that so many Filipinos wanted independence. Van Deman put the Army’s intelligence operation into high gear, ordering 450 officers throughout the archipelago to provide data “from every possible source” on all mayors, priests, and “active civilian sympathizers.” As a sign of his operation’s growing importance, it was moved to US Army headquarters on the bank of the Pasig River, one floor down from the commanding general. To compile his storehouse of data on suspect Filipinos, Van Deman used the most sophisticated information management system of his day: file cards. Each was printed at the top, “Descriptive Card of Inhabitants,” and had spaces for an American officer to fill in such details as a person’s appearance, age, occupation, “blood connections,” and “relative importance in the community.”</p>\n<p>The prisoner Santiago Nepomuceno, for example, suspected of killing an American, was “very ignorant and depraved.” Escolastico Salandanan was “very thick with former leading insurgent officers.” Under the “Attitude toward U.S.” section of the cards, comments range from “doubtful” and “presumably treacherous” to “ostensibly very friendly, but in his heart I believe him strongly antagonistic to Americanism.”</p>\n<p>For the data on his cards, Van Deman drew not only on US Army officers but on the territorial and Manila police, both under American control. In the capital alone, his office had 200 undercover agents on the payroll. Tips also flowed in from the tax and customs authorities. Combined, writes University of Wisconsin history professor Alfred W. McCoy, who has closely studied Van Deman’s career, these forces contributed to “a modern surveillance state.” Surveillance, of course, is always about control—in this case suppressing the independence movement. It soon withered, not only because of American military might but because nationalists suspected, correctly, that their organizations were infiltrated.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/431_010218_vandeman_b2_960.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-543345\" height=\"504\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>A stereograph of nationalist officers imprisoned in Manila, 1901</span></p>\n<p><span>Library of Congress</span>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On the thousands of Van Deman’s dusty file cards that survive today, one fact goes eerily unmentioned: Much of the information about these Filipino patriots was obtained <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/25/the-water-cure\">by torture</a>. The US Army’s routine method of interrogation on the islands was a precursor to modern-day waterboarding. “Now, this is the way we give them the water cure,” an infantryman named A. F. Miller wrote to his family in Nebraska in 1900. “Lay them on their backs, a man standing on each hand and each foot, then put a round stick in the mouth and pour a pail of water in the mouth and nose, and if they don’t give up pour in another pail. They swell up like toads.” Photographs show Filipinos enduring this.</p>\n<p>Why, according to Van Deman, did these “insurgents” want independence? “This was owing principally, I am sorry to say, to advice from anti-imperialist and anti-administration citizens in the United States,” he told his Harvard classmates in a volume of autobiographical reports. “God only knows how many Filipino and American lives these people are responsible for.” Like so many white men of his era, he felt anyone who resisted colonialism must be a dupe of outside agitators.</p>\n<p>The security apparatus Van Deman helped build would last through several decades of American colonial rule. By the 1920s, Manila’s police force would have some 200,000 alphabetized file cards covering fully 70 percent of the population, a surveillance lover’s dream. As in so many countries since then, ruthless police and military forces built or heavily aided by the United States have continued to burden the Philippines ever since the country finally became independent in 1946.</p>\n<p>Van Deman was not the only white man of his era who saw colonialism as natural. It was Rudyard Kipling, after all, who had urged America to “<a href=\"https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/Kipling.asp\">take up the white man’s burden</a>” by annexing the islands. Caucasians, millions believed, had a God-given right to rule everywhere over their black and brown inferiors. Among those who disagreed, however, were some of the 6,000 black US Army soldiers who took part in the Philippine War. Horrified generals withdrew some “colored regiments” ahead of schedule after at least 20 black soldiers deserted, most joining the other side. Van Deman would have heard much talk of such doings over the Australian beef and French wines at Manila’s Army and Navy Club. His belief that black Americans were not to be trusted would become a cornerstone of the next stage of his work.</p>\n<p><span>After returning home,</span> in 1903 Van Deman married a woman 15 years younger. Like so many women of her time, Sadie Van Deman left little trace in the written record, with one startling exception: She was the first woman in the Americas to fly. A friend of Katharine Wright, the sister of Wilbur and Orville, she asked if she could join Wilbur on a four-minute flight in 1909. On several later trips, he allowed her to take the controls. After some years, however, the couple divorced. Van Deman continued to rise up the military promotion ladder and was selected for the first class to attend the new Army War College. In early 1917, he married again, and that union would last.</p>\n<p>At this time, the United States was bitterly torn over whether to enter the vast, bloody war raging in Europe. Many Americans resisted the push to war, particularly radicals who believed that workers should be fighting the ruling class, not each other. But public outrage was rapidly growing over the sinking of American ships by German submarines and the notorious “Zimmerman Telegram” from the German foreign minister urging Mexico to ally itself with Germany and regain its “lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.” The day that President Woodrow Wilson went to Congress to call for war, an angry mob broke into the headquarters of the Emergency Peace Federation across the street from the White House, smashing chairs and desks and spattering the office with yellow paint. When the New York Yankees played their season opener the following week, they marched onto the diamond in military formation, resting bats on their shoulders like rifles.</p>\n<aside>On the thousands of Van Deman’s dusty file cards that survive today, one fact goes eerily unmentioned: Much of the information about these Filipino patriots was obtained by torture.</aside>\n<p>America’s declaration of war on April 6, 1917, found the gaunt figure of Van Deman stuck in a staff position at the War Department, frustrated that the Army did not have an intelligence agency. He put this proposal to the Army’s chief of staff, General Hugh Scott, who turned him down. Then he made an adroit but risky leap over Scott’s head and used two go-betweens to place the idea before Secretary of War Newton Baker. His lobbying was successful, and Baker ordered him to set up a new Army intelligence branch. Soon promoted to colonel, Van Deman pursued the task with zeal, his staff swelling to 282 officers, 29 sergeants, and more than 1,000 civilians, most of them volunteers.</p>\n<p>The war Van Deman was intent on waging was not in the trenches of France, but at home. In his mind, Germany and its allies were far from the only enemy. The year 1917 also saw the Russian Revolution, and the triumph of the Bolsheviks greatly inflamed American political tensions: between powerful captains of industry and a militant labor movement; between the long-dominant Protestants of northern European descent and waves of later immigrants, mostly Catholic and Jewish, who were often sympathetic to socialism and anarchism; and between the propertied classes of small towns—like Van Deman’s native Delaware, Ohio—and the rapidly growing big cities that seemed filled with threatening foreigners and radicals.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/431_20171122_vandeman_02.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-543323\" height=\"1036\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Paying the death penalty for crime—garroting a criminal at Bilibid Prison, Manila, P.I.</span></p>\n<p><span>Library of Congress</span>\n<p>Van Deman could amass his huge staff because his worldview so embodied that of the American establishment of his time. He saw himself as defending the traditional social order against rebels at home and revolutionary ideologies from abroad. He deeply distrusted immigrants, people of color, and any political activism they engaged in. He warned the Justice Department, for instance, of weekly meetings at the home of the principal of the Colored High School in Baltimore, “presided over by a white man” of “loose habits” who had allowed talk that “the atrocities committed by Germany are no worse than the lynchings and burnings which have taken place in the South.”</p>\n<p>“In the fall of 1917,” he later wrote, “it became evident that agents of the Central Powers were circulating among the Negro people of the United States.” This was nonsense, for it did not take any German or Austro-Hungarian spies to make black Americans angry that they were forced into underfunded schools and low-paid jobs, and that in the first two decades of the 20th century alone more than 1,400 black men were lynched.</p>\n<p>Nothing was beyond suspicion. One report to his office related “several incidents of where [sic] colored men had attempted to make appointments with white women.” Van Deman was ready to believe the wildest of rumors, asking one agent to investigate word that “fortune tellers, supposed to be gypsies…[are] entering the kitchens of well-to-do residents and telling the fortunes of the servants. These fortunes…all point out that unless Germany wins the war the colored race will be made slaves again.” He gave credence to another claim that Germans stirring up blacks were going door to door posing as sewing-machine salesmen. From an agent in New York came a report that “German money in large sums is being used in the Harlem district among the negro population” to purchase $600,000 worth of property.</p>\n<p>Just as in the Philippines, surveillance was about control. When a Howard University dean wrote a pamphlet against lynching, Van Deman sent an agent to have a stern talk with him. Black newspapers were monitored closely—and threatened. The most influential, the <em>Chicago Defender</em>, was visited by one of his agents, who reported that the editor had “been told that he would be held strictly responsible and accountable for any article appearing in his paper in the future that would give rise to any apprehension…I have…informed him that the eye of the government is centered upon his paper.” Van Deman urged the YMCA to keep the NAACP’s <em>The Crisis</em> out of its reading rooms, where it might be seen by black soldiers.</p>\n<p>One object of his intelligence unit’s suspicions in 1917 was the Reverend A. D. Williams, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. A forceful organizer, Williams helped put together an Equal Rights League to protest discrimination in voting, and he helped set up a branch of the NAACP that would register black voters. “It behooves us,” said one telegram, “to find out all we possibly can about this colored preacher.” A report in Williams’ file termed him a “radical Negro agitator” because of his campaign to create a black high school. The grandson of “this colored preacher” would eventually become a pastor of the same church and in turn the subject of a later generation of government surveillance: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>\n<p><span>Another group Van </span>Deman went after was labor organizers. As with anti-lynching campaigners, he was convinced that such homegrown organizations as the Industrial Workers of the World, the “Wobblies”—founded in Chicago well before the war—must be connected to the enemy. He asked for a federal investigation of deposits made in Wobbly bank accounts in Arizona and referred to “the many rumors that the recent I.W.W. activities are supported by funds from German sources.”</p>\n<p>Also under suspicion was the Conference of Christian Pacifists in California, a group he judged “watery and neutral as far as its war loyalty is concerned.” In a letter to the secretary of war’s office, he boasted of his threats against the organization: “Ample warning…has been given to all concerned in these activities. Public opinion finally was aroused at various points on the Pacific Coast regarding their pernicious public gatherings.” To the warden of the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, where the anarchist Emma Goldman was <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/fragmentofprison00paul\">locked up</a>, Van Deman sent word that Goldman was still wielding influence from behind bars and suggested “that it might be well to place greater restrictions upon her.”</p>\n<p>Always alert to possible rivals, Van Deman artfully blocked an attempt by the Army’s Signal Corps to start its own domestic counterespionage operation. And, however unreliable it was, the stock of intelligence gathered by his huge staff allowed him to deal with officials who far outranked a mere colonel. He corresponded, for example, with former President Theodore Roosevelt, and with the governor of Montana, whom he warned about a possible mining strike. Cabinet members and newspaper correspondents were regular guests at a weekly luncheon he hosted at military intelligence headquarters, known as the General Hindquarters.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"630\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/431_20171122_vandeman_01-630.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-543328\" height=\"833\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span>US Army / Library of Congress</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>But then he fatally overreached, in testifying before the Senate Military Affairs Committee in April 1918. The country needed military tribunals to take “quick and summary action” against Americans who opposed the war, he told the senators, because the existing courts were “tied up with forms and red tape and law.” Note the last word.</p>\n<p>Despite the administration’s draconian crackdown on anti-war dissent, President Wilson immediately declared himself “wholly and unalterably opposed” to such tribunals. By this point, senior military and Justice Department officials were feeling their power threatened by Van Deman’s burgeoning surveillance empire and saw to it that he was dispatched, with only the vaguest of assignments, to Europe.</p>\n<p>For a skilled navigator of the military hierarchy, however, this merely offered new opportunities, particularly since the American commander at the front, General John J. Pershing, was an Army War College classmate. When the fighting ended, Van Deman managed to get himself placed in charge of all security arrangements for the monthslong peace conference at Versailles, with a staff of 56.</p>\n<p>Paris in the spring of 1919 was a social climber’s dream: There was a whirl of military band concerts and embassy dinners and balls, as Allied diplomats and generals exultantly redrew the maps of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East with little thought of where the smoldering resentment of defeated Germany might lead. Van Deman’s letters home to his wife, Irene, known as Cherry, are a curious mixture of passion (“Cherry dearest…to think of holding you tight in my arms again!”), dire political warnings (“There is a widespread attempt to start a world revolution along Bolshevic [sic] lines”), and bureaucratic triumphs (“Gen. Pershing had personally told the Adjutant General… to issue an order saying definitely that I was to perform my duties in connection with the Peace Commission in addition to my other duties and that I was not to be detached from G-2, G.H.Q.A.E.F.”).</p>\n<p>After Versailles, Van Deman resumed his rise in the Army, although jealous rivals kept him away from anything to do with intelligence. When he retired in 1929, it was as a major general.</p>\n<p><span>With its balmy </span>climate and dense array of Army, Navy, and Marine bases, San Diego had long been a favorite spot for those leaving the armed forces, and that was where the Van Demans settled. His friends included many other retired military men, and he found this conservative part of the country congenial. Even local labor leaders had a right-wing bent, and San Diego—with only a small Latino population at that point—was dominated by a Protestant, Anglo oligarchy, a far cry from the East Coast cities filled with recent immigrants and subversive ideas.</p>\n<p>Within a few years of moving to San Diego, Van Deman embarked on yet a new phase of his passion for surveillance. The operation to which he would devote the remaining two decades of his life did not even have a name. With volunteer help from his wife and a retired officer friend, plus two clerks paid for by the Army, he quietly created a private intelligence bureau. Its records came to almost fill an apartment adjoining his own. “I’m sure I am not exaggerating,” he wrote in a Harvard class report, “when I say that since 1932 I have devoted at least twelve hours a day to this work.” His efforts were aided by funds, he hinted, contributed by wealthy sympathizers. As in the Philippines 30 years earlier, to record details about people he was watching, Van Deman used file cards. Eventually, 85,000 of them would index and summarize the contents of a dozen filing cabinets containing more than 90 linear feet of agents’ reports, photographs, letters, and other documents. “It was a rare Red,” the San <em>Diego</em> Union would write years later, “whose appearance in this area was not noticed.”</p>\n<p>“Essentially Van Deman was a vigilante,” says Athan Theoharis, a professor emeritus of history at Marquette University and the author of a number of books about the FBI and surveillance. “A self-appointed one. Talk about a true believer! This was his life’s work. He saw himself as a savior of the nation. He had this mission, which was amazing in terms of the amount of information he collected and turned over to people who could act on it.”</p>\n<p>Among those who did were district attorneys eager to prosecute subversives and employers’ groups who wanted to know who was trying to organize their workers. Always an adroit networker, Van Deman traded information with them as well as with police and sheriffs’ departments and old friends in military intelligence who were spying on civilians. One Army unit in San Francisco made copies of so much material for him that it made a rubber stamp, “VanD.” An official in the San Diego post office, writing to “My dear General,” happily supplied the return addresses of packages and letters sent to an unnamed “person in regard to whom we have had recent conversation.”</p>\n<p>For hunters of subversives, the 1930s were busy years. The devastating toll of the Great Depression spurred the growth of radical and socialist groups. Police red squads cracked heads at picket lines while organizations from the American Legion to the US Chamber of Commerce set up departments to hunt Communists. Nowhere were tensions higher than in California, where existing hunger and joblessness were exacerbated by desperate migrants fleeing into the state from the Dust Bowl.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/431_112117_vandeman_c_960.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-543321\" height=\"744\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n<p><span>Van Deman during his posting as “director of negative intelligence” (i.e., security chief) at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919</span></p>\n<p><span>Ralph H. Deman papers / Hoover Institution Archives</span>\n<p>Van Deman’s undercover agents monitored the Communist Party so thoroughly that one account reports on a party meeting that drew only four people. Nonetheless, the general accumulated reports on everything from a Young Marxian Pioneer Troop to “Airplane Pilots with Red Tendencies.” For him, surveillance was a matter of love—or, as he would say, patriotism—not money. He apparently charged no one for the information he shared, even though detective agencies were making the same kind of espionage a multimillion-dollar business; in the mid-1930s, Pinkerton alone employed 1,200 spies in various industries.</p>\n<p>Communists were indeed working with, among others, the state’s miserably paid farmworkers, many of them Mexican or Mexican American. Grower organizations like the Associated Farmers of California became grateful consumers of Van Deman’s information. From friends in Navy intelligence in 1933, the general heard that a Communist named James Dixon would be organizing a strike of celery pickers near San Diego, word he relayed to others in his network. He exchanged information about a lettuce harvesters’ strike with the district attorney of Imperial County, a place where labor protesters were repeatedly beaten up by vigilantes deputized by local sheriffs and police. When San Francisco saw a massive waterfront strike in 1934, Van Deman obtained a list of suspected agitators and was soon discussing the situation with the city’s Industrial Association.</p>\n<p>Although much data in his files came from police departments or other agencies, thousands of pages are from his own undercover operatives. Some of the correspondence is written in invisible ink, with agents identified only by letters and numbers. B-11, for example, was a particularly active fellow who posed as a Communist recruiting seamen and then farmworkers, and who reported on a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union—a frequent target of the general’s scrutiny. Another agent posed as a delegate to a convention of the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union. The general’s crew was not above the occasional burglary: Agent C-14 provided a list of distributors and subscribers of the Communist newspaper <em>People’s</em> <em>World</em>—“found in trunk of Celia Shermis’ car.”</p>\n<aside>“He saw himself as a savior of the nation. He had this mission, which was amazing in terms of the amount of information he collected and turned over to people who could act on it.”</aside>\n<p>By now, Van Deman had also grown obsessed with the film industry. A report on the movie star James Cagney notes darkly that “he wrote a piece for the Screen Actors Guild, which…is the employes [sic] rebellion against the producers.” In <em>Here Comes the Navy</em>, Cagney’s character “is antagonistic to and creates hatred for his superior officers.” Even more sinister, Cagney had reportedly contributed to a relief fund for striking cotton pickers.</p>\n<p>Schools and colleges were another arena for vigilance. An ally on the San Diego Board of Education used the Van Deman files to vet anyone who applied to host an event on school property. A long list of “Radical Professors and Teachers” ranged from Columbia University to Milwaukee State Teachers College. A list of suspicious professors at UCLA and the University of Southern California noted that one was “an admirer of Upton Sinclair” and another was “questionable…is married to a Polish Jewess.”</p>\n<p>Jews, indeed, were often among Van Deman’s targets. In a letter to an Army colleague, he declared himself “convinced that there may be more than a modicum of truth” in the connection between “Bolshevism and Semitism.” The general trafficked in conspiracies, and one document in his files reports on a veritable trifecta of villains by citing a “Yiddist [sic] pamphlet” that “urges the Masonic Fraternity to come to the support of the Soviet Union.” Duly filed as well is a chart someone sent in claiming that both Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt had Jewish ancestry.</p>\n<p>Among other sources feeding Van Deman’s anti-Semitism was agent B-31, one of the few operatives whose name we know; historian McCoy has identified her as a California advice and gossip columnist, Mary Oyama Mittwer. During a 1946 trip to the East Coast, she reported that “organized Jewry is out to control organized labor.” Furthermore, “the Jewish people are slowly but surely securing a stranglehold on the poultry and egg business.” And worse lay ahead: Jewish refugees “are coming in here by the shiploads, they have Hotels in NY City where they are re-outfitted, their jewelry is turned into cash; and then…homes are purchased for them.” A shadowy plot was behind it all: “Felix Frankfurter and possibly Henry Morgenthau manage to pull a lot of strings in the background…The motion picture and stage industry…is practically controlled by the Jewish race.”</p>\n<p>The general was deeply suspicious of President Roosevelt and the people around him. One report notes that Frances Perkins—longtime secretary of labor and the first woman in an American Cabinet—“admitted her married name is Mrs. Paul Wilson.” A follow-up investigation Van Deman ordered to this apparently incriminating piece of information produced a copy of a 1910 Massachusetts marriage certificate showing a Paul Wilson marrying someone else—possible evidence of further skullduggery. (The general had both the date and place wrong: Perkins had quite publicly married another Paul Wilson in New York in 1913.)</p>\n<p>During these California years, Van Deman found what every zealot yearns for: a disciple. This was a younger man named Richard Ellis Combs. For the nearly two decades that their professional lives overlapped, Combs considered the general his mentor, living for a time with him and his wife in San Diego. “Van Deman taught me that to master the field of subversion,” he said years later in a rare interview, “you must read with notebook in hand, summarize everything, then type your own file card…You must do this yourself. You can’t divide the job and let a secretary help. You do it and it becomes your knowledge, your resource. After a while, you will command everything in the field.”</p>\n<p>In 1941, the tall, red-haired Combs began an influential 30-year tenure as chief counsel and lead investigator for the California Un-American Activities Committee, or CUAC. This was the most powerful and choleric of the state legislative groups that echoed witch-hunters at the national level, like the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and later Sen. Joseph McCarthy.</p>\n<p>Over the years, bolstered by intelligence passed on by Van Deman, CUAC held hearings, fiercely grilled witnesses, and built up its own gargantuan files, which eventually came to cover 125,000 individuals and organizations. Even public school sex education programs in the town of Chico came under the committee’s scrutiny as possibly Communist-inspired.</p>\n<p>We don’t know everything Van Deman and Combs did together because the general was always discreet. “There are a lot of things that I want to talk over with you when you come down,” he once wrote to Combs, “which are just as well not put on paper.” But we do know that the two strategized how to use the mysterious death of a UCLA student after attending a political meeting in 1948 to fan the flames of anti-communism. Their efforts helped feed a frenzy that soon resulted, among other things, in the University of California requiring all employees to sign a loyalty oath. The subsequent firings of those who refused to sign sent a chill through the state’s entire educational system.</p>\n<p><span>In his zeal</span> for surveillance, his sweeping hostility to African American activism, and his approval of black-bag jobs by his agents, Van Deman foreshadowed no one so much as a figure 30 years his junior, J. Edgar Hoover. Indeed, the two men knew each other. Van Deman always had an eye for those on the rise, and in 1922 he had pulled strings to get an Army Reserve commission for Hoover, then a 27-year-old Justice Department official. In the next decade, the general resumed contact with Hoover. His letters to the FBI chief were almost fawning; in 1938, he apologized for having made “an attempt to break in on the privacy of a very busy man trying to get a little well-earned rest.” Van Deman’s courting of Hoover was successful, however, because he was included in a crucial meeting Hoover hosted in the run-up to American participation in the Second World War. On May 31, 1940, Hoover gathered in his office high officials from the Army, Navy, and State Department to divide up intelligence-gathering territory. “This was like the pope dividing the unexplored world [between Spain and Portugal] in 1493,” says McCoy. “The FBI got counterintelligence at home—and operations in Latin America. Military intelligence, out of which the OSS and then the CIA evolved, got the rest of the world.”</p>\n<p>Van Deman’s presence at the meeting is testimony to his ability to ingratiate himself with the powerful, because at this point he had been retired from the military for 11 years and had no government job. Hoover soon asked a San Diego FBI agent to “devote himself exclusively to the task of reviewing General Van Deman’s files and extracting all information of value to the Bureau.”</p>\n<p>The FBI came to rely on Van Deman’s archive so much that the general developed a library card system showing when the bureau had borrowed and returned a file. The FBI’s San Diego office informed Hoover that agents were in touch with the general “almost daily.” After he turned 80 in 1945, Van Deman began suffering various illnesses and an FBI man in San Diego kept Hoover apprised, sometimes giving the address of a hospital so that “the Director” could send a get-well-soon letter or telegram.</p>\n<aside>The FBI came to rely on Van Deman’s archive so much that the general developed a library card system showing when the bureau had borrowed and returned a file.</aside>\n<p>As Van Deman aged, he fretted about the fate of his treasured files. The FBI, however, began to develop a few doubts about the reliability of his data, and it also discovered a major bureaucratic obstacle to merging his files with its own: The general’s 85,000 file cards were on four-by-six-inch cards, while the FBI used three-by-five cards. Nonetheless, a few months before Van Deman died at the age of 86 in 1952, the FBI chief in San Diego recommended to Hoover that the bureau take custody of the files when the time came, because “if the General were to become aware of the fact that neither the Army nor the Bureau had any interest…this thought would most certainly leave him heart-broken, disillusioned and possibly hasten his death.”</p>\n<p>In the end, the files continued to be used by various government agencies for well over a decade and were largely divided between the Army and a secret library maintained by friends of Van Deman in a California National Guard armory. About half the general’s documents have disappeared; the remainder eventually came to rest in the National Archives, where you can examine 97 boxes of them containing more than 42 linear feet of paper. But before the files landed there, the general’s allies stripped out a great deal of material, including the identities of the various undercover agents and of the donors who financed the vast private intelligence network. Nonetheless, the files contain much of interest, including a few hints of the support Van Deman provided to a cunning and unscrupulous politician who would reach the most powerful position in the land.</p>\n<p>In 1946, a popular, liberal, five-term congressman from Southern California, Jerry Voorhis, was running for reelection against a political unknown—a 33-year-old former Navy logistics officer named Richard Milhous Nixon. Voorhis had explicitly rejected the endorsement of any group that didn’t disavow communism. But Nixon, onstage in a debate in South Pasadena, thunderously brandished at him a piece of paper that supposedly contained an endorsement by a Communist-infiltrated group. Nixon followed this up with a well-financed advertising campaign darkly hinting at more of the same. He pulled off a stunning upset on Election Day and quickly gained a seat on the House Un-American Activities Committee.</p>\n<p>When Nixon went on to run for the US Senate in California in 1950, against Rep. Helen Gahagan Douglas, it was on a wave of flamboyant Red-baiting. Workers from Nixon’s phone banks called hundreds of thousands of registered voters, asked if they knew that Douglas was a Communist, and then hung up. White voters received postcards from a nonexistent Communist League of Negro Women, saying, “Vote for Helen for Senator.”</p>\n<p>Under sunny skies at a Douglas campaign rally of 5,000 people in Long Beach’s Bixby Park, with Eleanor Roosevelt speaking, Douglas supporters noticed people passing out leaflets on pink paper that accused their candidate of sinister Communist ties. Nixon claimed that his opponent—who, he noted, was married to Jewish actor Melvyn Douglas—was “pink right down to her underwear.” The “pink sheets” helped defeat Douglas, and two years later Sen. Nixon was elected vice president.</p>\n<p>What remains in Van Deman’s well-expurgated files shows few traces of his aiding candidates for elective office—something that would have been illegal for a man whose clerical help was provided by the US Army. Nonetheless, several clues in the 97 boxes suggest that the general played a role in Nixon’s rise to power. The ambitious young politician had been no stranger to Van Deman. He had ties to the general’s protégé, Combs, and had been a featured speaker at a conference that Combs and Van Deman had helped organize in 1948 of state Legislature Red-hunters from around the country. Van Deman’s files hold hints of the help he provided Nixon. One is a photograph of a Nixon campaign event where a demonstrator opposing the candidate is identified by one of Van Deman’s trademark code numbers. Another is an agent’s report with a revealingly hostile reference to Nixon’s adversary: “A few more Helen Gahagan Douglas’s and the left-wing congressmen will be prying open the most secret records of the federal security agencies.” Finally, Van Deman’s spies had long been collecting damaging information on Douglas’s actor husband: Agent B-11 listed him, for example, as a supporter of efforts to send bandages and clothing to victims of the Spanish Civil War, and another report identified him as part of a group of Hollywood luminaries supporting striking lettuce pickers.</p>\n<p>California Democrats later charged that some of the scurrilous material in the Nixon campaign’s “pink sheets” against Douglas had come from Van Deman. When these accusations were renewed after Nixon became president, unnamed White House officials queried by the <em>New</em> <em>York</em> <em>Times</em> did not deny the charge. They said only that it was no longer “pertinent.” But for Van Deman to help Nixon at this ruthless stage of his ascent toward the nation’s highest office was highly pertinent. Ironically, the blueprint for the Watergate scandal that finally forced the 37th president to resign could have been taken from Van Deman’s own life’s work: a black-bag job, a secret search for information about political enemies, a mania for surveillance.</p>\n<p>Today all of us leave behind so many electronic traces that spying is both easier and more complex than it was in the days of Van Deman’s agents stealing papers out of a car trunk. But there is still a dark thread that stretches back across generations. The general, happily, never reached the White House. But someone who recently did was helped by the release of information pilfered from the opposing political party, and then built a presidency on a way of thinking very similar to Van Deman’s, from suspicion of immigrants to a fondness for conspiracy theories to treating wild rumor as fact. Donald Trump probably never heard of Ralph Van Deman, but one person knew them both: Richard Nixon, a man who, according to Trump, “always wanted me to run for office.” Nixon and Van Deman both would now be smiling.</p></figcaption></figure></figcaption></figure></figcaption></figure>",

A Utah native, a Mormon, and an experienced politician, Hatch himself has given Romney his blessing and support. “I’m hopeful he’ll run, because he would be just fine,” Hatch <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/kfile-orrin-hatch-mitt-romney/index.html\">said</a> on a Utah radio program Wednesday morning. “And he would certainly be somebody who, I think, could succeed me into the job.”</p>\n<p>Romney, however, is not likely to receive the same ringing endorsement from the president. The two have had a long relationship that included some highs and many, very public, lows. For instance, in February 2016,<strong> </strong>Trump, who is not known for his restraint in matters of personal feuds, did not hold back when Romney joined the bipartisan chorus that asked the candidate to release his tax returns:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/702833969537142788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>But to characterize the relationship between Trump and Romney as purely contentious would be to ignore a longer history. <span>Almost exactly four years before the President called Romney a “dope,” private-citizen<strong> </strong>Trump <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?304163-1/donald-trump-presidential-endorsement-announcement\">endorsed Romney’s 2012 candidacy</a> in grand fashion at his hotel in Las Vegas, with Romney and his wife Ann beaming at his side. </span></p>\n<p>“Mitt is tough, he’s smart, he’s sharp,” Trump told the crowd. “He’s not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love.” Romney replied with his own dose of flattery. “There are some things that you just can’t imagine happening in your life. This is one of them,” he said. “Being in Donald Trump’s magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight.”</p>\n<p>Trump had also thrown his weight behind Romney in the<strong> </strong>2008 presidential primary race, but exercised some uncharacteristic humility, noting, “I don’t want to hurt any of the candidates by endorsing them.” </p>\n<p>The relationship between Trump and Romney was a casualty of the bitter 2016 GOP primary that sharply divided the party between establishment Republicans, like Romney, and the new order Trump’s supporters ushered in. Here’s a brief history of the tumultuous, on-again-off-again relationship between the president and the potential Senate hopeful.</p>\n<h3>2003: A couple of rich guys hanging out together</h3>\n<p>Once, the two businessmen-turned-politicians ran in similar social circles. In 2003, then-Governor Romney, Trump, and Trump’s daughter Ivanka attended the 40th wedding anniversary party of New England Patriots’ owner (and longtime Trump ally) Robert Kraft. Joined by star Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and members of the band Aerosmith, guests “huddled under a tent on the 50-yard line where they scarfed Dom Perignon, Beluga caviar, and filet mignon,” according to a <em>Boston Herald </em>article documenting the occasion. The two reunited a few months later when they took in a Patriots’ playoff game from Kraft’s luxury suite. </p>\n<h3>2012: The Romney endorsement</h3>\n<p>Trump had toyed with a 2012 presidential run, and early 2011 polling showed that he stood a chance in fractured field. He eventually stepped away from the race, but not without reminding the public that if he had run, he would have won. His major influence was as the champion of<strong> </strong>the “birther” movement: an unrelenting quest to convince the American public that President Obama had been born in Kenya and was not an American citizen. Trump insisted these assertions could only be disproved with President Obama’s birth certificate, although, once Obama <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/27/president-obamas-long-form-birth-certificate\">presented the document</a>, Trump <a href=\"https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/obamas-long-form-birth-certificate-released/\">continued to insist</a> inspections were required to assess its authenticity.</p>\n<p>Trump’s lavish Las Vegas endorsement of Romney took reporters by surprise: early reports suggested Trump would <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/02/sources-trump-to-endorse-newtor-mitt-113227\">throw his support behind</a> former House speaker Newt Gingrich.

No excuse for hiding your back taxes.”</p>\n<h3>March 2016: The University of Utah speech</h3>\n<p>Romney delivered a speech at University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute in order to offer his <span>“perspective on the nominating process of my party.” During <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/mitt-romney-speech.html\">the speech</a>, Romney called Trump “a con man,” criticized his plans for taxes and the economy, and condemned his positions on immigration and foreign policy. “If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee,” Romney said, “the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.” He reinforced his points on Twitter the same day:</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement</p>\n<p>— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/705471184935190532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><br>\nCandidate Trump decried Romney’s attacks in a Tweetstorm in the days that followed. He even recalled a friendlier time, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/705362027901009921\">wondering</a> “Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MittRomney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MittRomney</a> was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/706176828843663360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 5, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><br>\nIn the coming weeks, Romney emerged as a leader of the Never Trumpers, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/mitt-romney-endorsement\">doing robocalls</a> for Marco Rubio and John Kasich <span>in an effort to foster a “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/what-brokered-convention-gop-rules-favor-trump-n535381\">brokered convention</a>,” a situation in which after the party failed to identify its leading nominee through primaries, it would be forced to conduct a floor vote at the convention. </span></p>\n<h3>May 2016: No ringing endorsement</h3>\n<p><span>As the Republican field narrowed in late spring 2016, and Trump looked more clearly like the GOP’s pick, Romney still refused to endorse Trump. In <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dismayed-romney-says-he-doesnt-intend-to-back-trump-worried-about-demagoguery-and-populism/article/2590558#.VywTb_HNz6k.twitter\">early May</a>, he said he was “dismayed” by the results of primary season and troubled by the “demagoguery and populism” exhibited by his party. Trump did not take kindly to Romney’s lack of support, telling crowds that he had intimidated Romney from seeking a 2016 run. </span><span>“He saw Trump saying he can’t run, because I understand losers,” Trump said at rally <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/281267-trump-romney-walks-like-a-penguin\">in California in late May</a>, adding that</span><b> </b>Romney “walks like a penguin.”</p>\n<p><span>Tensions reached a head in early June when, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/mitt-romney-donald-trump-racism/\">in an interview</a> with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Romney declared that Trump’s brand of political incorrectness would spell trouble for American culture. </span><span>“Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation,” Romney said, “and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.” </span><span>Trump refuted Romney’s claims over Twitter, noting that prominent Americans who had endorsed him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/741600981251657728\">would not have done so</a> “if they thought I was a racist!” He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/741590381503086592\">reminded followers</a> that Romney “choked like a dog” when he sought the presidency four years earlier.</span></p>\n<p><span>Romney—along with senators Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), past presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/07/18/486398726/dumpster-fires-fishing-and-travel-these-republicans-are-sitting-out-the-rnc\">many other</a> high-profile figures in the<strong> </strong>GOP—<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/05/mitt-romney-will-skip-trumps-nominating-convention-in-cleveland/?utm_term=.21710eb5791f\">did not attend</a> the Republican nominating convention in Cleveland that summer.</span></p>\n<h3>November 2016: Cabinet flirtations</h3>\n<p>Frosty relations between Trump and Romney began thaw after November 7.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/797812630312382464\">According to President-elect Trump</a>, Romney had called to congratulate him on his win the week after Election Day. A meeting between the two quickly followed amidst rumors that Romney, alongside former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, was on the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2016/11/trump-secretary-of-state-short-list-231997\">shortlist</a> for Secretary of State. Trump’s eventual pick, Rex Tillerson, was reportedly not yet under consideration. The idea was perhaps inspired by Doris Kearns Goodwin’s <em>Team of Rivals</em>, which Trump had <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/kellyanne-conway-donald-trump-231917\">allegedly referenced</a> in the days following his victory (the move followed a pattern set by President Obama, who had also looked to <em>Team of Rivals</em> when he sought out Hillary Clinton for the role eight years prior.)</p>\n<p>Speculation soared as the President-elect dined with Romney and soon-to-be Chief of Staff Reince Priebus at Jean-Georges restaurant at Trump Tower in New York. While Romney didn’t take back any of his previous criticisms of the President-elect, after leaving<strong> </strong>the restaurant, he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-romney/romney-potential-u-s-secretary-of-state-hails-trump-after-dinner-idUSKBN13P0A7\">described the dinner conversation</a> as “enlightening, and interesting, and engaging.” He said that the evening gave him “<span>increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.” Romney <a href=\"http://time.com/4813499/mitt-romney-hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state/\">reportedly would have accepted the position</a> if Trump had chosen him over Tillerson.</span></p>\n<h3>December 2017: The Utah visit</h3>\n<p>After being passed over for the State job, Romney remained relatively quiet as President Trump assumed office. After <a href=\"http://time.com/4906506/mitt-romney-president-trump-charlottesville/\">Trump’s response</a> to violence in Charlottesville, Romney, in a long Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mittromney/posts/10154652303536121\">post</a>, condemned the president for stating there was “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/us/politics/trump-charlottesville-tim-scott.html\">blame on both sides</a>” of the white supremacist-led violence that injured dozens and took one life. “Whether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn,” he wrote. Just a few weeks later, he became a Trump supporter again, praising the speech the president gave <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/09/19/trump-united-nations-full-speech.cnn\">at the United Nations</a> for its “<span>strong and needed challenge to UN members to live up to its charter and to confront global challenges.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Their not-so-distant feud, however, was in the background during the president’s  December visit to Utah to announce <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/utah-monuments-trump-weir/index.html\">the sizable reduction of two of the state’s national monuments</a> that Hatch had requested.<strong> </strong>Amidst rumors of Hatch’s retirement (and Romney’s potential run), </span>Trump <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/trump-mitt-romney-orrin-hatch-utah-senate/index.html\">urged Hatch</a>  to “continue to serve your state and your country in the Senate for a very long time to come,” suggesting the 83-year-old senator run again in 2018. While a Trump spokesperson denied that Trump’s support for Hatch should be interpreted as a slight to Romney, and that Romney was “not a focus” of the President’s trip, the official <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/trump-mitt-romney-orrin-hatch-utah-senate/index.html\">acknowledged</a>, “When the guy forms an exploratory committee, we will have a view.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have a feeling that Donald Trump will not be giving any impromptu interviews to Michael Schmidt again. Schmidt reports today in the <em>New York Times</em> that Robert Mueller is very strongly investigating the question of whether Trump obstructed justice by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html\">trying to derail the Russia investigation:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>President Trump gave firm instructions in March to the White House’s top lawyer: <strong>stop the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, from recusing himself in the Justice Department’s investigation</strong> into whether Mr. Trump’s associates had helped a Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election….<strong>Mr. Trump said he had expected his top law enforcement official to safeguard him</strong> the way he believed Robert F. Kennedy, as attorney general, had done for his brother John F. Kennedy and Eric H. Holder Jr. had for Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>….Mr. Mueller has also been examining a false statement that the president reportedly dictated on Air Force One in July in response to an article in <em>The Times</em> about a meeting that Trump campaign officials had with Russians in 2016. A new book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by Michael Wolff, says that <strong>the president’s lawyers believed that the statement was “an explicit attempt to throw sand into the investigation’s gears,”</strong> and that it led one of Mr. Trump’s spokesmen to quit because he believed it was obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>….Experts are divided about whether the accumulated evidence is enough for Mr. Mueller to bring an obstruction case….Some experts said the case would be stronger if there was evidence that the president had told witnesses to lie under oath.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In late March Trump went ballistic over James Comey’s testimony before Congress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Trump’s frustrations with the inquiry erupted again about three weeks later, when Mr. Comey said publicly for the first time that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. were conducting an investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. Mr. Comey had told Mr. Trump in private that he was not personally under investigation, <strong>yet Mr. Comey infuriated Mr. Trump by refusing to answer a question about that at the hearing where he spoke publicly.</strong></p>\n<p>….Two days after Mr. Comey’s testimony, an aide to Mr. Sessions approached a Capitol Hill staff member asking whether the staffer had any derogatory information about the F.B.I. director. <strong>The attorney general wanted one negative article a day in the news media about Mr. Comey, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This whole subject remains maddeningly hard to make sense of. The problem is that Trump’s behavior is consistent with two diametrically opposite conclusions. Needless to say, it’s consistent with the possibility that Trump colluded with Russia in some way and is desperate to cover it up. But it’s also consistent with the possibility that Trump is entirely innocent. A person with Trump’s volcanic temper and bottomless feelings of grievance would probably react exactly the way he has if he had done nothing wrong.</p>\n<p>So far, all the evidence we’ve seen publicly has come tantalizingly close to obstruction of justice, but has never quite gotten there. But even if it doesn’t, consider this: the precise legal definitions of obstruction apply only in a courtroom, not in an impeachment trial. The kinds of things Trump has done are more than enough to constitute a “high crime” if enough members of Congress think it does. At the moment, Republicans prefer keeping Trump in office. But if they ever decide he’s too big an albatross and they’d rather deal with President Pence, Mueller is almost certain to give them enough to make a case with.</p>",

However, according to an annual <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.3322/caac.21442/full\">report </a>from the American Cancer Society released Thursday, many young and middle-aged black Americans are not reaping equal benefits from improved cancer <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/cancer-prevention/art-20044816\">prevention</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/cancer-screening-guidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html\">detection</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types.html\">treatment</a>.</p>\n<p>“While we are making all of these advances, I think we can all recognize that we can still do a lot better,” said Dr. L. Michelle Bennett, director of the Center for Research Strategy at the National Cancer Institute, who was not involved with the report. “All of these advances are not reaching everybody equally.”</p>\n<aside>“While we are making all of these advances, I think we can all recognize that we can still do a lot better.”</aside>\n<p>From 2014 to 2015, the U.S. cancer death rate dropped by 1.7 percent, mostly driven by decreasing death rates for lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The decline follows a trend that began in 1991, resulting in nearly 2.4 million fewer cancer deaths in the years since. The report points to several reasons behind the improving mortality rate, including reductions in smoking and advances in early detection and treatment.</p>\n<p>Though the racial gap in cancer deaths continues to narrow as well, this mainly reflects progress for older age groups, which masks “stark persistent inequalities for young and middle-aged black Americans,” the report says. Overall, the cancer death rate in 2015 was 14 percent higher for non-Hispanic blacks than for non-Hispanic whites, down from a peak of 33 percent in 1993. Yet, while the gap narrowed to 7 percent in those 65 or older, for those younger than 65,<strong> </strong>mortality rates were 31 percent higher for blacks than for whites, with much larger disparities in many states.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 4\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The smaller gap for the older black population is partly due to universal health care access for seniors through Medicare, says Ahmedin Jemal, vice president of the Surveillance and Health Services Research Program at the American Cancer Society and a co-author on the report. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/NHIS/SHS/2015_SHS_Table_P-11.pdf\">lack of insurance</a> among younger black Americans may contribute to their higher mortality rate compared to whites.</p>\n<p>“We know that insurance is a gateway to accessing care,” Jemal said, and therefor improving access can reduce the racial gap. In Delaware, for example, paying for screenings and treatment for the uninsured helped to <a href=\"http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2012.47.8412\">drastically reduce</a> colorectal cancer mortality rates and shrink the gap between blacks and whites.</p>\n<p>Researchers agree, however, that the reasons behind racial disparities in cancer deaths are multi-pronged and still not fully understood. They involve the interplay of genetics, lifestyle, and environment, as well as access to health care, Bennett said, noting “We really need more studies, large studies, that really comprehensively examine how these factors come together.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Some states in the report, such as New York and Massachusetts, have seen the racial mortality gap disappear for whites and blacks over 65. “This is encouraging because it means messages about screening and early detection have been heard,” said Linda Goler Blount, president and CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.bwhi.org/home-4/\">Black Women’s Health Imperative.</a> Those shrinking gaps suggest minorities “are taking advantage of preventive services like screening mammography and colonoscopy, have reduced smoking and, for those over 65, are receiving quality care,” she said.</p>\n<p>One area of concern exemplifying the racial mortality gap can be seen in outcomes for breast cancer. Although African-American women develop breast cancer at similar or slightly lower rates, they are more likely to die from the disease compared with white women, according to the American Cancer Society’s <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/cancer-facts-and-figures-for-african-americans/cancer-facts-and-figures-for-african-americans-2016-2018.pdf\">facts and figures</a> on African Americans and cancer.</p>\n<p>“Black women get breast cancer, on average, five to seven years younger than white women, so our cancers are detected later, and when they’re more advanced,” Goler Blount said. She also explained that younger black women are more likely to have an aggressive form of breast cancer known as <a href=\"https://tnbcfoundation.org/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer/\">triple negative</a>, a much more difficult to treat subtype of cancer that develops <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures-2015-2016.pdf\">nearly two times</a> as often in black women. The NCI is undertaking its <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/breast-cancer-genetics-black-women\">largest-ever study</a> on the topic to delve into how genetic and biological factors contribute to risk.</p>\n<p>Again, access to health care appears to play an important role. Jemal coauthored a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4998468/Insurance-driving-factor-black-breast-cancer-death.html\">study</a> of women with breast cancer from 2004 to 2013 that found being uninsured accounted for more than one-third of the higher death rate for black women.</p>\n<p>The good news, Goler Blount said, is more than 90 percent of black women are now <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hi/hi-01.2015.html\">insured</a> following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. “If this trend continues and black women continue to be insured, have access to preventive health care and quality treatment when diagnosed with cancer,” she says, “we can expect the gap in deaths due to cancer compared with whites to decrease.”</p>\n<p>As a whole, the new ACS report highlights that more can be done to prevent cancer in the first place, for instance by further reducing smoking, which still accounts for nearly three out of every ten cancer deaths.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-01-04 at 1.16.57 PM\" width=\"787\" src=\"https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-04-at-1-16-57-pm.png\" class=\"wp-image-543823\" height=\"349\"></p>\n<p>In 2018, 1,735,350 new cancer cases and 609,640 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the U.S., the report found.</p>\n<p>“If we, the cancer community, could do a better job of implementing those things we already know work,” Bennett said, “many, many lives could be saved.”</p>",

        "content": "<p><span>On Tuesday, the United States’ top immigration enforcement official said the government should bring criminal charges against<strong> </strong>politicians </span><span>in<b> </b>sanctuary cities. </span><span>The comment, from acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Thomas Homan, begs the now familiar question: Can the Trump really administration <em>really</em> do that?</span></p>\n<p><span>The answer is almost certainly no. Homan’s<strong> </strong>argument relies on a statute that is typically used to target human smugglers; according to Bill Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco who runs the school’s Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic,<strong> </strong></span><span>there’s no precedent, or even a strong legal case, for using it against politicians.  </span></p>\n<p><span>Homan, currently the acting head of ICE who Trump picked to be<strong> </strong>the agency’s permanent director in November</span><span>, </span><a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/01/02/ice-director-rips-california-governor-jerry-brown-sanctuary-state-law\"><span>told</span></a><span> Fox News’ Neil Cavuto that he believes sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials are violating an “alien smuggling statute” by shielding them in their jails. “The Department of Justice needs to do a couple things,” Homan said. “Number 1, they need to file charges against the sanctuary cities.” As the interview wrapped up, he added, “We gotta start charging some of these politicians with crimes.”</span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NwNtoQDoNlI\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span>Many of the United States’ largest cities, including Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, have embraced the sanctuary city label. </span><span>Seth Stein, a spokesman for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, called the comments “unhinged and misinformed” in a statement sent to <em>Mother Jones.</em><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span>The federal </span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324\"><span>statute</span></a><span> in question— 8 U.S.C. 1324—makes it a crime for a person to harbor or shield unauthorized immigrants in “knowing” or “reckless disregard” of the law. </span><span>Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&amp;M who focuses on immigration law and enforcement, tells <em>Mother Jones</em> it’s a “stretch” to think sanctuary cities are coming “anywhere close” to doing that. </span></p>\n<p><span>Hing similarly<strong> </strong>says that those calling for charging sanctuary-city politicians are “shooting from the hip” and “don’t know what they’re talking about.” A successful case under the statute, Hing says, would involve something like bringing an undocumented immigrant into one’s home and then shielding them from ICE. What sanctuary cities actually do is “nowhere near” that, he adds. For one, sanctuary cities do not block immigration officials from making arrests within the city. Instead, they often limit information sharing and block local jails from keeping immigrants beyond their release date so that ICE can pick them up.</span></p>\n<p><span>Cecillia Wang, the ACLU’s deputy legal director, echoed these sentiments and said in a statement that there is “no valid basis to prosecute any state or local official under federal criminal law for carrying out a sanctuary policy.” </span></p>\n<p><span>In the interview,<strong> </strong>Homan took specific issue with California for<strong> </strong>enacting a “sanctuary state” bill that limits state and local officials’ roles in immigration enforcement. </span><span>The <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54\">legislation</a>, which went into effect at the start of the year, blocks law enforcement officials from asking someone about their immigration status and from<strong> </strong>holding an immigrant in jail to assist ICE. It also seeks to make it harder for ICE to detain immigrants near courthouses, hospitals, and schools.

        "content": "<p>I’ve been meaning to weigh in on the latest raft of pieces about the decline of American democracy, the decline of Western liberalism, the decline of globalism, and the decline of everything else in the era of Trump. In a nutshell, I’m far more optimistic than most of the people writing about this. Unfortunately, I haven’t really thought the whole thing through rigorously enough to make a little essay out of it.</p>\n<p>Actually, you might consider that good news. However, I do want to lay down a few markers. Here they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Globally, there’s no question that there’s been a backlash against immigration. But this is hardly the first time that’s happened, and the vast influx of refugees into Europe makes it unsurprising that there’s been a response. Given the size of the refugee crisis, I’m frankly surprised the reaction in Europe has been as restrained as it has been.</li>\n<li>Brexit is not a harbinger. Britain has had a fraught relationship with the EU from the very start, and there’s always been a large contingent of people who oppose British membership. Nor is this some kind of exclusively working-class thing. Conservative Party elites have been euroskeptics for a long time. Brexit is mostly the result of a stupid tactical decision by David Cameron, not a sign of a huge upsurge in xenophobia.</li>\n<li>In the US, there’s no real indication that Donald Trump is a sign of the future rather than an anomaly. His victory was a result of growing polarization and a couple of weird lucky breaks, not a massive backlash against PC culture <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/204269/americans-split-whether-nafta-good-bad.aspx\">and NAFTA.</a><br>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_gallup_nafta.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-543838\" height=\"603\"></figure>\n</li>\n<li>Republicans aren’t “falling into line” behind Trump. They’re just being Republicans. As long as the subject is conservative judges and tax cuts for the rich, they’re on board. When the subject is a border wall or cozying up to Russia, they’re about as divided as they’ve always been.</li>\n<li>Would Trump like to be a dictator? Sure. Every president would probably <em>like</em> to be a dictator. But aside from lots of dumb tweeting, he’s done virtually nothing to seriously break the norms of liberal democracy. He’s issued lots of executive orders, just like Obama did. Courts have overturned some of them, just as they always have. He hasn’t fired Robert Mueller. He hasn’t declared martial law. His judicial nominations have been standard issue Republicans. His Fed nominee is a standard issue Republican. And appointing wingnuts to head the EPA and Interior is standard issue Republican behavior. (Those of us of a certain age have sharp memories of James Watt and Anne Gorsuch Burford.)</li>\n<li>The worst norm-busting thing Trump has done is firing the director of the FBI because he wouldn’t abandon his investigation of Michael Flynn. But this hardly passed unnoticed. It resulted in the hiring of Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor, something that has turbocharged the investigation of Trump and his buddies.</li>\n<li>Republicans are refusing to seriously investigate Trump, but what’s new about that? Congressional investigations have always been partisan. You may recall that Republicans declined to investigate George Bush but went after both Bill Clinton and Obama hammer and tongs. There’s nothing new here.</li>\n<li>Trump is not gaining popularity. <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval\">Just the opposite.</a> He’s even <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2017/12/07/stark-partisan-divisions-over-russia-probe-including-its-importance-to-the-nation/\">lost popularity among Republicans.</a> GOP candidates recently supported by Trump have lost, and generic congressional polls suggest a big Trump-inspired backlash in the 2018 midterms despite a healthy economy acting as a tailwind.<br>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"990\" src=\"http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blog_trump_disapproval_2017.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-543845\" height=\"354\"></figure>\n</li>\n<li>Every scrap of evidence suggests that most of Trump’s staff think he’s an idiot. Many of his cabinet members think he’s an idiot. Congressional leaders think he’s an idiot. And the big difference between Trump and, say, Mussolini, is that Trump <em>really is</em> an idiot. Nor has this changed over time. If anything, this view of Trump has become even more widespread over the past 12 months. This is not a portrait of a man who can take over the country.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trump is still plenty dangerous. But I don’t really see any kind of fundamental change in the country. Working class white men are susceptible to grievance mongering and racially-coded attacks, but that’s been true for a long time. Trade agreements aren’t all that popular among workers, but again, that’s been true for a long time. Remember Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton competing in Ohio in 2008 over who could pretend the hardest that they hated NAFTA? Nor has there been any kind of serious cultural backlash. College kids are still doing dumb things, same as always. Marijuana is being legalized despite Jeff Sessions’s best efforts. Gay marriage is here to stay. There’s been little change on the abortion front.</p>\n<p>Probably the biggest danger we face from Donald Trump is the question of what he’ll do if a crisis hits. A big terrorist attack, for example, could serve as an excuse for some serious hits on democratic rule. So far, that looks unlikely, but it’s a real danger.</p>\n<p>There’s also the chance that he could start a nuclear war, but I now consider that less likely than I used to. Trump has allowed North Korea to make progress on its nuclear technology without doing much about it, and North Korea now has—or is very close to having—a genuine deterrent capability. This will, almost certainly, deter Trump.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The National Rifle Association’s political arm set a fundraising record in 2016, taking in a staggering $366 million. That’s according to the group’s latest annual filing with the Internal Revenue Service, a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4343410-NRA-2016-990.html\">copy</a> of which was obtained by <em>Mother Jones</em>.</p>\n<p>The massive haul was a $30 million increase from the group’s 2015 fundraising effort. It was helped by a single donation of $19.2 million in 2016. The filing lists the source of that massive donation both as a “person” and as the NRA Foundation, a non-profit charitable wing of the organization. An NRA spokesman declined to clarify whether an individual was the ultimate source of that $19.2 million that went from the NRA Foundation to the NRA flagship group, instead referring to IRS instructions that say a “person” can mean “individuals, fiduciaries, partnerships, corporations, associations, trusts, and exempt organizations.” The next largest donor was an anonymous individual who gave $662,000.</p>\n<aside>“You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,” Trump told the NRA.</aside>\n<p>The figures in the IRS filing are for the NRA’s politically active non-profit arm—a 501(c)(4) entity, in IRS parlance. The 501(c)(4), which is legally allowed to participate in political campaigns, spent $412 million in 2016, far more than even its record fundraising figure.<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/nra-donald-trump-guns-fundraising/”#correction”\">*</a> Separately, the NRA has a Political Action Committee, which also engages in electoral spending.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the NRA devoted huge sums of money to winning back the White House and protecting Republican control of Congress; the 501(c)(4) and the PAC <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/11/the-nra-placed-big-bets-on-the-2016-election-and-won-almost-all-of-them/\">spent millions of dollars</a> on television and radio ads. They <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/11/the-nra-placed-big-bets-on-the-2016-election-and-won-almost-all-of-them/\">poured more than $54 million</a> into <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/search/?q=national+rifle+association&cx=010677907462955562473%3Anlldkv0jvam&cof=FORID%3A11\">electing</a> GOP candidates up and down the ballot, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with a focus on supporting Donald Trump and a slate of Republicans running for the US House and Senate. Those investments paid off. All but <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=National+Rifle+Assn&cycle=2016\">a few</a> of the candidates who received NRA backing won their respective elections.</p>\n<p>As president, Trump—who benefited from $10 million in NRA spending backing his candidacy and another <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=National+Rifle+Assn&cycle=2016\">$19.7 million</a> attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton—has spoken at NRA events and pledged his loyalty to the group. “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,” he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/28/donald-trump-nra\">said</a> at the NRA’s annual meeting last April. “The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. You have a true friend and champion in the White House.”</p>\n<p>Trump made fears about gun violence a central part of his campaign, but as president he has done little to curb that violence. At the same time, he has methodically, if quietly, taken steps to relax gun control policies. The Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2017/03/justice-department-gun-background-checks-fugitives/\">tightened</a> the definition of who qualifies as a “fugitive from justice” when it comes to gun ownership, in effect making it easier for certain people with arrest warrants to possess firearms. The Interior Department removed a ban on hunting with lead ammunition on federal lands. And a bill signed last February <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/the-trump-administration-has-already-been-rolling-back-gun-regulations/2017/10/04/5eaad7d6-a86b-11e7-8ed2-c7114e6ac460_story.html?utm_term=.b862bbe4df71\">prohibited</a> the Social Security Administration from reporting recipients with mental impairments to a national background-check database. The NRA <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170302/the-nra-applauds-secretary-zinkes-protection-of-traditional-ammunition\">applauded</a> the latter two <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170228/trump-signs-bill-protecting-due-process-rights-of-ssa-recipients\">actions</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to compare the single $19.2 million donation the NRA received in 2016 to donations from previous years. That’s because similar donation data hasn’t been disclosed on the group’s past annual filings. But the NRA’s top-line financial information suggests that 2016 overall was a banner year. As recently as 2011, the NRA’s 501(c)(4) raised just $211 million, and in 2015 it raised $336 million—$30 million below its 2016 haul. Nearly all of that increase came from donations.</p>\n<p>The full NRA filing can be read below.</p>\n<div>\n<div> <iframe title=\"NRA 2016 990 (Hosted by DocumentCloud)\" src=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4343410-NRA-2016-990.html?embed=true&responsive=false&sidebar=false\"></iframe> </div>\n</div>\n<p><em>* Correction: An earlier version of this article inaccurately described the tax status of the NRA non-profit that raised $366 million last year.

Then a court ruled that a ballot that had been invalidated because the voter marked both Simonds’ and Yancey’s names should in fact be counted for Yancey, and the race was declared a tie. On Thursday, the state board of elections met in Richmond to settle the matter by drawing lots out of a clay bowl. Yancey won.</p>\n<p>The Republican victory, such as it was, will have major ramifications in the Old Dominion, where rejuvenated Democrats<strong> </strong>held onto the governorship in a landslide and captured 15 House seats that Republicans had controlled in the last session.

        "content": "<p>President Donald Trump abruptly <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/trump-just-dissolved-his-own-voter-fraud-commission/\">shut down</a> his commission on election integrity on Wednesday evening. That’s the good news for voting rights advocates.</p>\n<p>The bad news: the Administration is continuing its hunt for voter fraud, based on Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-tale-of-a-trump-falsehood-how-his-voter-fraud-claim-spread-like-a-virus/2017/01/30/47081e32-e4ed-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html\">false claim</a> that “millions of people” voted illegally in 2016. Trump isn’t giving up on his quest to remove people from the voter rolls, the effort is just going underground. In his executive order disbanding the commission, Trump said its work would be handed over to the Department of Homeland Security. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the commission’s vice chair, described it as a “<a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article192854444.html\">tactical shift</a>.” He said officials from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/03/trump-disbands-voter-fraud-commission-322621\">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) would compare state voter rolls with federal immigration databases to search for non-citizens who are registered to vote.</p>\n<p>The prospect of DHS leading a new probe into voter fraud is raising alarm bells among voting rights groups, who warn it could lead to people being wrongly accused of fraud and purged from the voter rolls. “The report that this effort will now be moved over to the Department of Homeland Security is baffling,” says Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, which sent a <a href=\"https://lawyerscommittee.org/press-release/lawyers-committee-civil-rights-law-demands-information-sham-election-commission-communications-government-agencies/\">Freedom of Information Act request to DHS</a> in October requesting its dealings with Trump’s commission. “This was an agency that was set up to protect Americans from terrorism. Moving this commission over to DHS would be an abuse of the agency’s power.”</p>\n<p>ICE has scant experience in this area and the federal databases Kobach wants DHS to use, such as the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/23/kris-kobach/trumps-election-commission-chair-kris-kobach-says-/\">Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database</a>, are not designed for that purpose and do not automatically reveal the status of immigrants who become US citizens, which means thousands of noncitizens who are subsequently naturalized could mistakenly be tagged as illegal voters. Indeed, during the Obama administration<strong> </strong>DHS <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/oct/30/league-women-voters-florida/league-women-voters-says-homeland-security-warned-/\">warned states</a> about using the SAVE database to remove voters from the rolls.</p>\n<p>“Lags in updating databases once people attain citizenship plus poor matching procedures can dramatically inflate allegations of noncitizen voting, perhaps enough to please Trump,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/948761955099082753\">tweeted</a> University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund filed a <a href=\"http://www.naacpldf.org/files/about-us/LDF%20FOIA%20Request%20to%20DHS.pdf\">FOIA with DHS</a> on Wednesday seeking the extent of the department’s dealings with Trump’s commission, and in a <a href=\"http://www.naacpldf.org/files/case_issue/AS%20FILED%20LDF%20v.%20Trump%20Second%20Amended%20Complaint.pdf\">federal lawsuit</a> filed last fall the Legal Defense Fund noted<strong> </strong>that comparing federal non-citizen databases with state voter rolls “is not a reliable method to identify voter fraud, and it is likely to generate numerous false positives, with a disproportionate impact on voters of color.”</p>\n<p>The DHS probe will also be largely conducted out of the public eye, making it immune from the type of public scrutiny and oversight that doomed Trump’s commission. “To the extent that they are now hoping to conduct their activities shrouded in secrecy, that’s deeply troubling,” says Clarke. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Trump’s commission was doomed from the very beginning because of widespread public opposition to it. It was predicated on Trump’s false claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. When the commission was formed in May 2017, it was dominated not by respected election officials from both parties, but run by people like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html?_r=0\">Kobach</a>, who had a long history of pushing policies to restrict access to the ballot. Before the commission was formed, one of its eventual members, Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, wrote to the Justice Department that “mainstream Republican officials,” Democrats, and academics <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/trump-election-commissioner-sought-to-exclude-democrats-and-mainstream-republicans/\">should be excluded</a> from the commission. That’s largely what happened.</p>\n<p>The commission’s first major action—an unprecedented request for <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/trump-administrations-request-for-extensive-voter-data-raises-fears-of-suppression/\">sensitive voter data</a> from all fifty states, including Social Security numbers, voting history, and criminal records—sparked an unprecedented backlash from Republican and Democratic states alike. The Republican secretary of state of Mississippi <a href=\"http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/30/hosemann-voter-records/444623001/\">told Kobach</a> to “go jump in the Gulf of Mexico.” Not a single state provided all of the voter data Kobach asked for; <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/the-trump-administration-is-trying-again-to-get-data-on-every-american-voter/\">21 states</a> decided not to hand over any data to the commission. Groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the ACLU, and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights immediately sued, alleging a wide array of <a href=\"https://www.epic.org/privacy/litigation/voter/epic-v-commission/\">federal privacy and transparency violations</a>. The commission ultimately faced <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-is-being-sued-by-one-of-its-commissioners/\">15 federal and state lawsuits</a>.</p>\n<p>Kobach discussed his plans to request the sensitive voter data with <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/whos-really-in-charge-of-the-voting-fraud-commission\">two conservative activists</a> who were eventually appointed to the commission, von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, without informing the rest of the commission before he sent letters to all 50 states. That secrecy and lack of transparency proved par for the course; in November 2017, a Democratic member of the commission, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-is-being-sued-by-one-of-its-commissioners/\">sued the commission</a> itself, claiming he was being kept in the dark about its activities. Before Christmas, a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/22/trump-voter-fraud-committee-democrat-access-318433\">ruled in his favor</a>. That accelerated the commission’s demise. The commission neither found nor released any evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>\n<p>Despite the Trump administration’s disbanding of the commission, the president himself is still pushing the myth of widespread voter fraud and advocating policies that restrict the right to vote. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948874586006925313\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948872192284155904\">tweets</a> on Thursday morning, Trump maintained “many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D.” There is little evidence to support Trump’s claims. One major study found that there were only 31 credible <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">cases of voter impersonation</a> from 2000 to 2014 out of more than 1 billion votes cast. Voter ID laws, meanwhile, have been shown to block thousands of people from voting in states like Wisconsin, as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/voter-suppression-wisconsin-election-2016/\">Mother Jones has reported</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/a-new-study-shows-just-how-many-americans-were-blocked-from-voting-in-wisconsin-last-year/\">study by the University of Wisconsin</a> found that Wisconsin’s voter ID law blocked or deterred up to 23,000 people from voting in the 2016 election in Milwaukee County and Madison’s Dane County—and up to 45,000 people statewide—with African Americans three times as likely as whites to be deterred from voting by the law.</p>\n<p>Republican states are not likely to drop efforts to restrict access to the ballot, especially as they face the prospect of massive losses in 2018. Control of Congress in 2018, not to mention the presidential election in 2020, hinges in part on states like Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Virginia that have put <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/new-voting-restrictions-america\">new voting restrictions</a> in place in recent years. On Wednesday, the New Hampshire legislature passed a new bill that could prevent <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/new-hampshire-student-voting-312061e51f13/\">thousands of college students</a> from voting there.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The president ruined Molly Knight’s week and her podcast. Knight, a former writer for ESPN and<strong> </strong>author of <em>The Best Team Money Can Buy</em>, a book about the Los Angeles Dodgers, was in the middle of putting together a slice-of-life podcast when Donald Trump was elected. She surprised her 80,000 Twitter followers by going from tweeting about sports to ranting about Trump, and out of her anger came the podcast “The President Ruined My Week.”</p>\n<p>Even though the show, which features interviews with public figures and celebrities, was born out of political frustration, the conversations often veer away from Trump talk to topics as diverse as Knight’s guests. Case in point: Knight has so far talked with singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://toriamos.com/\">Tori Amos</a>, writer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ira?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Ira Madison III</a>, and actor and comedian <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0054697/\">Ike Barinholtz</a>, discussing everything from sexism in the music industry to the gay love story “Call Me By Your Name” to whether it would be better to be trapped in an elevator with Trump or Paul Ryan.</p>\n<p>In a media landscape stuffed to the gills with podcasts, particularly political ones, what makes “The President Ruined My Week” different? Knight said she wanted to create a podcast that doesn’t just react to the never-ending stream of bad news, but learns how people are dealing with it.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s hard to see how it’s affecting all of us so profoundly while we’re in it,” she said. “It’s like we’re in this fucking category 5 hurricane right now and we can’t survey the damage until it’s over. I want to create a space where people can talk about it.”</p>\n<p><em>Mother Jones</em> talked to Knight about the role sports have played in the resistance, what the podcast would have been called if Trump hadn’t been elected, and Taylor Swift’s political apathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother Jones: </strong>You started your career as a sportswriter, and your last big project was your book about the Dodgers. How did you end up being a Trump provocateur on Twitter?</p>\n<p><strong>Molly Knight:</strong> Friends of mine who write about sports will ask me if I was nervous about losing followers, because I would assume half or maybe more than half of the people who bought my baseball book lean conservative. That didn’t ever cross my mind. I started tweeting about Trump because it was right versus wrong. It wasn’t like a calculated branding decision, it was just how I felt. I’m just really passionate, it turns out, about trying to stop fascism. God bless those who want me to stick to baseball. It’s not happening.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>What was the turning point for you? Was there a specific moment that caused that shift?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> I went through this point last fall after he won where I didn’t think writing about sports mattered anymore. Basically every assignment that was offered to me I turned down, because I was just like, “I don’t care. I don’t care about this person’s new shoe line, I don’t care about how well this team is doing, I don’t care about this actress’s superhero movie.” I just couldn’t wrap my brain around the enormity of what was happening.</p>\n<aside>Trump’s election has been terrible,  but it also offered clarity about what matters.</aside>\n<p>Then after a while, I realized, “Wait, these athletes are on the frontline of resistance.” Liberals will watch MSNBC, and conservatives will watch Fox, and I guess people who I don’t know will watch CNN <em>[laughs]</em>, so you’re just in your own echo chamber. The only time that we as a country will watch something together is for sports. So for athletes to denounce Trump or wear “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts, or with Colin Kaepernick taking a knee to protest police brutality against people of color, it was beautiful because everyone had to see it. It was on MSNBC, it was on Fox and CBS and NFL Network and ESPN and it was everywhere. I thought, “Man, I had this all wrong.”</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>What was the genesis of the podcast?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> So the podcast had been in the works for a year and a half, and originally it was just going to be a podcast called, “What’s It Like to Be You?” This was pre-Trump, and I was going to be interviewing different people—from celebrities to schoolteachers, air traffic controllers, and janitors—just to get a sense of what their daily lives are like. I even recorded a couple of test episodes with a few celebrities. And then Trump won.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to figure out how it could be different than other political podcasts. There are a lot of podcasts that run through the news and react and react and react, but what I found was when I was going to dinner with friends, everyone’s just in this weird state of, “I just cannot believe what is going on.”</p>\n<p>I think there needs to be a larger conversation about how everyone is kind of losing it right now and feeling stressed. People are feeling more and more isolated. I don’t want people to feel alone. People can listen to the podcast and feel like they’re not crazy. Trump’s election has been terrible in a lot of ways, but it has also offered quite a bit of clarity about what matters.</p>\n<aside>God bless those who want me to stick to baseball. It’s not happening.</aside>\n<p><b>MJ: </b>What podcasts do you listen to? Are you modeling this off of anything in particular?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> I’m not modeling it off of anything in particular. I’m a journalist, and there are a lot of political podcasts right now by people who are not journalists. I will listen to interviews with, quote unquote, big names and just feel like, “God, what a wasted opportunity.” But they bring their own expertise. I really enjoy listening to “Pod Save America,” because these guys worked in the White House.</p>\n<p>If I were to get a sitting senator on the podcast, which I’m working on doing [Knight later confirmed at least one senator will be on the show this month], I’m not necessarily going to be focused on policy. It’ll be more focused on them and their day and how they cope with what’s going on and what their take on everything is and what people are saying to them. Do they, like, bicker with their Republican colleagues all day and then go to dinner with them at night? Who are their besties in the Senate? Just kind of humanizing people.</p>\n<p>God, I sound so pompous, but human emotion and the human condition is what interests me more than anything else as a writer. I’m just interested in talking to people about how their lives have changed during a white nationalist presidency.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>What kind of guests do you have lined up? Can you give us any hints?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> I can’t give specific names because some of them are still being set up. I’m working on a prominent female senator and there are only like 18 of those, so that’s as big of a hint as you’re going to get.</p>\n<p>There will be white men, funny, brilliant, woke white men on the show, but I’m interested in elevating voices that haven’t been heard from enough, so I’m guessing that it will probably skew more to female, women of color, men of color, gay people, transgender people. I want to hear from people who have not been heard from.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>Are you planning on only focusing on celebrities and public figures?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> No. Part of the reason to do that is obviously because celebrities and public figures have bigger followings, and so when you’re trying to get something off the ground, you want to try to lead with the biggest names you can get. But no, if this goes the way that I hope it will go, it will be a mix of famous people and non-famous people. It’s just in its nascent form right now, so we’ll see how it all shakes out.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>How did you come up with the title? Was there a week in particular this year that Trump ruined for you?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> Like every week [<em>laughs]</em>. We bandied about a bunch of different options, and that was the one that stood out. There has been some misconception that it’s just going to be a bitch-fest, which it’s not. I want to talk to people who are still trucking and still creating and still working and still functioning and are still having a voice. The other side of that group would be Taylor Swift. I guess it was her birthday recently, and she didn’t really think this was a political statement, but she <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8070516/taylor-swift-reflects-2017-couldnt-have-asked-for-a-better-year?utm_source=twitter\">said</a>, “This has been the best year,” and I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/molly_knight/status/941366063421210624\">said</a> something like, “Wow the weather must be nice on Earth 2.” You want to find the balance between being outraged all day long and your work and being Taylor Swift in a hermetically sealed bubble.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>In your first episode, with Tori Amos, you talk gender. In your second episode with Ira Madison III, you talk race. As a white woman, how do you strike that balance between talking about how the Trump administration has affected you and how it has affected or will affect people of color and other marginalized groups?</p>\n<p><strong>MK:</strong> For me, rather than find it threatening, I actually find it comforting to mention there’s stuff that I just don’t know. Like I said with Ira, which some people might have just been like, duh, but I said I understood that there was virulent racism in this country and systemic racism in terms of job opportunities and horrible challenges that people of color face. What I did not understand was that so many people would vote for Trump and shared his views. I thought he was going to be roundly rejected. Frankly, it was naive on my part.</p>\n<p>All I can do is talk about my own experiences. As a sportswriter, I was, if not the only female in the locker room, then one of them. And when certain things would happen to me I wouldn’t let myself think that it was because I was a woman. I would have gone crazy. I think I was just in denial for a long time about how hard it was. I think the one thing the Trump election has done is we are no longer in denial about things. We can’t be anymore, because it’s just right there.</p>",

It was measles, and over the next several weeks the disease spread to at least <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6439a8.htm\" target=\"_blank\">136</a> Californians, as well as people in seven other states and two foreign countries.</p>\n<p>This was no fluke case. Though measles was supposedly eliminated in the United States in 2000—thanks to the highly effective measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR)—it has come roaring back, with <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html\" target=\"_blank\">667</a> confirmed cases nationwide in 2014 alone.</p>\n<p>Among the California patients in the Disney outbreak, at least 36 percent hadn’t received their MMR vaccine. Some were too young to have gotten their shots, but more than half were unvaccinated by choice. Despite school requirements, it was easy to skip immunizations: All parents had to do was sign <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.inspireschools.org/Immun.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a form</a> stating that “immunization is contrary to my beliefs.” From 1996 to 2014, the rate of kindergartners with personal-belief exemptions more than quintupled. And this wasn’t just a California phenomenon: <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/16/nearly-all-states-allow-religious-exemptions-for-vaccinations/\" target=\"_blank\">47</a> states allow religious or personal-belief exemptions.</p>\n<p>But California is no longer among them. The Disney outbreak propelled state lawmakers to pass SB 277, which eliminated the personal-belief exemption. It has been an immunological home run: In the 2016-17 school year, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/2016-17KindergartenSummaryReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">95.6 percent</a> of Californian kindergartners received all their required vaccinations, the highest rate since current immunization requirements began in 2001.</p>\n<aside>While the number of personal-belief exemptions has plummeted, medical exemptions—which require the signature of a licensed physician—have risen.</aside>\n<p>But while the number of personal-belief exemptions has plummeted, medical exemptions—which require the signature of a licensed physician—have risen. Writing in the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2652640\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Journal of the American Medical</em> <em>Association</em> in September</a>, researchers found that over the last two school years, the rate of permanent medical exemptions for kindergartners tripled. The rate, which had hovered around 0.15 percent for nearly two decades, is now 0.51 percent.</p>\n<p>Half of 1 percent might not seem like much, but it isn’t evenly <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://immunizations.aap.org/\" target=\"_blank\">distributed</a>. In more than two dozen public schools across the state—almost all of them charter schools—more than 10 percent of students in <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/2016-17KindergartenData.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">kindergarten</a> or <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/2016-17CA7thGradeData.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">seventh</a> grade (another year when the state surveys) had a permanent medical exemption, or PME, last school year. Yuba River Charter School, about an hour’s drive west of Lake Tahoe in rural Nevada City, had PMEs for 16 percent of kindergartners and 30 percent of seventh-graders. SunRidge School in Sebastopol, a town in Sonoma County, had PME rates of 39 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The previous year, neither school had any medical exemptions. Their vaccination rates are <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/country_profiles/Haiti/immunization_country_profiles/immunization_hti.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">comparable</a> to Haiti’s.</p>\n<p>Fueling this spike in medical exemptions is an industry of doctors willing—and sometimes eager—to flout the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the name of “parent choice.” Led by Orange County pediatrician Bob Sears, author of the influential <em>The </em><em>Vaccine Book</em> and son of pediatrician and attachment parenting guru Bill Sears, many physicians are wary of the CDC’s vaccination schedule, believing that giving kids too many vaccines at once may be dangerous. (In 2013, the Institute of Medicine found no evidence that the schedule was unsafe.) The doctors are supported by a movement of anti-vaccine parents, many of whom believe the MMR vaccine causes autism. That view is rooted in a 1998 paper that was later retracted by <em>The Lancet</em> and declared “<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.bmj.com/press-releases/2012/06/26/bmj-declares-mmr-study-%E2%80%9C-elaborate-fraud%E2%80%9D-autism-claims-likened-%E2%80%9Cpiltdown-\" target=\"_blank\">an elaborate fraud</a>” by the <em>British Medical Journal</em>.</p>\n<p>But the damage has been done. In 2015, soon after SB 277 was passed, a California-based nonprofit popped up called <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org\" target=\"_blank\">Physicians for Informed Consent</a> (PIC). A coalition of about 200 doctors, scientists, and attorneys who vehemently oppose mandatory vaccine laws, it boasts Sears as a founding member. Meanwhile, Sears is currently facing charges of gross negligence from California’s medical board. The board has <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www2.mbc.ca.gov/PDL/document.aspx?path=%5CDIDOCS%5C20160909%5CDMRAAAFC12%5C&did=AAAFC160909210940460.DID&licenseType=A&licenseNumber=60936\" target=\"_blank\">alleged</a> that when granting a medical exemption for a two-year-old, Sears failed to obtain the patient’s medical history and other necessary information. Depending on which way the board rules, Sears could have his license revoked. (Sears declined to comment on his case.)</p>\n<p>PIC’s membership is confidential, but its list of founding members and board members is public. I called many of those doctors’ offices and asked what I would need to do to secure a medical exemption. One clinic outside Los Angeles said I would just have to complete a genetic test. When I asked which conditions merited an exemption, some offices said there was a long list of conditions that would qualify; one office assistant said her thyroid problem had secured a medical exemption for her kid.</p>\n<aside>“There really are not specific genetic markers for telling us when patients are going to have adverse events associated with vaccines,” a Vanderbilt professor of pediatrics said.</aside>\n<p>According to Kathryn Edwards, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, using such tests is not “scientifically sound.” She adds, “There really are not specific genetic markers for telling us when patients are going to have adverse events associated with vaccines.” Shira Miller, PIC’s president, wrote to me in an email that her organization strives to make sure its doctors give medical exemptions “in accordance with California law.”</p>\n<p>To be sure, there are medical conditions that do merit an exemption. Children whose immune systems are compromised might not be able to handle vaccines. But, by Edwards’ estimate, kids with a legitimate need for a medical exemption account for just 1 percent of the population—tops. There’s no way that 10 or 25 percent of kindergartners in a single school have a valid reason.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want children to get vaccines who shouldn’t be getting vaccines,” says Edwards, but “I’ve stood at the bed of children who are dying. I know that if there was a vaccine that could have prevented that, the family would have wanted that.”</p>",

But the most interesting part, I thought, was the editor’s note at the end:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Wolff says, <strong>he was able to take up “something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing” — an idea encouraged by the president himself.</strong> Because no one was in a position to either officially approve or formally deny such access, Wolff became “more a constant interloper than an invited guest.” There were no ground rules placed on his access, and he was required to make no promises about how he would report on what he witnessed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This sort of arrangement is fairly common in presidential campaigns. But it’s not common in presidential <em>administrations</em>. Not even slightly. I’m not at all sure it’s ever been done before.</p>\n<p>But apparently Trump is such an insane narcissist that he couldn’t see any downside to this. He simply couldn’t conceive that unrestricted access would produce anything other than a glowing tribute to the most sensational first 100 days of any presidency ever. That’s despite the fact that he’s done this many times before and the results have never been favorable except in a “say anything you want as long as you spell my name right” kind of way.</p>\n<p>There’s really no mystery about Trump. He’s exactly what he seems to be. The only reason we keep regurgitating stories like this one is because we can’t collectively believe it.

They’re wrong—the frigid temperatures might actually be <em>because</em> of global warming.</p>\n<p>In 2016, <em><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/12/polar-vortex-donald-trump-climate-change/\">Mother Jones</a></em> reported on Rutgers researcher Jennifer Francis and other scientists who believe that global warming is playing a role in extreme cold snaps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To understand how it works, it first helps to think of the jet stream as a river of air that flows from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing with it much of our weather. Its motion—sometimes in a relatively straight path, sometimes in a more loopy one—is driven by a difference in temperatures between the equator and the North Pole. Southern temperatures are of course warmer, and because warm air takes up more space than cold air, this leads to taller columns of air in the atmosphere. “If you were sitting on top of a layer of atmosphere and you were in DC, looking northward, it would be like looking down a hill, because it’s warmer where you are,” explains Francis. The jet stream then flows “downhill,” so to speak, in a northward direction. But it’s also bent by the rotation of the Earth, leading to its continual wavy, eastward motion. As the Arctic rapidly heats up, however, there’s less of a temperature difference between the equator and the poles, and the downhill slope in the atmosphere is accordingly less steep.</p>\n<p>That shrinking temperature difference is what wreaks havoc on the jet stream. “When the jet stream gets weaker, it meanders more,” explained Francis in an interview this week. “It wanders north and south and when it gets into one of these wandering and wavy patterns, that’s when we see these pools of cold air pulled southward.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s also important to remember that weather and climate are two different things. As the <a href=\"http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/csd/graphics/content/outreach/brochures/Weather&amp;Climate_General_Public.pdf\">National Weather Service</a> puts it, “Weather is what you get, climate is what you expect.” The daily temperature is weather, but the averages of those temperatures over a long period of  time is climate. So even though much of the country finished out 2017 with record-breaking temperatures, it was still the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/02/2017-was-the-hottest-year-on-record-without-an-el-nino-thanks-to-global-warming\">second hottest year</a> on record. The clear, long-term trends are far more important than the snow Tallahassee residents are seeing outside today.</p>",
