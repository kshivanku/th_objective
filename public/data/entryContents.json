Most countries consider as illegal the<span> Israel</span>i settlements built in the territory which<span> Israel </span>captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>\n<p><span>Israel </span>disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>\n<p><span>Israel</span>i authorities were due to<span> approve </span>on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.</p>\n<p>There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian officials. The Palestinians say<span> Israel</span>i settlements in the<span> West </span><span>bank</span>, a key issue in peace talks, deny them a viable contiguous state.</p>\n<p>US-brokered peace talks between<span> Israel </span>and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by US President Donald Trump’s administration to restart them have shown little sign of progress.</p>\n<p>Asked about the construction plans, a US State Department official said there had been no change in policy on settlements and the<span> Israel</span>i government had made clear that going forward “its intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the president’s concerns into consideration.”</p>\n<p>“The US welcomes this. As the president has said repeatedly, the administration is firmly committed to pursuing a comprehensive peace between<span> Israel</span>is and Palestinians,” the US official said on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>The White House said on Monday US vice president Mike Pence will visit the region from January 20 to 23, embarking on a tour originally planned for December after Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of<span> Israel</span>.</p>\n<p>Pence will hold talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Jordan’s King Abdullah and <span>Israel</span>i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.</p>\n<p>Trump’s decision on Jerusalem and announcement in December that the US would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv enraged the Palestinians who said the US can no longer broker peace with<span> Israel</span>.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212416/israel-approve-hundreds-new-settler-homes-west-bank/\">Israel to Approve Hundreds of New Settler Homes in West Bank</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",
