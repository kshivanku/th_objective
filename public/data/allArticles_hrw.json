Authorities should immediately free Titiev, drop the charges against him, and stop hindering the work of human rights advocates in Chechnya, the international human rights groups said.</p>\n<p>“Titiev’s arrest is a clear signal that authorities in Chechnya are trying to force Memorial out of Chechnya, which is an affront to everyone there who needs protection from human rights abuses,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/hugh-williamson\">Hugh Williamson</a>, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Titiev should not be in custody, where we fear his health and safety are at risk.”</p>\n<p>Police arrested Titiev, 60, at approximately 10:30 a.m. on January 9, 2018, near Kurchaloi, a town 30 miles from Grozny, the Chechen capital. One of Titiev’s friends told Memorial that he saw Titiev standing by his car on a local road near the Khumyk river bridge, surrounded by five or six police officers. The same witness said that when he later went to the Kurchaloi police department to look for Titiev, he saw his friend’s car parked outside.</p>\n<p>A lawyer sent by Memorial went to the police station in the early afternoon, but police officials did not acknowledge Titiev was in custody and did not let him in. In the early evening, Chechnya’s deputy interior minister informed Russia’s federal ombudsperson, in response to her inquiry, that Kurchaloi police had detained Titiev. The lawyer was then admitted to the station.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia\">Russian</a> law provides that authorities can hold a person for up to three hours before formally placing them in custody, but the detainee is entitled to access to a lawyer as soon as they are detained. Titiev had access to his lawyer only after almost seven hours, and when the authorities issued the official report registering his detention, they listed the time of detention as 8.10 p.m., approximately 10 hours after he was first in their custody.</p>\n<p>“The detaining authorities refused to provide any information about his whereabouts and fate for close to seven hours, in violation of international due process standards, raising a real concern that they may have been trying to forcibly disappear him,” said Andrew Anderson, director at Front Line Defenders.</p>\n<p>“Russia has an obligation under international human rights law to immediately register and acknowledge all detentions, and allow detainees access to their lawyers, a fundamental safeguard against ill treatment and enforced disappearances,” said Denis Krivosheev, head of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regional Office at Amnesty International.</p>\n<p>The police told the lawyer they had allegedly found <a href=\"https://95.xn--b1aew.xn--p1ai/news/item/11988057/\">180 grams of a marijuana-like substance</a> in a bag in Titiev’s car and that Titiev was under investigation for possession of an illegal drug. Titiev denied the allegations and insisted the bag had been planted by police. If convicted, Titiev faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The human rights advisor to Russia’s president, Mikhail Fedotov <a href=\"http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/4862846\">told the press</a>, that Titiev’s case may constitute a fabrication and the investigation authorities should look into the issue.</p>\n<p>The rights groups called on Moscow to ensure that Titiev is immediately released, that there are no further threats to his security, and that human rights groups can carry out their work in Chechnya safely. Nils Muižnieks, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CommissionerHR/?hc_ref=ARSW_kVhIZYn7N3W1-khNRpl7LgcsQYgFEcb7-5rOwOetv2VtQ7vdq8jhbNRRyQ6pdw&fref=nf\">, issued a statement</a> expressing concern about Titiev’s arrest, questioning the “dubious charges that lack credibility” and calling on Russian authorities to immediately ensure his release.</p>\n<p>Russia’s international partners should follow Muižnieks’ example and publicly express their objection to this attempt to silence Memorial and urge the Kremlin to secure Titiev’s immediate release and continued safety.</p>\n<p>“Bogus drug-related charges and planted evidence are a regular tactic that Chechen authorities have used to punish and discredit their critics,” said FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture in the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2014, a court in Chechnya sentenced local activist Ruslan Kutaev to four years in prison on fabricated, politically motivated drug charges after he criticized and disobeyed an order by Chechnya’s leader, President Ramzan Kadyrov. Kutaev was paroled in December 2017. In 2016, another Chechen court sentenced journalist Zhalaudi Geriev to three years in prison on similarly fabricated drug charges. Geriev reported for <em>Caucasian Knot</em>, an online outlet that reports extensively on Chechnya and that has criticized Chechnya’s leadership.</p>\n<p>Memorial has monitored abuses in Chechnya for more than 25 years, reporting extensively first on abuses by federal forces during the two Chechen wars, and then on violations carried out by local authorities with the Kremlin’s tacit blessing.During the past 10 years of Kadyrov’s rule in Chechnya, Memorial has published hard-hitting exposés on collective punishment practices, enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment, punitive house burnings, and extrajudicial killing by local security officials. They have consistently described contemporary Chechnya as a totalitarian enclave within Russia, noting Kadyrov’s interference in virtually all aspects of social life, including politics, religion, academic discourse, and family matters.</p>\n<p>Titiev has led Memorial’s work in Chechnya since 2009, after <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/15/russia-leading-chechnya-rights-activist-murdered\">the kidnapping and murder of his colleague</a> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/18/killings-prelude-and-aftermath\">Natalia Estemirova</a>. His arrest follows years of threats and smear campaigns by Chechnya’s authorities against Memorial and other human rights groups. Kadyrov and other Chechen public officials routinely vilify human rights defenders as “puppets of the West” and “enemies of Russia” bent on destabilizing Chechnya. Some activists also suffered attacks and harassment by local security officials or pro-government thugs.</p>\n<p>The most recent smear came in December 2017 from Magomed Daudov, speaker of Chechnya’s parliament and Kadyrov’s right hand man, after Kadyrov was included as a target for US sanctions under the US Magnitsky Act and his Instagram account was blocked. Daudov <a href=\"https://chechnyatoday.com/content/view/309926\">accused human rights defenders</a> of “running to their boss across the ocean and pouring rivers of lies” and said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if they were involved in other subversion aimed at weakening our state….I think it’s time to send our enemies, those who don’t like a strong Russia, [out of the country] to their foreign bosses or to isolate them from polite society. …If only Russia hadn’t had a moratorium [on the death penalty], we could’ve just bid these enemies of the people ‘salaam alekum’ and be done with them.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that Chechen authorities have so blatantly invented drug accusations against Titiev is not surprising, in light of the vicious way they persistently target people brave enough to try to speak up about human rights abuses,” said Bjørn Engesland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Helsinki Committee. “The question is,what will Russia’s federal authorities do about it and whether Russia’s international partners will do their utmost to ensure Moscow does the right thing?”</p>",

Perhaps the most striking aspect of this conflict is the little done to protect civilians.</p>\n<p>Take Idlib. Despite being a “de-escalation zone” where a ceasefire should be in place, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/31/russia/syria-deadly-airstrikes-trapped-civilians\">recent offensive is not the first time Idlib governorate – which is controlled by extremist group Hay’et Tahrir Al-Sham – has been subject to relentless attacks</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/22/syria-talks-focus-protecting-civilians\">world however has remained largely silent, about the risk to civilians there</a>, conveniently forgetting that an <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/latest_developments_in_north_western_syria_20180103.pdf\">estimated 2.65 million people are trapped in North-western Syria</a>.

The besieged Damascus suburb is held by anti-government groups and was the site of the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/10/syria-government-likely-culprit-chemical-attack\">worst chemical attack</a> in the conflict. There too, the Syrian government and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia\">Russia</a> are <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/22/syria/russia-airstrikes-siege-killing-civilians\">regularly bombing schools, hospitals, and homes while refusing to allow much-needed aid in</a>.

These <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/syria#4be392\">indiscriminate airstrikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/01/death-chemicals/syrian-governments-widespread-and-systematic-use-chemical-weapons\">chemical weapon use</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/15/syria-civilians-stranded-isis-area\">other atrocities have battered both the population and the guiding principle that civilians are to be protected during war</a>.

Iranian authorities should ensure that all deaths in detention and allegations of ill-treatment are swiftly and independently investigated, and that anyone responsible is brought to justice.</p>\n<div data-type=\"image\">\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/313147\">\n<img alt=\"Announcement of Vahid Heidari’s death, 2017. © Private\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801mena_iran_vahid_heidari.jpg?itok=kQ-7iACs 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801mena_iran_vahid_heidari.jpg?itok=VvThe_v9 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801mena_iran_vahid_heidari.jpg?itok=5H6tGuhW 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/946w/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801mena_iran_vahid_heidari.jpg?itok=1HerOhgS 946w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801mena_iran_vahid_heidari.jpg?itok=3s_5p_xI 960w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801mena_iran_vahid_heidari.jpg?itok=E8R5-uQ2\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/313147\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p>Announcement of Vahid Heidari’s death, 2017. </p>\n</span>\n<span>© Private</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>On January 7, a <a href=\"https://t.me/Bazdashtha96\">committee of Iranian activists</a> established to document and monitor arrests during the 2017-2018 protests reported that Sina Ghanbari, a 23-year-old man from Tehran, died in the “quarantine” ward of Evin prison in Tehran under “unknown circumstances.” On January 5, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reported that Vahid Heidari, a protester arrested in Arak, Markazi province, <a href=\"https://persian.iranhumanrights.org/1396/10/valid-heidari-prison-death-iran-protests/\">had died under unknown circumstances</a> in detention and had been buried that day.</p>\n<p>“The reports of deaths make it critically important to investigate these cases immediately and to bring anyone responsible for ill-treatment to justice,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson\">Sarah Leah Whitson</a>, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “The legacy of Kahrizak prison, where the 2009 protesters were tortured and killed, and persistent impunity for these crimes, casts a dark shadow on the situation for people arrested since these protests began.”</p>\n<p>On January 8, two members of the Iranian parliament and the head of Tehran’s prisons confirmed the death of Ghanbari, in Evin prison in Tehran<span dir=\"RTL\">.</span> Tayebeh Siavoshi, a parliament member from Tehran, <a href=\"http://www.ilna.ir/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-3/579694-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B6%DB%8C%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%86\">told the <em>Iranian Labor News Agency</em> (ILNA)</a> that when she asked the Intelligence Ministry about Ghanbari’s death, authorities told her that police arrested Ghanbari and handed him over to judicial authorities, and that he committed suicide while in detention.

He added that Heidari’s family was told that their son was addicted to drugs and committed suicide in prison. “The people who saw the body told us that there were cuts and bruises on the left side of his forehead that could be a sign of being beaten by a baton.” Najadi said. “I have received numerous reports from people who were detained by authorities that they harshly beat them during their arrest and detention in Arak.”</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the 2009 presidential elections, three detainees arrested for their role in protests – Amir Javadifar, Mohammad Kamrani, and Mohsen Ruholamini – died at <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/01/13/iran-prosecute-mortazavi-detention-deaths\">Kahrizak detention center</a>, outside Tehran, which was operated by Iran’s Law Enforcement Forces. In 2010, the victims’ families and rights activists reported that two other detainees, Ramin Aghazadeh Ghahremani and Abbas Nejati-Kargar, died after their release from the facility, allegedly due to injuries suffered there. Authorities have refused to link their deaths to injuries at Kahrizak.</p>\n<p>On January 10, 2010, a parliamentary panel investigating detentions after the disputed 2009 presidential election determined that Saeed Mortazavi, the former Tehran prosecutor general, was directly responsible for the ill-treatment of detainees in Kahrizak Prison. On November 26, 2017, the Appeals Court of Tehran sentenced Mortazavi <a href=\"https://www.mehrnews.com/news/4155985/%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%DA%A9%D9%87%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DA%A9-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%88-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%B4%D8%AF\">to two years in prison</a> for complicity in Ruholamini’s murder.</p>\n<p>On January 9, Sadeghi, the parliament member, <a href=\"http://donya-e-eqtesad.com/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-62/3338361-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%B1\">told <em>Khaneh Mellat</em> news agency</a> that authorities arrested 3,700 people during the protests that started on December 28 in Mashhad and spread across the country. He also estimated the total number of students arrested by authorities to be between 40 and 68. But earlier accounts estimated that a larger number of students had been detained, including dozens of student activists and members of university student groups.</p>\n<p>On January 5, Parvaneh Salahshoori, a member of Parliament from Tehran, told <a href=\"https://t.me/jameeno\">Jame’e No Telegram channel</a> that more than 90 students have been arrested, most likely by the Intelligence Ministry. On the same day, Sadeghi also <a href=\"http://sharghdaily.ir/News/149755/\">told <em>Shargh</em> newspaper</a> that 55 students had been arrested in Tehran alone. Human rights groups have <a href=\"https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2018/01/iranian-security-forces-have-arrested-more-than-40-university-students-these-are-their-names/\">identified 40 arrested students</a>, including student activists.</p>\n<p>On January 8, Shokoufeh Yadollahi, mother of Kasra Nouri, a university student and a member of Gonabadi Dervish community who was detained in Evin prison for ten days, told Human Rights Watch that intelligence authorities did not provide an arrest warrant when they arrested Nouri and three of his friends, Mohammad Sharifi Moghadam, Mohammad Reza Darvish, and Faezeh Abdipour, at the Dey Hospital in Tehran where they were visiting a family friend who was hospitalized, on December 30.</p>\n<p>Yadollahi said that witnesses told the family when the students resisted arrest without a warrant, a plain clothes official told security forces to beat the detainees, which they did. Yadollahi said her son was in ward 209 of Evin prison and has not had access to a lawyer. On January 9, Majzooban news website reported that authorities released Nouri, Sharifi Moghadam, Darvish and Abdipour from prison.</p>\n<p>On January 5, Seyed Farid Mousavi, another Tehran member of Parliament, tweeted that when he followed up on the arrests of students with authorities, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sfaridmousavi/status/949361610681921538\">he was told that most of the arrests were “preventive”</a> and that the students would be released soon.</p>\n<p>On January 3, Mohammad Aghazadeh, a veteran journalist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aghazadeh811/status/948806565716357121\">tweeted that authorities arrested his son Soheil Aghazadeh</a>, a University of Tehran student, at his home, though he had not participated in the protests.</p>\n<p>Several members of parliament have announced that they are looking into the situation for detainees, particularly students. On January 7, Nahid Khodabakhsi, a member of the Tehran City council, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/N_Khodakarami/status/949950497087213568\">tweeted that she has asked the council</a> to invite the families of detainees to attend a city council session. On January 7, Masoumeh Ebtekar, Iran’s vice president for women and family affairs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ebtekarm_ir/status/950210705013248000\">tweeted that President Rouhani insisted during a cabinet meeting</a> on the release of all university students</p>\n<p>On January 9, Bahram Parsai, the spokesperson for the parliamentary commission on citizens’ rights, <a href=\"https://www.isna.ir/news/96101910183/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%86\">told <em>Iranians Student News Agency </em>(ISNA)</a> that the commission has submitted an official request to the Justice Ministry to visit prisons, including Evin, without clarifying whether the request is related to recent incidents. Authorities have not established any formal inquiries into the alleged unlawful use of force and the circumstances that led to the deaths of at least 21 people in relation to the protests, as well as the mass arrests across the country.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch compiled reports of arrests and releases through January 8, based on separate official announcements as reported in the news media. Out of 1,858 announced arrests, the authorities had announced the release of 356 but the total number of those currently detained is unknown. Family members of detainees have gathered in front of Evin prison in Tehran in hope of getting news about their loved ones.</p>\n<p>On January 9, Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent human rights lawyer, told Human Rights Watch that several families at Evin told her that after news about Ghanbari’s death, they are extremely concerned about the wellbeing of their loved ones.</p>\n<p>With a history of persistent impunity and a dismal record of investigating abuses, Iran should allow Iranian and foreign independent investigators including the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran to visit detention centers and investigate the alleged abuses, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>“The judiciary should immediately and unconditionally release anyone solely arrested for peaceful dissent and ensure fair trials and due process rights for those charged with a recognizable crime,” Whitson said. “Either parliament members or the president who claim to support the right to peaceful assembly should establish an official inquiry and provide clear answers to the victims and their families.”</p>\n<p><strong>Arrests Confirmed by Officials:</strong></p>\n<table

In recent years, he received many threats aimed at making him quit human rights work. Now, his life and safety are in jeopardy. Seven hours after his arrest, Chechnya’s interior ministry confirmed they took him into custody, allegedly on suspicion of a drug-related crime.</p>\n<p>At about 10:30 a.m. a witness saw five to six police officials stop and search Titiev’s car by the Khumyk river bridge, not far from the town of Kurchaloi. The officials then took Titiev to the Kurchaloi district police department. When a lawyer from Memorial arrived at the police department that afternoon, an officer refused to let him in, claiming Titiev wasn’t on the premises. Another police officer, however, admitted off the record that they had Titiev in custody. At about 5 p.m., Chechnya’s deputy interior minister informed Russia’s federal ombudsperson, in response to her inquiry, that Kurchaoi police had detained Titiev. Around that time, Titiev’s lawyer was admitted to the station, and local police told him his client was being charged with unlawful drug possession.</p>\n<p>Framing people for drug crimes has become an increasingly frequent tactic used by Chechnya’s authorities to punish and discredit their critics in the eyes of conservative Chechen society. In summer 2014, a court in Chechnya sentenced local activist Ruslan Kutaev to four years in jail on fabricated, politically motivated drug charges after he criticized and disobeyed an order by Chechnya’s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. In fall 2016, another Chechen court sentenced journalist Zhalaudi Geriev to three years in prison on similarly fraudulent drug charges. Geriev worked for the Caucasian Knot, a Russian media portal which was critical of Chechnya’s leadership and had covered Kutaev’s case. Both men were tortured in police custody. Kutaev was released on parole at the end of 2017. Geriev remains behind bars.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Kadyrov has often publicly <a>smeared and threatened </a>rights activists, and some of those activists also suffered attacks and harassment by local security officials or pro-government thugs. There’s no doubt that Titiev’s arrest is an attempt to finally push Memorial – which has been extensively reporting on collective punishment practices, enforced disappearances, torture, punitive house burnings, and other abuses by local authorities – out of Chechnya.</p>\n<p>Russia’s international partners should publicly express their indignation over this disgraceful attempt at silencing Memorial Moscow and urge the Kremlin to ensure Titiev’s immediate release and continued safety and security.</p>",

Most recently, Russia <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-united-nations.html\">vetoed</a> renewing a joint investigation of the UN and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), whose job it was to identify the culprits behind <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/07/un-security-council-remember-why-chemical-weapons-are-banned\">chemical attacks</a>.</p>\n<p>The UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) had accused both the Syrian government and Islamic State (also known as ISIS) of repeatedly using illegal chemical agents. In October, the JIM found the Syrian government responsible for the April 2017 sarin gas attack at <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/01/syria-new-evidence-shows-pattern-nerve-agent-use\">Khan Sheikhoun</a> that killed dozens, mostly women and children. This echoed Human Rights Watch’s findings.</p>\n<p>Russia has in the past taken positive steps urging Syria to change. In 2013, Russia helped pressure Syria to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention and begin dismantling its chemical weapons program, and Moscow played a key role in establishing the JIM in 2015. But this time around, Moscow has helped Syria’s government evade responsibility for Khan Sheikhoun, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/24/russia-muddies-waters-chemical-attacks-syria\">alleging that</a> armed groups carried out the attack themselves but offering little evidence to support this claim.</p>\n<p>The Russian government should change course, and support UN Security Council in holding those responsible for chemical attacks accountable. Even if it does not, UN members should continue to fund <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/12/21/syria-un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution-war-crimes-investigations\">other UN investigative teams</a> established to investigate crimes in Syria and ferret out those responsible for the chemical attacks.</p>\n<p>If perpetrators know that evidence of their crimes is being gathered for future prosecution, that may make them think twice before launching another bomb filled with sarin.  </p>",

Such scrutiny can deter misconduct, since judges normally bar illegally obtained evidence from trial.</p>\n<p>“Covering up how evidence was originally found deliberately hoodwinks defendants and judges, severely weakening constitutional fair trial rights,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-stvincent\">Sarah St.Vincent</a>, researcher on US surveillance at Human Rights Watch. “If the government is allowed to violate the US Constitution’s protections and then cover its tracks, this could undermine human rights for people whose liberty is at stake, or anyone else subjected to illegal government surveillance or other unlawful procedures.”</p>\n<p>The report is based on records from 95 US federal and state criminal cases, analyses of executive branch documents, and 24 interviews with defense attorneys, current and former US officials, and other people with specialized knowledge about the potential deliberate concealment of investigative methods in this manner and the consequences for rights.\n<div>\n<article data-eq-pts=\"large: 728\">\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<h2> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/08/interview-when-us-government-hides-evidence\">\nInterview: When the US Government Hides Evidence </a>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Researcher Sarah St.Vincent talks about her new report with Amy Braunschweiger, detailing the danger parallel construction creates for everyone in the US and why it needs to stop.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/08/interview-when-us-government-hides-evidence\">READ MORE</a> </div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n\n<p>Human Rights Watch identified evidence suggesting that US authorities use a range of tactics to create a new story about how an investigation began in order to avoid revealing how information was originally found. The most widely known is commonly described by law enforcement as a “wall stop” or “whisper stop.” Under this practice, a law enforcement or intelligence agency, possibly using information obtained by various forms of surveillance, asks state or local police to find a pretext – often a minor traffic violation – to stop a suspect and then develop a reason to search their vehicle.</p>\n<p>The Special Operations Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration may be extensively involved in passing tips to law enforcement entities, which may then engage in the practice of parallel construction to prevent those tips or the other sources underlying them from being revealed in court. The Special Operations Division and other federal bodies could be using parallel construction techniques frequently and routinely, Human Rights Watch found.</p>\n<p>These concealment methods could be used to prevent the disclosure of techniques such as warrantless surveillance under intelligence authorities such as <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/14/q-us-warrantless-surveillance-under-section-702-foreign-intelligence-surveillance\">Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/meet-executive-order-12333-the-reagan-rule-that-lets-the-nsa-spy-on-americans/2014/07/18/93d2ac22-0b93-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html?utm_term=.47130a3bde89\">Executive Order 12333</a>. The government uses Section 702 and the executive order to sweep up massive amounts of data on people outside and inside the US. By concealing how evidence is collected, the government prevents the US Congress and the public from understanding the consequences of this and other controversial laws. Section 702 is currently the subject of a major reform battle in Congress, adding urgency to the issue.</p>\n<p>Parallel construction “flies in the face of everything that our justice system stands for,” a Virginia-based defense attorney who has represented a client in a case raising concerns about possible parallel construction said in an interview with Human Rights Watch.</p>\n<p>In the US criminal justice system, judges typically bar the prosecution from introducing evidence the government obtained through illegal activities, a doctrine known as “fruit of the poisonous tree.” By dodging this rule, the concealment of investigative practices through parallel construction could also remove a crucial incentive for the authorities to obey the law.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nJustice cannot rest on secret evidence, and the shadows are where abuses flourish. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Sarah St.Vincent</h4>\n<p>US Program researcher</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\nWhen defense attorneys attempt to find out whether such concealment has occurred in a case, they face stiff opposition from prosecutors, Human Rights Watch found. An inability to compel prosecutors to reveal original sources of information can put fair-trial rights in jeopardy, as well as the human right to be notified of any government interferences with privacy.</p>\n<p>Congress should adopt laws requiring the government to disclose complete information to defendants about the origins of the investigations in their cases, Human Rights Watch said. Judges should also consider directing the government to disclose any previously unrevealed investigative methods when the circumstances of the case suggest that parallel construction may have occurred.</p>\n<p>“Justice cannot rest on secret evidence, and the shadows are where abuses flourish,” St.Vincent said. “Congress, the courts, the Justice Department, and the intelligence agencies should end parallel construction now.”</p>",

Again.</p>\n<p>This time around, Karma, who always wears the Morning Star symbol of West Papua independence on his shirt, was detained by a uniformed Indonesian Armed Forces officer after disembarking at Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.</p>\n<p>What ensued was a 90-minute arbitrary detention in which seven Air Force officers, including one bearing a semi-automatic rifle, interrogated Karma about the symbol on his shirt. The officers insisted Karma remove that symbol from his clothing and asked if he was a member of the armed separatist Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka or OPM). According to Karma, throughout the interrogation, the officers verbally abused him, calling him “scoundrel,” “monkey,” and “moron.” They subsequently transferred Karma to the custody of airport police who released him without charge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/23/dispatches-indonesia-frees-papuan-political-prisoner\">Karma, who spent 11 years behind bars after being convicted in 2005 of <em>makar</em></a> – rebellion or treason – for publicly raising the Morning Star flag, is no stranger to abuse at the hands of Indonesian authorities. In November 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.freedom-now.org/news/united-nations-finds-filep-karma%E2%80%99s-imprisonment-in-violation-of-international-law/\">United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared him a political prisoner</a> and demanded that the Indonesian government release him, “immediately and unconditionally.” The authorities only released him in November 2015.</p>\n<p>Karma is just one of many Indonesians targeted under articles 106 and 110 of the Indonesian Criminal Code, which imposes multi-decade prison terms on peaceful protesters advocating independence or other peaceful political change. Many such arrests and prosecutions are of activists who raise banned symbols, such as the Papuan Morning Star or the South Moluccan RMS flags. (Human Rights Watch takes no position on whether Papua should be independent, but we oppose the imprisonment of people who peacefully express support for self-determination.)</p>\n<p>Karma’s experience last week was an unwelcome reminder that his freedom remains at risk so long as rights-violating laws are on the books, and that there are Indonesian officials who would rather call him a “monkey” than respect his right to free expression.</p>",

While some Ghanaian officials have publicly called for an end to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity, the government has yet to repeal a colonial-era law that criminalizes same-sex activity.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The 72-page report, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/node/312882\">“<em>’No Choice but to Deny Who I Am’: Violence and Discrimination against LGBT People in Ghana</em>,”</a> shows how retention of section 104(1)(b) of the <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/gh/gh010en.pdf\">Criminal Offences Act, 1960</a> prohibiting and punishing “unnatural carnal knowledge,” and failure to actively address violence and discrimination, relegate LGBT Ghanaians to effective second-class citizenship. Police officials and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) have taken some steps to protect LGBT people.

Human Rights Watch also interviewed three representatives of human rights organizations based in Ghana, a CHRAJ complaints officer, the assistant police commissioner, and three diplomats in Accra.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">Many of those interviewed said that the law contributes to a climate in which violence and discrimination against LGBT people is common. The provision is rarely, if ever, used to prosecute people, and unlike several of its neighbors, Ghana has not taken steps in recent years to stiffen penalties against consensual same-sex conduct or to expressly criminalize sexual relations between women.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">“The government should recognize that we are human beings, with dignity, not treat us as outcasts in our own society,” said a 40-year old lesbian from Cape Coast. “We want to be free, so we can stand tall in public and not deal with obstacles and harassment daily – this will make it easier for us to get an education, learn a trade, get jobs and be useful and productive Ghanaians.”</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The Ghana Police Service has at times responded appropriately to abuses against LGBT people, for example in cases of false accusation and blackmail of gay men in Tamale. CHRAJ has an online system to register allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and has processed 36 cases.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">\n<div data-type=\"promo_box\">\n<div>\n<article data-eq-pts=\"large: 728\">\n<span></span>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/08/witness-ghanas-lesbians-lives-rejection-and-fear\">\n<img width=\"832\" alt=\"Witness: For Ghana’s Lesbians, Lives of Rejection and Fear\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16x9/public/multimedia_images_2018/201801lgbt_ghana_lesbians_1.jpg?itok=GwAN_gTa\" height=\"468\">\n</a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<h2> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/08/witness-ghanas-lesbians-lives-rejection-and-fear\">\nWitness: For Ghana’s Lesbians, Lives of Rejection and Fear </a>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Three young women can't ever return home because of their sexuality</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/08/witness-ghanas-lesbians-lives-rejection-and-fear\">Read their story</a> </div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">But in February 2017, Mike Ocquaye, the parliament speaker, referred to homosexuality as an “abomination” and called for stricter laws against same-sex conduct. In July, during a public discussion about prospects for abolishing the death penalty, he equated homosexuality with bestiality. His comments have heightened tensions for LGBT people and contributed to an increase in calls by some opinion leaders, including other members of parliament, to further criminalize same-sex activity.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">In a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51WBgwfKiJQ\">interview</a> with Al Jazeera, President Nana Akufo-Addo made rather conciliatory remarks. When asked why the law remained on the books, he said he did not believe “a sufficiently strong coalition has emerged which is having that impact on public opinion that will say change it – let’s then have new paradigm in Ghana.”</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">Dozens of LGBT people have been attacked by mobs or by members of their own families, Human Rights Watch found. In August 2015, in Nima, a town in the Accra region, members of Safety Empire, a vigilante group, brutally assaulted a young man they suspected was gay. In May 2016, in a village outside Kumasi in the Ashanti region, the mother of a young woman organized a mob to beat up her daughter and another woman because she suspected they were lesbians and in a same-sex relationship. The two young women were forced to flee the village.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312890\">\n<img alt=\"A young lesbian woman at an LGBT community center in Accra, Ghana.\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201801africa_ghana_lgbt_main.jpg?itok=PhRyBMmz 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201801africa_ghana_lgbt_main.jpg?itok=Mwa4oLI9 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201801africa_ghana_lgbt_main.jpg?itok=dn7R2N3Y 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/946w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201801africa_ghana_lgbt_main.jpg?itok=-xfP7Web 946w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201801africa_ghana_lgbt_main.jpg?itok=a_0hxdYu 1070w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2017/201801africa_ghana_lgbt_main.jpg?itok=ZKVC1eMi\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312890\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p> A young lesbian woman at an LGBT community center in Accra, Ghana.  </p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2017 Human Rights Watch</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">Lesbians, bisexual women and transgender men are frequently victims of family violence, Human Rights Watch found. Lesbians described being threatened, beaten, and driven from their homes after family members learned of their sexual orientation. One woman said that when her family heard that she was associating with LGBT people, they chased her out of the house with a machete. She has not been able to go back home to visit her 2-year old daughter. LGBT people’s fear that the law could be used against them, combined with social stigma, serves as a barrier to seeking justice, Human Rights Watch found.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The law is inconsistent with basic tenets of the Ghanaian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law, respect for human dignity and the right to privacy. The law also violates several human rights treaties that Ghana has ratified. In April 2014, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights adopted its groundbreaking <a href=\"http://www.achpr.org/sessions/55th/resolutions/275/\">resolution 275</a>, calling on African governments to prevent and punish all forms of violence targeting people on the basis of their real and imputed sexual orientation or gender identity.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The government of Ghana should repeal the specific provision in the Criminal Offences Act that criminalizes unnatural carnal knowledge and act swiftly to protect LGBT people from all forms of discrimination, intimidation and violence based on their real or imputed sexual orientation and gender identity.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">Ghanaian authorities should also engage in a constructive dialogue with the LGBT population to better understand its needs – with a particular focus on addressing the intersecting forms of discrimination that affect lesbian and bisexual women – and ensure that the necessary legislative and policy measures are taken to ensure their safety, dignity, and equality.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">“LGBT Ghanaians should have the same protection from the government as everyone else,” Isaack said. “And the government should work to address the stigma that subjects people to violence in their own homes, the place where they should feel safest.” </div>\n</div>",

On September 12, Saudi authorities confirmed a crackdown against those acting “for the benefit of foreign parties against the security of the kingdom and its interests.” Saudi authorities carried out another wave of arrests in early November against people they <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/08/saudi-arabia-corruption-arrests-raise-due-process-concerns\">accused of corruption</a> and held many, arbitrarily, at five-star hotels until they agreed to turn over assets to the state.</p>\n<p>“Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman’s efforts to reform the Saudi economy and society are bound to fail if his justice system scorns the rule of law by ordering arbitrary arrests and punishments,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson\">Sarah Leah Whitson</a>, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “There’s no justification for punishing family members of a detainee without showing even the slightest evidence or accusation of wrongdoing on their part.”</p>\n<p>A family member said that two men who identified themselves as State Security arrived at 6 p.m. on September 7, ignored requests to show a warrant, searched the house, and detained al-Awda.</p>\n<p>Saudi authorities have neither questioned nor charged al-Awda, the family member said, and have held him in solitary confinement. He said he believed that al-Awda was being held because he hadn’t complied with an order from Saudi authorities to tweet a specific text to support the Saudi-led isolation of Qatar. Instead, he posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/salman_alodah/status/906280562956132352\">tweet on September 9</a>, the second part of which stated, “may God harmonize between their hearts for the good of their people,” an apparent call for reconciliation between the Gulf countries.</p>\n<p>The family member said that authorities have permitted al-Awda only one 13-minute phone call, in October.</p>\n<p>Authorities <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-clerics.html?_r=0\">detained</a> al-Awda’s brother Khaled after he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/khalid_aloadah/status/907157189831389184\">tweeted</a> about his brother’s detention, media reported. He remains in detention. Al-Awda’s family member said Saudi authorities imposed travel bans on 17 members of his immediate family, one of whom discovered the ban when attempting to leave the country. He said the immigration officer told his family member that the royal court itself had imposed the travel bans for unspecified reasons.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has documented Saudi Arabia’s rampant use of arbitrary travel bans and detentions of Saudi citizens over the years. Authorities have often broken Saudi law in imposing travel bans, Human Rights Watch found. Aside from a court ruling, the authorities may impose bans “for defined reasons related to security and for a known period” and must notify those banned within one week of the ban. Human Rights Watch found that many Saudi citizens only learned of their ban at airports, land crossings, and passport departments months or years after they were imposed. In many cases the authorities do not inform those banned from travelling of the reasons.</p>\n<p>Al-Awda is among dozens of dissidents, writers, and clerics detained since mid-September. Activists have circulated lists of more than 60 people being held, though Saudi authorities have not released information about their cases.</p>\n<p>Other prominent detainees in the group include Essam al-Zamil, an economist, Mustafa al-Hasan, an academic, Abdullah Al-Malki, a writer, and dozens of other clerics including Awad al-Qarni, Ibrahim al-Nasser, and Ibrahim al-Fares. Authorities imprisoned human rights activists <a href=\"https://features.hrw.org/features/HRW_2016_reports/140_Characters/index.html#en/abdulaziz-al-shubaily\">Abdulaziz al-Shubaily</a> and <a href=\"https://features.hrw.org/features/HRW_2016_reports/140_Characters/index.html#en/issa-al-hamid\">Issa al-Hamid</a> around the same time, both had recently lost appeals of convictions for their human rights work following unfair trials.</p>\n<p>Saudi courts have convicted at least 25 prominent activists and dissidents since 2011. Many faced sentences as long as 10 or 15 years, largely under broad, catch-all charges designed to criminalize peaceful dissent. They include “breaking allegiance with the ruler,” “sowing discord,” “inciting public opinion,” “setting up an unlicensed organization,” and vague provisions from the 2007 cybercrime law.</p>\n<p>Since 2014, Saudi authorities have tried nearly all peaceful dissidents in the Specialized Criminal Court, Saudi Arabia’s terrorism tribunal.</p>\n<p>Authorities have prosecuted nearly all activists associated with the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), one of Saudi Arabia’s first civic organizations, which called for broad political reform in interpretations of Islamic law. A Saudi court formally dissolved and banned the group in March 2013. The members faced similar vague charges, including disparaging and insulting judicial authorities, inciting public opinion, insulting religious leaders, participating in setting up an unlicensed organization, and violating the cybercrime law.</p>\n<p>Saudi activists and dissidents currently serving long prison terms based solely on their peaceful activism include Waleed Abu al-Khair, Mohammed al-Qahtani, Abdullah al-Hamid, Fadhil al-Manasif, Abdulkareem al-Khodr, Fowzan al-Harbi, Raif Badawi, Saleh al-Ashwan, Abdulrahman al-Hamid, Zuhair Kutbi, Alaa Brinji, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/06/saudi-arabia-intensified-repression-writers-activists\">Nadhir al-Majed</a>. Activists Issa al-Nukheifi and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/11/saudi-arabia-2-rights-advocates-arrested\">Essam Koshak</a> are currently on trial. Mohammed al-Oteibi and Abdullah Attawi are currently on trial for <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/15/saudi-arabia-prosecution-forming-human-rights-group\">forming a human rights organization</a> in 2013.</p>\n<p>“If Mohammad bin Salman wants to show that a new era has begun in Saudi Arabia, a refreshing first step would be the release of activists and dissidents who have never been charged with a recognizable crime and should never have gone to jail in the first place,” Whitson said.</p>\n</div>",

President Donald Trump has yet to nominate directors for either the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Office of National Drug Control Policy.</p>\n<p>Sessions’ combined actions will fuel arrests and mass incarceration in states and at the federal level. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/every-25-seconds/human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states\">Every 25 seconds</a>, someone in the United States is arrested for merely possessing drugs.</p>\n<p>One in nine arrests at the state level is for drug possession – 1.25 million arrests every year – and they all <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/12/us-disastrous-toll-criminalizing-drug-use\">cycle</a> through the criminal justice system. Human Rights Watch has documented that this massive effort has had negligible impact on drug availability, and has even worsened the harms of drug trafficking and drug dependence. Even though African Americans and whites use drugs at the same rates, African Americans are disproportionately targeted, arrested, and incarcerated for drug offenses. Those <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/11/prisons-are-making-americas-drug-problem-worse\">incarcerated</a> for drug offenses typically do not have access to drug treatment and can carry a scarlet letter for years, which impedes successful reentry into society by limiting housing and employment options.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, the war on drugs is again underway. It’s now up to Congress to check the Justice Department’s misguided policies by passing legislation to decriminalize possession for personal use of marijuana and other drugs.</p>\n<p> </p>",

The accusations were widely reported by Chinese media, and later that day the university suspended him from teaching and launched an investigation.</p>\n<p>“I hope this act of <em>weiquan</em> [rights defense] will enable more people … to have enough courage to step forward and say #MeToo,” <a href=\"https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404191660669056150#_0\">wrote Luo on her social media account</a>.</p>\n<p>After the university’s swift action, <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PO_sZ51uIJ3HHZtAy4InFQ\">many Chinese asked</a>, “Is #MeToo finally coming to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/china-and-tibet\">China</a>?”</p>\n<p>But past events serve as a cautionary tale – at least on China’s university campuses. In the past four years, 13 incidents prompted universities to pledge to investigate allegations of sexual harassment by professors, <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMDc5MDUxNA==&mid=2651123552&idx=1&sn=0bd88437d83bef0ea957a7d4c8b8a0df&chksm=8113d5fdb6645cebb11ba380fa076dcc4ab2ae906b5435b58e63be9ff1aff83ac9f975fb2ca7&scene=21#wechat_redirect\">according to the NGOCN</a>, an online information platform for Chinese nongovernmental organizations. But not all those universities provided further information, and those that did only imposed light punishments, such as suspensions. In 2014, Xiamen University merely suspended history professor Wu Chunming from teaching after a group of female students accused him of coercing them into having sex with him. One year later, <a href=\"http://news.sohu.com/20151225/n432592495.shtml\">Wu was chosen to be a founding member of a prominent archaeologists’ group</a>.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.jiemian.com/article/1245048.html\">a 2017 survey of 6,592 college students and recent graduates by the Guangzhou Gender and Sexuality Education Center and the public interest law group Beijing Impact</a>, 69 percent reported that they had been sexually harassed, but less than 4 percent had reported it to their university or the police. The report says only 5 percent of universities offer sexual harassment prevention training, and no school has established formal procedures to handle sexual harassment complaints.</p>\n<p>In September 2014, <a href=\"https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140911/c11harassment/en-us/\">256 professors and students signed an open letter urging the Ministry of Education to establish sexual harassment prevention and response guidelines for university campuses</a>. In October 2014, the <a href=\"http://old.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s7002/201410/175746.html\">ministry issued a document prohibiting university teachers from “sexually harassing” students or, “having improper relationships,” with them</a>, but the document failed to elaborate on the meaning of these terms or spell out punishments.</p>\n<p>Chinese universities will come in line with the #MeToo movement when they promptly, thoroughly, and impartially investigate sexual harassment allegations, when they appropriately define and hold people accountable for sexual harassment, and when students have confidence to report what happened to them.</p>",

Will people be allowed to protest peacefully, without fear of arrest, intimidation, or politically motivated charges?</p>\n<p>Federal police investigators have long used Maekelawi to interrogate Ethiopia’s most prominent political prisoners. As <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/10/17/they-want-confession/torture-and-ill-treatment-ethiopias-maekelawi-police-station\">Human Rights Watch documented, torture and mistreatment are major problems there and across Ethiopia’s detention sites</a>. While Maekelawi’s announced closure is good news, it will mean nothing if prisoners are simply relocated to another facility to face the same abuses. The government should send a message to security officials countrywide that torture and other ill-treatment is prohibited and will be punished. And it can start by holding to account those responsible for torture at Maekelawi.</p>\n<p>Over the last two years, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/15/such-brutal-crackdown/killings-and-arrests-response-ethiopias-oromo-protests\">government security forces have arrested tens of thousands of people and killed over 1,000 protesters</a>. This crackdown has led to resolutions from the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/18/european-parliament-demands-investigation-ethiopia-killings\">European Parliament</a> and growing concern from the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/united-states\">United S</a><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/united-states\">tates</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/128\">Congress</a>. Whether today’s announcement is a genuine step toward reform or merely a move to stifle growing international criticism is unclear. Governments shouldn’t wait to find out, but press Ethiopia in the coming weeks to create a timeline for releasing all those held for their peaceful political views and dropping any charges against them.</p>\n<p>Ethiopia’s government should also adopt other human rights reforms, including permitting peaceful protests and reforming repressive laws. It should also stop restricting access to information by ceasing jamming of foreign radio and television transmissions and <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/traffic/overview?fraction_traffic=start:1503360000000;end:1514937599999;product:21;region:ET&lu=fraction_traffic\">unblocking the internet, which has been unavailable in many parts of Ethiopia since mid-December</a>. Such reforms would signal the ruling coalition’s willingness to listen to its citizens’ calls to end repression and embark on a path that offers greater respect for human rights.</p>",

Yezidi forces were also implicated in two other incidents of enforced disappearances of members of the Imteywit and Jahaysh tribes in late 2017.</p>\n<p>“As the ground fighting against ISIS winds down in Iraq, state security forces need to turn their focus to preventing retaliation and upholding the rule of law,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/lama-fakih\">Lama Fakih</a>, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Past atrocities against the Yezidis don’t give its armed forces a free pass to commit abuses against other groups, whatever their past.”</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch spoke to two Imteywit members who traveled through the village where, two hours later, the 52 people went missing. Human Rights Watch also spoke to a member of the PMF intelligence services who had visited the village and saw several mass graves that local Yezidi residents told him contained the bodies of the Imteywit victims. A Yezidi community leader provided to Human Rights Watch a list of five Yezidi fighters who he said told him they had killed the families.</p>\n<p>In late April, as fighting approached the area just south of the Sinjar region, ISIS forces moved their families from the village of Ain Ghazal in Qayrawan to the desert north of the town of Baaj, two Imteywit men said. They said that on June 4, the Imam Ali Battalions, a PMF unit, retook the area from ISIS, and started moving local families out of the desert in a convoy of 70 cars traveling north toward Tel Afar. The two men and their relatives – 22 men, 20 women, and 10 children from the Imteywit tribe traveling in seven cars – broke off from the other members of the convoy.</p>\n<p>When one car in the smaller convoy got a flat tire, the other cars stopped and waited for the tire to be fixed. The two men opted to head north ahead of the others, and traveled about 18 kilometers, reaching the village of Qabusiye at about 2 p.m. They said that a car with four Yezidi fighters, one of whom they recognized from home, flagged them down and forced them out of their car. The fighters asked them where they were from and said they would kill the two men as revenge for what ISIS had done to the Yezidis. Just then, the men said, a vehicle carrying Imam Ali Battalion fighters drove up, which ended the altercation, and escorted the two men to safety in the town of Qayrawan.</p>\n<p>The men said that two hours later they called a cousin traveling in the convoy to warn them about the Yezidi fighters on the road. The cousin said they were arriving at Qabusiye, but then the call dropped, and his phone was soon switched off. The men said their relatives never made it to Qayrawan and the men have not been able to find out any information about their relatives since. The men gave Human Rights Watch a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/list_names_52_missing_convoy.pdf\">list of the 52 people in the convoy</a>.</p>\n<p>In early 2017, Yezidi fighters formed the Lalish Brigades and the Ezidkhan Brigades, units under the PMF, a force of the Iraqi prime minister, and therefore part of the state’s armed forces. Two Yezidi community leaders told Human Rights Watch that the Ezidkhan Brigades were responsible for the abduction and killing of the 52 Imteywit tribe members. One said that fighters from the Ezidkhan Brigades told him the unit had detained the families in the convoy and held them for two days in the abandoned village, then killed them. He shared photos of women’s and men’s sandals, jewelry, a woman’s scarf, and tufts of hair that he said belonged to the families.</p>\n<p>A member of the PMF intelligence services told Human Rights Watch that he was sent to Sinjar to investigate the allegations. With help from local Yezidis he located a cluster of four mass graves in Qabusiye, which he visited on December 5. He said he saw the bones and skulls of at least four children, tufts of women’s hair, and women’s and children’s shoes and bracelets in the vicinity of the graves.</p>\n<p>In July, a legal adviser to the Ezidkhan Brigades told Human Rights Watch that Yezidi forces were involved in the capture of 52 people, but that members of the Imteywit tribe were “dogs who deserve to die.” Another senior Yezidi military commander said in early December that, “If any members of the Imteywit or Jahaysh tribes try to return to Sinjar, we will kill them.” Other senior Yezidis have alleged that the Imteywit and Jahaysh tribes participated with ISIS in the executions and abuse of Yezidi men and women in August 2014. Members of the two tribes denied these allegations and said that the Yezidis were scapegoating them for ISIS atrocities.</p>\n<p>Responsibility for investigating and prosecuting abuses against the Yezidis and other groups such as the Imteywit and Jahaysh rests with the Iraqi government, Human Rights Watch said. In July a spokesman from Iraq’s Foreign Affairs Ministry told Human Rights Watch that government representatives in Sinjar had investigated the Qabusiye incident and that their initial findings were that Yezidi forces had abducted the Imteywit civilians as revenge for abuses against Yezidi women. He said that the government intended to hold those responsible to account. Since then, however, Human Rights Watch has received no responses to queries as to whether anyone has been held accountable for the apparent killings.</p>\n<p>Members of the Imteywit and Jahaysh tribes have reported other incidents in which alleged Yezidi forces have forcibly disappeared and possibly killed their members. An Imteywit man told Human Rights Watch that on August 14, an Imteywit tribal commander and seven farmers went missing when they traveled to their former village to work their agricultural land. The forces in control of the area at the time were a mix of Shia and Yezidi PMF units. Two men from the Jahaysh tribe said that on February 26, when members of the tribe fled their villages as fighting approached, armed men wearing PMF badges disappeared 10 men who were escorting their livestock by foot from the area. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate this information or the units implicated.</p>\n<p>Enforced disappearances occur when a person is arrested or detained by government officials or their agents and the authority refuses to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty, or to reveal the person’s fate or whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Iraqi criminal justice authorities should investigate alleged criminal offenses by all parties to the conflict in a prompt, transparent, and effective manner, up to the highest levels of responsibility. Those found criminally responsible should be appropriately prosecuted. Summary executions and torture during an armed conflict are war crimes.</p>\n<p>No armed forces in Iraq should be detaining suspected criminals for prolonged periods, but should instead hand suspects immediately over to judicial authorities to investigate.</p>\n<p>International law requires that punishment for crimes only be imposed on the people responsible, after a fair trial to determine individual guilt. Imposing collective punishments on families, villages, or communities violates the laws of war and is a war crime.</p>\n<p>“Allowing the many armed forces involved in Iraq’s civil war to retaliate against any group they think was complicit with ISIS would shatter the rule of law,” Fakih said. “Baghdad needs to assert its authority over the criminal justice process and end armed group vigilantes.”</p>\n</div>",

A new law that expands the jurisdiction of the military justice system to these situations is hampering the investigation, and federal military prosecutors are not doing enough to investigate the case.</p>\n<p>Homicide investigators have followed their usual procedures to interview civil police personnel involved in the raid. But state prosecutors need to interview all those who participated in the joint army and Civil Police raid. The army has not made its personnel available to talk to the Group of Specialized Action in Public Security (<strong>GAESP</strong>, in Portuguese) – prosecutors responsible for investigating unlawful killings and other abuses by state police – as witnesses, or even provided them with a list of the personnel who participated in the operations in the Complexo do Salgueiro neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“More than a month later, Brazilian authorities have made no serious effort to investigate these killings,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/maria-laura-canineu\">Maria Laura Canineu</a>, Brazil director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities need to take immediate steps to show that they are not intent on burying this case.”</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2015-2018/2017/lei/L13491.htm\">law</a> approved in October 2017 gives the military justice system jurisdiction over cases involving members of the armed forces who kill civilians during policing operations, as may have occurred in this case. This change makes independent investigations of such crimes virtually impossible, and threatens to put accountability for extrajudicial killings out of reach. The law needs to be repealed immediately, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>Even under the new law, federal military prosecutors can and should do more to investigate crimes.</p>\n<p>Federal military prosecutors do have the authority to compel members of the armed forces to give statements, and can file charges against them in military courts. However, the federal military prosecutor in charge of the case told Human Rights Watch she was relying on the army to collect the statements from those who participated in the operation, instead of taking those statements herself. She said she trusted the army procedures.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nThis case shows how the law that expands military jurisdiction for homicide of civilians is a recipe for impunity. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Maria Laura Canineu</h4>\n<p>Brazil Director, Americas Division</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>On November 7, about <a href=\"http://www.jb.com.br/rio/noticias/2017/11/07/mais-de-3500-militares-atuam-na-operacao-policial-em-sao-goncalo/\">3,500 members of the armed forces, as well as federal, civil, and military police forces</a> carried out a large-scale operation in the Complexo do Salgueiro and Anaia neighborhoods of São Gonçalo, near the city of Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n<p>As part of that operation, the army used helicopters to transport personnel to a forested area within the neighborhood, the Eastern Military Command <a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/antes-de-mortes-no-salgueiro-cupula-da-seguranca-colocou-militares-na-mata-22173278\">said</a>. Forces in Complexo do Salgueiro were to force suspects to flee through the Estrada das Palmeiras road and the forested area, where the hidden personnel expected to intercept them, a justice official told Human Rights Watch. The <a href=\"https://extra.globo.com/casos-de-policia/dias-antes-de-mortes-no-salgueiro-reuniao-na-cupula-da-seguranca-decidiu-botar-militares-na-mata-22170866.html\">operation failed</a>, apparently because someone tipped off local gang members.</p>\n<p>Three days later, CORE – the Civil Police elite unit – and the army conducted a new similar operation in the same area, but with fewer personnel, to prevent leaks, the justice official said. Security personnel entered the neighborhood in three armored vehicles, including both army and Civil Police personnel, federal military prosecutors told Human Rights Watch.</p>\n<p>When the armored vehicles reached the Estrada das Palmeiras road in the early hours of November 11, they found people shot and injured, CORE personnel said. They did not call emergency services, a prosecutor told Human Rights Watch. Many hours later, the families of at least two injured men found them and took them to the hospital. One, Luiz Octávio Rosa dos Santos, died of his wounds on December 1. The other seven died at the site.</p>\n<p>Two people who were injured <a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/antes-de-mortes-no-salgueiro-cupula-da-seguranca-colocou-militares-na-mata-22173278\">told</a> prosecutors and reporters that the shots came from the forested area, and that the people who shot them had emerged from the trees. A survivor <a href=\"https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/11/21/politica/1511289685_933810.html\">said</a> they wore black and had laser-vision rifles and helmets. A justice official told Human Rights Watch that such equipment is typical of military special forces and that the CORE does not possess it.</p>\n<p>Residents told Defezap – an independent phone service to which people can report police abuse – that at about 11 p.m. on November 10, they saw men rappelling from helicopters into the forest without lights, a representative of Defezap told Human Rights Watch. That is the only way to enter the area, other than through a mangrove swamp.</p>\n<p>On November 11, the Eastern Military Command <a href=\"https://extra.globo.com/casos-de-policia/diretor-da-core-disse-dh-que-acao-com-sete-mortos-era-missao-de-reconhecimento-do-exercito-22066291.html\">said</a> in a public statement that those who participated in the operation encountered “armed resistance by criminals.” Later, the command amended that story, saying only that Army personnel “heard shootings.”</p>\n<p>The command <a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/exercito-diz-que-envolvidos-em-acao-no-salgueiro-so-serao-apresentados-justica-militar-1-22068724\">said</a> no army personnel fired their weapons, and that therefore, the army would not open an investigation into the killings. The federal military prosecutor opened her inquiry anyway, but was relying on the army to investigate.</p>\n<p>Before the October law was enacted, the federal police investigated unlawful killings of civilians by members of the armed forces during policing operations, and federal prosecutors would bring those cases to trial before civilian courts. Under the new law, investigations of those cases are carried out by the armed forces themselves, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/pt/news/2017/10/12/310100\">federal military prosecutors – who are civilians – are the only ones who can file charges</a>.</p>\n<p>Trials are held before a military court made up of four military officers and one civilian judge – each with an equal vote. The appeals court, the Superior Military Tribunal, consists of 15 military officers and five civilians. Its decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Federal Court, a civilian court.</p>\n<p>Under international and regional norms, cases involving alleged extrajudicial executions and other grave human rights violations should not be tried before military courts. The Inter-American Court on Human Rights has ruled that <a href=\"http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_163_ing.pdf\">“military criminal jurisdiction is not the competent jurisdiction to investigate</a> and, if applicable, prosecute and punish those responsible for human rights violations.”</p>\n<p>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights <a href=\"http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/cases/1996/ecuador10-95.htm\">has held</a> that it is not appropriate to try violations of human rights in military jurisdictions, given that “when the State permits investigations to be conducted by the entities with possible involvement, independence and impartiality are clearly compromised.”</p>\n<p>While the investigations stall, the families of those killed suffer in silence. “My world has collapsed,” Márcia Silva Vaz, the mother of Marcelo Silva Vaz, one of the victims, told Human Rights Watch. “My son was wonderful.”</p>\n<p>Marcelo, 32, a father of four, was shot dead while riding on a motorcycle with his best friend, Bruno Coelho da Agonia, 26, who was also killed. They both had steady jobs and lived outside of the Complexo do Salgueiro neighborhood. They went there to attend a popular outdoor dance, which was taking place about 3 kilometers away from the place where they were shot dead.</p>\n<p>“This case shows how the law that expands military jurisdiction for homicide of civilians is a recipe for impunity,” Canineu said. “With the armed forces increasingly involved in law enforcement operations in Rio de Janeiro, it’s critically important for the law to be repealed immediately.”</p>",

State Security prosecutors <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/arabic/middleeast-38432794\">ordered him detained</a> on <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.net/news/humanrights/2016/12/25/%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86-15-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A\">charges</a> of “incitement against state institutions and broadcasting false news with the aim of spreading chaos.”</p>\n<p>“Mahmoud Hussein languishing for over a year in pretrial detention demonstrates Egypt’s deep-rooted intolerance for free expression as well as the unlawful use of pretrial detention as a punishment,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson\">Sarah Leah Whitson</a>, Middle East Director at Human Rights Watch. “Everyone is entitled to due process, and no one should be imprisoned for being a journalist.”</p>\n<p>National Security Agency (NSA) officers interrogated Hussein for more than 15 hours upon his arrival at Cairo International Airport on December 20, 2016, and then released him but kept his passport, Gomaa told Human Rights Watch. Two days later, December 22, 2016, NSA officers called him and told him to retrieve his passport that morning. His phone was shut off at 11 a.m. He was not heard from again until 10 p.m., when he showed up at his family’s home in handcuffs accompanied by NSA agents, who then proceeded to destroy private belongings in the home and arrest his two brothers. His brothers were released 11 days later.</p>\n<p>Hussein is being held in Tora Prison in Cairo. Egypt’s judiciary has regularly renewed Hussein’s pretrial detention since his arrest, most recently on <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/egypt-al-jazeera-journalist-jailed-45-days-171214151355336.html\">December 14</a> for 45 more days. His family is allowed weekly visits, Gomaa told Human Rights Watch.</p>\n<p>Hussein’s colleagues at Aljazeera said he returned to Egypt to visit his family and not for work. He had worked for Al Jazeera Mubasher Masr, the Egyptian affiliate of Doha-based Al Jazeera, whose Cairo bureau was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/08/egypt-halt-arbitrary-action-against-brotherhood-media\">raided and closed down in July 2013</a> after the military led the forcible overthrow of then-president Mohamed Morsy. Al Jazeera then suspended broadcasting on its Egyptian affiliate station in December 2014 until it could obtain the “<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30585551\">the necessary permits</a>.”</p>\n<p>Its operations remain suspended and <a href=\"http://pr.aljazeera.com/post/105871768275/changes-for-al-jazeera-mubasher-channels\">Al Jazeera Mubasher</a>, a separate Arabic affiliate, now transmits on its frequencies. Hussein was working with Al Jazeera Mubasher at the time of his arrest. In 2017, Al Jazeera <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/14/media-blocked-threatened-dispute-qatar\">has faced closures</a> of its English channels’ bureaus in several countries after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar.</p>\n<p>Egyptian authorities have arrested other Al Jazeera journalists. They include the former Al Jazeera English Cairo bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, and Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed, all of whom, while released, had faced multi-year sentences <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/23/egypt-jazeera-convictions-miscarriage-justice\">without any credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing</a>.</p>\n<p>Since President Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi came to office in 2014, Egypt has quickly become one of the worst jailers of journalists, ranking among the top three countries in the world with the most journalists in jail in 2017, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). More than half of the 20 journalists who remain in jails in Egypt are in poor health, the organization <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2017/12/journalists-prison-jail-record-number-turkey-china-egypt.php\">said</a>. The government maintains highly restrictive policies toward government critics and has recently put in place media-monitoring bodies that <a href=\"http://www.youm7.com/story/2017/4/11/3-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF/3185805\">effectively censor</a> all forms of print and television outlets. Over 425 websites, most dedicated to news and politics, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/15/egypt-intensifying-repression-basic-freedoms\">are banned</a> in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Under Egyptian law, prosecutors have broad powers – in violation of international law – to hold those suspected of committing major offenses, including political and national security crimes, in pretrial detention for up to five months without regular judicial review. Judges can extend the detention for up to two years without proper hearings or any substantive justification from prosecutors. Hundreds of prisoners who spent months in pretrial detention, without due process, were later released or acquitted.</p>\n<p>“Egypt’s track record for jailing journalists and keeping detainees in pretrial detention grows more deplorable every year. Regardless of whether they intend to move ahead with charges, authorities should release Hussein from pretrial detention,” Whitson said.<br>\n </p>",

In October 2017, the government restricted the use of the al-Wafideen crossing, the only entry point for commercial merchandise, depleting scarce food and medical supplies and causing prices to skyrocket.</p>\n<p>From November 14 to November 30, the Russian-Syrian joint military operation conducted more than 400 airstrikes on Eastern Ghouta, according to the Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer group that works in anti-government areas, and <a href=\"http://www.syriahr.com/2017/12/05/%d8%ba%d9%88%d8%b7%d8%a9-%d8%af%d9%85%d8%b4%d9%82-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b4%d8%b1%d9%82%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b4%d9%87%d8%af-%d9%87%d8%af%d9%88%d8%a1%d8%a7%d9%8b-%d8%ad%d8%b0%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%8b-%d8%b9%d9%82/\">the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights</a>. The Russian-Syrian alliance struck more than half the towns in the besieged enclave at least once during this period, according to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GhoutaGMC/\">local</a> media monitors. Homes, a makeshift school, and a public market were among the civilian structures hit.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch documented three aerial attacks in Eastern Ghouta since November 14 that were apparently indiscriminate, in violation of the laws of war. One incident involved the use of cluster munitions, widely banned weapons that are inherently indiscriminate. These three attacks caused the death of at least 23 civilians and wounded many others.</p>\n<p>The threat to civilians from the intensified aerial campaign has been exacerbated by lack of access to medical care and essential foodstuffs, Human Rights Watch said. The air and ground attacks and siege have together resulted in the deaths of at least 190 civilians, including 51 children, between November 14 and 30, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.</p>\n<p>Anas al-Ta’an, a local resident, told Human Rights Watch: “We don’t know whether to hide in the basement from the strikes, or risk it to stand in line for two hours in the hopes of getting bread for our children. This is the choice we make, and the situation is beyond tragic.”</p>\n<p>The laws of war do not prohibit sieges so long as the harm to the civilian population does not exceed the expected military gain, starvation is not used as a method of warfare, and humanitarian aid delivery is not hindered.</p>\n<p>Syrian forces have severely restricted the entry of essential food and medicines and the exit of civilians from Eastern Ghouta in violation of the laws of war, Human Rights Watch said. Entry of humanitarian aid through UN convoys has been extremely limited, with the Syrian government only granting permission to the UN to enter a handful of times over the past year. While a besieging force may prevent the entry of weapons and food and other supplies destined for opposing armies, essential goods for civilians must be allowed.</p>\n<p>A UN official told Human Rights Watch, “the government systematically rejects life-saving medicines and medical equipment.” The UN <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-74\">estimate</a>s that aid reached only a quarter of the besieged population in Eastern Ghouta in 2017.</p>\n<p>The government has also unnecessarily hindered the evacuation of people with urgent medical needs, Human Rights Watch said. <a name=\"_Hlk501621788\">The </a><a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/joint-press-stakeout-un-special-envoy-syria-staffan-de-mistura-and-un-1\">UN said</a> that close to 500 people require immediate medical evacuation and that at least 10 people have died since June while awaiting Syrian government permission to leave Eastern Ghouta for treatment elsewhere. UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, reported in December that 137 children, ages 7 months to 17 years, needed immediate medical evacuation.</p>\n<p>The escalating airstrikes and tightening of the siege in November meant hospitals were over capacity, lacking necessary medical supplies, and doctors were overwhelmed. “There was a child, Osama Al-Tukhi, he was 5 years old and he died of a brain infection,” a representative of a medical facility in Eastern Ghouta told Human Rights Watch “We could have saved him. He only needed an antiviral shot that is easily attainable in any Damascus pharmacy, but not here.”</p>\n<p>Infighting among anti-government armed factions and restrictions on freedom of movement within the enclave have contributed to worsening humanitarian conditions, Human Rights Watch said. Anti-government armed groups should allow unimpeded humanitarian access and movement of civilians away from areas of hostilities, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>In December, local media <a href=\"https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2017/12/table-agreement-get-tahrir-al-sham-ghouta/\">reported</a> that negotiations were ongoing between the Russian and Syrian governments and non-state armed groups operating in Eastern Ghouta for the evacuation of the armed group Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham, previously Jabhat al-Nusra, from the besieged enclave. Any agreement should be consistent with laws-of-war protections for both civilians who evacuate and those who remain behind, and should ensure delivery of humanitarian aid to populations in need, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>“Russia will have a difficult time bringing Syrians together in Sochi if it is indiscriminately bombing civilians while allowing its ally, the Syrian government, to continue its increasingly deadly siege of Eastern Ghouta,” Fakih said. “At the very least, it should pressure the Syrian government to allow humanitarian aid and evacuate urgent medical cases.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Besieged Enclave</strong><br>\nThe besieged enclave of Eastern Ghouta, east of Damascus, is covered by a July de-escalation <a href=\"http://tass.com/world/957354\">agreement</a> between Russia, the Syrian government, and Syrian anti-government groups, that calls for a ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Syrian state media reported that Syrian government military operations against the enclave were in response to an <a href=\"http://aldorars.com/en/news/2692\">attack</a> on November 14 by the anti-government armed groups <a href=\"https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-restarts-operation-expel-ahrar-al-sham-east-damascus-suburb/\">Faylaq al-Rahman and Ahrar al-Sham</a> on a strategic objective, the Vehicles Administration Center, near the town of Harasta. The Russian government <a href=\"http://tass.com/politics/977790\">stated</a> that the alliance attacks in Eastern Ghouta since November 14 have been targeting Islamic State (also known as ISIS) forces.</p>\n<p>Seven people in Eastern Ghouta told Human Rights Watch that Russian-Syrian alliance airstrikes were not limited to Harasta, where clashes were occurring, or areas where fighters were based, but extended to densely populated areas with no evident military objectives. In the three November airstrikes that Human Rights Watch documented, witness accounts and a review of video and photographs of the strikes gave no indication of any military objective in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>Non-state armed groups in Eastern Ghouta have also shelled neighboring government-held areas using mortars, causing civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, <a href=\"http://www.sana.sy/?p=671835\">according</a> to pro-government media sources. Attacks using indiscriminate weapons in populated areas violate the laws of war.</p>\n<p>Ahmed Hamdan, a local working in media in Eastern Ghouta, said: “There is no way for us, regular people, to identify why we were hit or where we will be hit next. There is no place that we can say, ‘Oh, if I stay away from this area, I will be safe.’ Nowhere is safe.”</p>\n<p><strong>Three Unlawful Airstrikes</strong><br>\nHuman Rights Watch documented three apparently unlawful airstrikes in Hamouriyeh and Irbin in Eastern Ghouta in November and early December. While Human Rights Watch has not been able to determine whether the attacks were carried out by Russian or Syrian aircraft, only Russian and Syrian forces have been conducting airstrikes in the area. But responsibility for an unlawful airstrike does not rest solely with the aircraft or weapon used. All those taking part in the attack, including at the command level, may bear legal responsibility. The laws of war require all government forces involved in an apparently unlawful attack to carry out a credible and impartial investigation of the episode.</p>\n<p><strong>Hamouriyeh</strong><br>\nFour local residents said that Russian-Syrian alliance aircraft have struck the town of Hamouriyeh, seven kilometers from Damascus, several times since November 14. Hamouriyeh is a densely populated, primarily residential town located near the center of the besieged enclave. It is under the control of the anti-government armed group Faylaq al-Rahman.</p>\n<p>On November 19, between 5:30 and 6 p.m., Russian or Syrian aircraft struck Hamouriyeh with cluster munitions three times, according to three residents and online reports. The residents saw the aircraft as it circled above the town. One said that the strikes occurred on Hamouriyeh Square and near Hayjat Street, both residential areas. Available information indicates that the three strikes were with inherently indiscriminate cluster munitions.</p>\n<p>A civilian photographer who accompanied a Syria Civil Defense ambulance to the site of the second attack, said that when the driver, Alaa al-Din Juha, stepped out of the car, he set off an unexploded submunition, killing him. Two videos appear to show the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXV9V8UgZhM\">explosion of the submunition</a> and Juha’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGTzleJQ4Y\">body</a> next to the Syria Civil Defense ambulance.</p>\n<p>Another civilian, Abdo Yassin, died the next day from injuries sustained in the attack, the witnesses said.</p>\n<p>The three residents said they were unaware of any military forces in the area struck, which was far from the front lines. Hamouriyeh is three kilometers from the nearest front line.</p>\n<p>On December 3, two airstrikes hit between noon and 1 p.m., according to four residents who heard the plane before the strikes. The first strike hit the road in a residential area between Hamouriyeh and Irbin, near a medical facility called the Balsam Center. Ahmad Hamdan, a local media activist who photographed the damage, said that a rocket lodged deep in the concrete of the road and exploded:</p>\n<p>I saw six who were dead immediately. The rocket fell in the middle of the road, it created a big hole. The diameter was about 1.4 meters. It went into the concrete and the explosion was huge. There were no remnants; the explosion was significant. There was a steel [iron] door to one of the residential buildings, which was heavily dented.</p>\n<p>The second airstrike, approximately half an hour later, contained three munitions, according to three residents. Nibras Hamuriyeh, who lives across the street from where the munitions struck, said that he saw three munitions hit his neighborhood from a plane while he was on the street heading home. He ran home, which was right across the street from one of the strikes, to find the doors and windows broken, and his wife and children crying – “but thankfully unharmed.”</p>\n<p>Two other munitions struck the roofs of buildings, Hamuriyeh said. He said that the strike killed his uncle and two adult male cousins who lived in one of the buildings. The building also housed a makeshift school in the basement, which was being used because the regular neighborhood schools had been closed after earlier attacks, two residents said. The makeshift school was destroyed, but no students were harmed because school was out for the day. Hamuriyeh said several other residents also died in their homes from the strikes.</p>\n<p>Residents who documented deaths from the December 3 strikes provided a list of 18 civilians killed, including six children.</p>\n<p>Video footage from first responders arriving on the scene shows extensive damage to the neighborhood from the December 3 airstrikes.</p>\n<p><strong>Irbin</strong><br>\nOn November 23, at approximately 12:30 p.m., a Russian or Syrian aircraft carried out about eight strikes on the Eastern Ghouta town of Irbin, three residents said. Irbin is located near the edge of the enclave, less than a kilometer from the Vehicles Administration Center that anti-government armed groups attacked on November 14. The town is controlled by Faylaq Al-Rahman.</p>\n<p>Four of the strikes hit a neighborhood in Irbin with a public market and residential buildings, approximately 100 meters apart, two residents said.</p>\n<p>Ammar al-Bouchiri, a local resident who was at home when the first strike hit, said:</p>\n<p>We heard a warplane… The munition hit the house that is immediately next door, that of our neighbors. The explosion was massive. I was at home and the sound was very loud. And I was thrown to the side.</p>\n<p>He said he couldn’t feel anything for several seconds:</p>\n<p>There was yelling, there was so much noise, and dust was all over the place. I couldn’t see anymore because of that. I couldn’t find my way out. The ceiling was down, doors were broken, and I couldn’t get out. I couldn’t see; the situation was horrifying.</p>\n<p>The strikes killed three civilians: a shop-owner, and two children, and injured at least 20, according to media reports and witnesses.</p>\n<p>“When I first got out, there was a dead man on the road facing our house, he was hit with a shrapnel piece,” al-Bouchiri said. “There were also two kids, one of them was still alive, we could still hear her voice.”</p>\n<p><strong>Restrictions on Essential Goods and Humanitarian Access </strong><br>\nSyrian government forces and associated militias have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2013. In April 2017, government forces retook the Barzeh and Qaboun neighborhoods of eastern Damascus, closing off smuggling tunnels between the neighborhoods and further restricting the movement of aid into and evacuation of people with urgent medical needs out of the enclave.</p>\n<p>The government further tightened the siege on October 3 by severely restricting the use of al-Wafideen, the only commercial trade-crossing with the enclave. The closure of the tunnels and the crossing made prices of goods in Eastern Ghouta skyrocket.</p>\n<p>An aid worker said that in November the one-month cost in Eastern Ghouta of a “survival minimum expenditure basket” (SMEB) – a unit used by humanitarian organizations to measure basic survival needs per household – was approximately US$700. A UN inter-agency <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-duma-inter-agency-assessment-food-security-update-november-21-2017\">assessment</a> found that by mid-November, the price of a bundle of bread in Eastern Ghouta was 85 times the price in nearby Damascus; in August it was 24 times the Damascus price. Residents estimated that the average worker made only between US$50 and a US$100 a month and said that the majority were unemployed.</p>\n<p>Firas Abdullah, a media activist in the Eastern Ghouta city of Douma, described impact of the siege:</p>\n<p>The siege is killing us. A man must work two jobs to scrape together enough money to put one meal for his children a day, if that. It’s almost as bad as it was in 2013-14. Then, we got to a point where we used to take the feed that we saved for the chicken – very harsh, inedible stuff – and eat it.</p>\n<p>The government allows only one well-known merchant to use the al-Wafideen crossing to bring merchandise in, residents and aid workers said. They said that in November the merchant was required to pay a tax of approximately 2000 Syrian pounds (US$4) for each kilogram of material brought in, making goods even more expensive.</p>\n<p>“Imagine the path to let aid in is clear, they [the Syrian government] can do it,” the doctor from Irbin said. “They just don’t want to. Instead, we must pay exorbitant prices, that go to the regime to fund the very militias that are besieging us.”</p>\n<p>Another doctor said: “A lot of children are dying from malnutrition. And this is a shame to the entire international community, to all those who are watching.”</p>\n<p>The Syrian government has restricted the number of UN aid convoys to the area and the amount and types of goods that can be delivered. Humanitarian workers said that the convoys that entered since September did not contain aid that was sufficient for the population they were intended for and often did not meet their needs. Even when permission is granted, administrative and security issues often result in excessive delays, a UN official based in Damascus said.</p>\n<p>Since the tightening of the siege, there have been many reports of harm to civilians from a lack of adequate food or medicine. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said that at least five civilians died as a direct result of lack of food or medicine between November 14 and 28. On November 2, local media <a href=\"http://video.qasioun-news.com/en/video/show/14459\">reported</a> that a one year-old girl named Maram, who had been born with one kidney, needed medicine that was unavailable and surgery that could not be performed within the enclave.</p>\n<p>Siege Watch <a href=\"https://siegewatch.org/#13/33.5460/36.3866\">reported</a> that on November 13, a child named Walid with a heart condition had died after Syrian authorities had refused requests for a medical evacuation. A hospital director said on November 30 that medications were running low, and that patients needed procedures and treatments that were unavailable: “a little girl died from a cardiac issue, to diagnose her we needed an echocardiogram, which we didn’t have for children.”</p>\n<p>The doctors said that the lack of medicine and adequate medical care has made people desperate. On December 15, the Damascus and Rural Damascus Directorate of Health, which is responsible for medical services in Ghouta, sent a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/syria_eastern_ghouta_doctors.pdf\">letter</a> to the World Health Organization describing the strain that the systematic denial of medicine and medical supplies has placed on the overwhelmed medical system of Eastern Ghouta.</p>\n<p>The doctor from Irbin described trying to evacuate a girl, Sara, who had a malignant tumor in her eye, a genetic condition that had killed two of her siblings:</p>\n<p>We left no stone unturned trying to get her out, to treat her but to no avail. No one would let her out, or help us. She died. Her parents gave birth to another girl, around a month or two ago, initial tests indicate that she has the same sickness. Her father, this time, when I wanted to discuss treatment with him refused outright. He said he doesn't want to discuss treatment anymore, he doesn't want to treat her anymore – there is no point. We’ll wait to die together, he told me.</p>\n<p>The doctor described the pressures on the medical system:</p>\n<p>On the 18 or 19 [of November], there was an airstrike and a relative of mine was injured. A young guy, 33 years old with children, whose hands had to be amputated. I was the one to treat him, but I didn't realize it was my relative. I didn’t realize until I got home, and my wife told me a relative of mine had to have his hand amputated. I asked her, was it the one with the two hands amputated? She said yes. I treated him but I was so overwhelmed with the number of patients, I didn’t even recognize him. This is our lives now.</p>\n<p><strong>International Humanitarian Law</strong><br>\nInternational humanitarian law, or the laws of war, which apply to the armed conflict in Syria, prohibit attacks that target civilians or civilian property, that do not or cannot discriminate between civilians and combatants, or that cause harm to civilians or civilian property that is disproportionate to any anticipated military gain. All parties to the conflict have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians from harm, and not to deploy forces in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>The laws of war do not prohibit siege warfare so long as the purpose is to achieve a military objective and not to starve or cause disproportionate harm to the civilian population. Civilians may not be forcibly displaced unless their security depends on their evacuation.</p>\n<p>A party that imposes a siege that has the effect of starving the civilian population has an obligation to provide access for humanitarian aid for civilians in need and not arbitrarily interfere with it. Parties must also ensure the <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule56\" target=\"_blank\">freedom of movement</a> of humanitarian workers, which can only be restricted temporarily for reasons of imperative military necessity.</p>\n<p>Individuals who commit serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent – that is, intentionally or recklessly – may be prosecuted for war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime.</p>",

He was condemned to death by means of Alabama’s electric chair, dubbed “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/11/usa.matthewengel\">Yellow Mama</a>,” which the state ceased using in 2002. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-long-defense-of-the-alabama-death-row-prisoner-doyle-lee-hamm\">Appeals by his counsel</a> have stopped Hamm from being executed for decades.</p>\n<p>In late September, a medical expert evaluated Hamm’s capacity for execution by lethal injection. The <a href=\"http://www.columbiadoctors.org/mark-j-heath-md\">doctor who examined Hamm</a> found only one “potentially accessible” vein on Hamm’s right hand. Use of that vein “would have a high chance of rupturing the vein and being unsuccessful,” and failure of corrections staff to properly administer the drugs could “cause Mr. Hamm to become paralyzed and consciously suffocate,” which would be “an agonizing death.”</p>\n<p>Alabama is one of 31 US states that impose the death penalty on people. So far in 2017, <a href=\"http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/views-executions?exec_name_1=&exec_year%5B%5D=2017&sex=All&sex_1=All&federal=All&foreigner=All&juvenile=All&volunteer=All\">23 people in eight states</a> have been executed, all by lethal injection. Several US states use controversial, experimental drug combinations and refuse to disclose their composition. <a href=\"http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions\">Data from the death penalty center</a> shows that seven percent of lethal injections in the US between 1990 and 2010 were botched.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch opposes capital punishment in all circumstances and has long called for the US to abolish the death penalty. In 2006, Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/report/2006/04/23/so-long-they-die/lethal-injections-united-states\">concluded that state negligence in the administration of lethal injections</a> can cause agonizing, painful deaths. The death penalty is an attack on <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/10/10/us-attack-human-dignity\">human dignity</a>, and is unique in its cruel finality.</p>\n<p>Alabama should not execute Hamm, who may suffer an “agonizing, bloody, and painful death.” The cruelty of such a death speaks for itself.</p>",

On December 15, former Ethiopian government official Eshetu Alemu was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-warcrimes-ethiopia/ethiopian-ex-official-gets-dutch-life-sentence-for-war-crimes-idUSKBN1E91UO\">convicted</a> of war crimes and sentenced to life in prison by a Dutch court for his role in ordering the executions of 75 people, including children under 18, in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Over <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/Ethiopia919.pdf\">150,000 students, academics, and political opponents were killed</a> during the Derg’s “Red Terror” campaign. Countless others were disappeared, arrested, or tortured. Senior Derg officials, including Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam, were convicted of genocide in absentia in 2006 after a 12-year trial in Ethiopia’s courts. They were sentenced to life in prison. Eshetu, the Derg’s senior representative in Gojam province at the time of his crimes, had been <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07ADDISABABA170_a.html\">sentenced to death</a> in absentia by an earlier Ethiopian court. In 1991 when the Tigrayan Peoples’ Liberation Front (TPLF) overthrew the dictatorship, Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe where he was afforded protection by then-president Robert Mugabe. Eshetu fled to the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>Eshetu’s conviction should send a powerful message that officials can and will be held to account for atrocities, and that the passage of time is no guarantee of impunity. This message is especially important in Ethiopia, where the TPLF, who has been in power since the Derg’s overthrow, has also committed serious abuses with impunity. These include its military’s murder, rape, and torture of Anuak civilians <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/03/23/ethiopia-crimes-against-humanity-gambella-region\">in Gambella in 2003</a> and 2004, and war crimes and crimes against humanity <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/ethiopia0608_1.pdf\"> in the Somali Region  in 2007</a>.  Additionally, a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/15/such-brutal-crackdown/killings-and-arrests-response-ethiopias-oromo-protests\">brutal crackdown</a> by government security forces against protesters beginning in 2015 left over a thousand dead. The government has not permitted independent investigations into any of these events and Ethiopia has strongly resisted <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/18/ethiopias-bloody-crackdown-case-international-justice\">calls for an international investigation</a>. Justice and accountability for Ethiopia’s many victims in the last 50 years, has been all too rare.</p>\n<p>For families of Ethiopia’s  many victims of torture, killings, and other serious abuses, Eshetu’s conviction should give them hope that those responsible will one day be held to account. </p>",

With this decision, Burma joins a handful of pariah governments – notably Eritrea, Syria, Burundi, and North Korea – that have outright refused to engage with UN experts assigned to their countries.</p>\n<p>This refusal to cooperate is just Burma’s latest move in its efforts to conceal the military’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/rohingya-crisis\">crimes against humanity</a>, including killings, rape, and mass arson, against the ethnic Rohingya population in Rakhine State, which have forced over 645,000 Rohingya to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/11/burma-rohingya-return-deal-bad-refugees\">flee to Bangladesh</a> since late August. It echoes the government’s refusal to grant access to the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/02/qa-united-nations-fact-finding-mission-myanmar\">UN Fact-Finding Mission</a>, established in March to investigate allegations of rights abuses in Rakhine State and elsewhere in the country.</p>\n<div data-type=\"quote\">\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nIn early December, Burma promised cooperation with UN experts....

Despite the transfer of almost 3,000 people since early December, the hotspots on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros, and Kos still have almost 11,000 people in facilities with a total capacity of just 5,576. More than 1,000 people have arrived to the Greek islands during the same period.\n<div>\n<article data-eq-pts=\"large: 728\">\n<span></span>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/12/21/trapped\">\n<img width=\"832\" alt=\"TRAPPED\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16x9/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712greece_moria_zahra.jpg?itok=QAcvv7T9\" height=\"468\">\n</a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<h2> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/12/21/trapped\">\nTRAPPED </a>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Asylum Seekers in Greece</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/12/21/trapped\">Special Feature</a> </div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n\n<p>“While Prime Minister Tsipras’s decision to move 5,000 asylum seekers from the islands to the mainland is beneficial for those moved, it is still a half measure that leaves thousands others out in the cold,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/eva-cosse\">Eva Cossé</a>, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch. “It’s an important start but more is needed, including support from other EU governments, to make sure that no one has to spend the winter in a freezing tent.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/12/21/trapped\">Poignant testimonies</a> from the ground provide a gripping look into the dire situation and distress of asylum seekers who are trapped on the Greek islands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/opentheislands\">In a campaign that began on December 1</a>, 13 human rights and aid organizations called on Tsipras to end Greece’s policy of containing asylum seekers on the islands. The groups said that Greek authorities should immediately transfer people to improved conditions on the mainland and take concrete measures before the official start of winter so that no asylum seekers are left out in the cold. The groups also said that other EU leaders should take a clear stand to end the containment policy that keeps asylum seekers trapped on the islands under an agreement with Turkey to send people refused asylum back there.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch and other groups participating in the campaign will continue campaigning throughout the winter, highlighting the deplorable conditions asylum seekers trapped on the islands face. The groups will press the Greek government and EU leaders for a more effective response that protects the rights and reduces the suffering of asylum seekers arriving in Greece.\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312124\">\n<img alt=\"Ali, a 22-year-old Afghan asylum seeker with a disability, living in Moria camp, on the beach in Lesbos, Greece.

The High-Level Inquiry Commission was established in 2016 to investigate alleged excessive and indiscriminate use of force during violent protests that left at least 45 people dead, including nine police officers.</p>\n<p>While the commission officially handed its report to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, the government has not indicated next steps based on the report’s findings and its recommendations. The victims of the violence and their families have a right to know what happened.</p>\n<p>“The Nepali government overcame political bickering to appoint an independent commission to investigate the Terai violence,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/brad-adams\">Brad Adams</a>, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Prime Minister Deuba should publish the report, announce a plan to provide answers and redress for victims, and work with the incoming government to put that plan into effect.”\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nThe Nepali government overcame political bickering to appoint an independent commission to investigate the Terai violence. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Brad Adams </h4>\n<p>Asia Director </p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>The 2015 violence flared over sharp disagreements over a new constitution that many indigenous and minority groups in Nepal’s southern belt, known as the Terai, felt did not answer their longstanding calls for equal rights, provincial delineations, and devolution of power.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch and other organizations found credible evidence of serious human rights violations by the government security forces after they were deployed to contain the protests. Human Rights Watch documented eyewitness accounts of police abuses in all five districts it visited, including unlawful killings, including of children; beatings of protesters and people in their homes; and use of threats and racial insults against minority group members. The violence led to a virtual blockade of Nepal’s southern border with India, which created serious shortages of basic goods in a landlocked country that relies on its southern border for trade.</p>\n<p>The commission, after submitting its report, expressed frustration at the lack of government support throughout the process, including not having access to basic funds to buy pens and paper. The commission also said that it received very little government cooperation during its field visits, despite its status as a national commission of inquiry with the mandate to direct cooperation from local agencies. The commission in its statement also signaled the need for security sector reform.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch expressed concern that the commission report would languish and no action would be taken on its recommendations. The formation of a new government after provincial and national elections increases the likelihood that the report would fall by the wayside.</p>\n<p>“We have seen many valuable commission reports gather dust in Nepal, and watched as victim after victim suffered without justice or compensation,” Adams said. “As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, Nepal needs to take this opportunity to show its commitment to addressing the human rights of all its citizens.”</p>",

Instead, his wife and 3-year-old daughter, both Kyrgyzstan citizens, will have to travel to neighboring <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/kazakhstan\">Kazakhstan</a> if they want to welcome in the new year together.</p>\n<p>On December 9, authorities denied Rickleton, a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> citizen, entry to Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/03/kyrgyzstan-rights-group-representative-banned\">The same thing happened to me, just over two years ago</a>.</p>\n<p>In my case, instead of the usual quick passage through passport control at Manas International Airport – neither <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/united-states\">US</a> nor UK nationals need a visa to enter Kyrgyzstan – I was pulled aside and told I couldn’t enter. Nothing was provided to me in writing about the decision. I was then put on a plane departing Bishkek, without a chance to pack up my apartment or say goodbye to friends, as my home was in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n<p>People don’t expect Kyrgyzstan to arbitrarily deport international journalists or ban foreign rights workers. It’s the only Central Asian country that has come close to holding free and fair elections, and where people can generally gather to peacefully express critical opinions. The Parliamentary Assembly for the Council of Europe granted Kyrgyzstan “Partnership for Democracy” status, and the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union\">European Union</a> and Kyrgyzstan have begun negotiations to enhance their relations.</p>\n<p>But Kyrgyzstan’s human rights situation has suffered multiple setbacks this year. On December 19, a national television station, NTS, had its property frozen by a court order. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/12/kyrgyzstan-president-targets-critics\">Local journalists and a rights defender critical of the government have been targeted with unfounded lawsuits</a> and barred from leaving Kyrgyzstan until they pay multi-million sums (roughly US$430,000) in “damages.” <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/24/kyrgyzstan-travesty-justice-rights-defender\">A local rights defender is serving a life sentence</a> in the face of a UN Human Rights Committee decision calling for his immediate release. This July, Vitaly Ponomarev, a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia\">Russian</a> rights defender who has long worked on Central Asia, was denied entry at the border and banned from the country. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/30/kyrgyzstan-supreme-court-upholds-rulings-muzzle-free-speech\">The country’s supreme court has upheld rulings muzzling free speech</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not too late for Kyrgyzstan’s government to reverse this trend. Instead of targeting critical media, Kyrgyzstan’s recently elected president and his government <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/20/hrw-letter-president-kyrgyzstan-sooronbai-jeenbekov\">should ensure space for independent journalism and civil society organizations</a><a>.</a>The authorities should also welcome Chris Rickleton and others back to Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n<p>The European Union, EU member states, and the United States, among others, should speak out against Kyrgyzstan’s assault on freedom of expression and the harm caused to the Kyrgyz people.</p>\n<p>With these blows to free speech, keeping silent is no longer an option.</p>",

This is not news to my friend Soraya (a pseudonym), a lawyer working in Kabul trying to improve access to justice for women.</p>\n<p>Several months ago, she and I observed a rape trial. As is often the case in Afghanistan, the session took place in the cramped judge’s chambers, with witnesses for the prosecution and defence, and both families present. It was a crowded, tense scene; everyone was anxiously awaiting the final evidence and the verdict.</p>\n<p>Everyone except the judge. As he waited for the paperwork, he tossed questions at Soraya. Apparently trying to impress her, he boasted of becoming a judge after cheating on his bar exam. He beckoned her over, and handed her his phone. Soraya told me that he asked her for her phone number and pressured her to friend him on Facebook.</p>\n<p>In conservative <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/afghan-metoo-women-harassment.html\">Afghanistan, where social media, particularly Facebook, have become an arena for sexual harassment</a>, and women and girls sometimes face criticism or abuse simply for using social media, such a request is particularly offensive. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/afghan-metoo-women-harassment.html\">Women have described receiving rape threats via Facebook</a>. In one rape case Soraya and I investigated, the perpetrator had stolen a young woman’s phone and threatened to make public her identity and photos on Facebook unless she had sex with him.</p>\n<p>Harassment was made a crime in Afghanistan in 2009, but the term was not defined. In 2016, the <a href=\"http://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/senate-approves-anti-harassment-women-and-childrens-act\">parliament passed a bill defining harassment</a> as, “physical contact, illegitimate request, verbal and non-verbal harassment, and any other acts that caused psychological, physical damage, and humiliated a woman or a child.”</p>\n<p>These definitions are broad, providing ample ammunition to government officials seeking to curb harassment. Less evident is any genuine will to change the culture of institutions to instil respect for women. Until that happens, new laws and regulations will do little to protect women from a daily hail of abuse.</p>",

Yet despite their many differences, authorities on both sides have one thing in common – a fondness for attacking the media. In its <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/ranking?\">2017 World Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked Iraq 158 out of 180 countries</a> – and the past three days have made it clear why.</p>\n<p>On December 17, the governor of Iraq’s Anbar province, Muhammad Rakkan <a href=\"http://aliraqnews.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%BA%D9%84%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD/\">al-Halbusi, reportedly ordered the independent TV satellite channel Al-Sharqiya to close its local offices</a>. According to media reports, he cited <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharqiyatv/posts/1636703549753091\">a problem with the channel’s licensing as the reason for the closure – something the outlet denies</a> having any problem with. <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2017/12/iraqs-al-anbar-governor-orders-tv-station-to-close.php\">The Committee to Protect Journalists said the governor's order came hours after the station published a report</a> alleging the <a href=\"https://www.alsharqiya.com/news/?p=75528824\">governor and other politicians were planning to rig Iraq’s parliamentary elections slated for May 2018</a>.</p>\n<p>And on the evening of December 19 in Iraq’s Kurdistan Region, following protests against unpaid government salaries in parts of the region, Kurdish Asayish security forces forced independent media outlet NRT to take its three TV channels off the air. Asayish also forced NRT to evacuate their offices, and confiscated some of the outlet’s recording equipment. NRT’s head, Awat Ali, told Human Rights Watch that the forces said the <a href=\"http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/191220171\">Kurdish culture ministry had issued a decree to stop NRT’s broadcasting for a week</a>. The decision cited <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/nrt_order_sorani_and_english.pdf\">coverage of the protests and alleged incitement to violence as the reason for the closure</a>. Ali said they were simply reporting developments on the ground. Today, NRT’s websites were also taken offline.</p>\n<p>Ali said that on the same day security forces at Sulaymaniyah airport arrested NRT’s founder, Shaswar Abdulwahid, who gave up the outlet a month ago, as he returned from a trip abroad. Abdulwahid’s family have received no news of him since. A <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/shaswar_wahid_order.pdf\">court order calling for legal action against him indicates that he was detained for encouraging people to join the protests and attack government offices</a>.</p>\n<p>These latest examples highlight the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/02/iraq-investigate-killing-school-principal-cameraman\">peril</a> facing <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/25/iraqi-kurdistan-kurdish-journalist-abducted-killed\">journalists who report on Iraq</a> in ways <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/02/iraq-al-jazeera-closure-blow-free-speech\">authorities dislike</a>.

They should commit to making space for the media – even when they do not like the coverage.</p>",

The last time the party joined a coalition, Austria’s government was shunned by its European partners and threatened with <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union\">EU</a> sanctions. This time the reaction has been muted, perhaps because radical right populism in European politics is increasingly accepted as the norm.</p>\n<p>What will the FPÖ’s impact on law and policy be? It is already clear that the <a href=\"https://www.oevp.at/download/Regierungsprogramm.pdf\">coalition’s five-year government program</a> will likely pose serious challenges for the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/17/radical-right-populist-success-elections-endangers-human-rights-europe\">human rights values at Europe’s heart</a>.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s new Chancellor and leader of the centre right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), the senior partner in the coalition, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebastiankurz/status/942783470228647936\">travelled to Brussels yesterday to meet with EU leadership</a>. The choice of destination for his first trip is supposed to symbolize the new Austrian government’s commitment to the EU.</p>\n<p>But the EU needs clear leadership that respects rights in asylum, migration, integration, and security policy. It is far from clear whether Austria, which will assume the rotating presidency of the European Council in mid-2018, will contribute in that way.</p>\n<p>On migration, Austria’s new government proposes that, instead of being admitted to Europe, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/02/italy-navy-support-libya-may-endanger-migrants\">migrants and refugees rescued at sea</a> should be sent to processing centers outside Europe. In other words, they will not be brought first to a place of safety, as the law of the sea requires. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/03/open-letter-austrian-foreign-minister-sebastian-kurz-libya\">Kurz has previously pushed an agenda</a> to replicate <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/australia\">Australia</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/12/29/managing-migration-australia-no-model-europe\">odious refugee-processing model</a> – by outsourcing responsibility for asylum seekers to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/libya\">Libya</a>. Clearly, Austria’s mainstream ÖVP is part of the problem; this isn’t just about the FPÖ’s influence.</p>\n<p>Under what the new government terms, “the fight against political Islam,” it proposes measures to close kindergartens, schools, and cultural institutions associated with types of Islam the government considers alien to Austrian values. It also proposes <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/austrian-government-far-right-strache-kurz-immigration-eu-a8116371.html\">“sanctions” against immigrants who fail to integrate with Austrian culture</a>.</p>\n<p>This anti-immigrant sentiment is closer to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/04/relocation-farce-brings-shame-europe\">the positions taken by the “Visegrád Group</a>” – a bloc made up of the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/czech-republic\">Czech Republic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/hungary\">Hungary</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/poland\">Poland</a>, and Slovakia – than the founding values of the European Union.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/942348008338882561\">Europe’s leaders and institutions should be vigilant about the potential threat to the Union posed by new Austrian government policies</a>. Europe should stand up for rights of minorities and migrants, including through legal enforcement action if necessary. After all, it’s the values of equality, dignity, and respect that are the glue holding the Union together.</p>",

The authorities subsequently charged <a href=\"http://7amleh.org/2017/11/16/cybercrime-laws-as-a-weapon-against-expression/\">several journalists</a> as well as a human rights defender, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/09/palestinian-human-rights-activist-charged-under-repressive-new-cybercrimes-law/\">Issa Amro</a>, under the law.

Palestine assumed these legal obligations when it ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, among other treaties, in 2014.</p>\n<p>“The Palestinian authorities should amend the recent cybercrime law to ensure protection rather than violation of Palestinian digital rights and freedom of expression,” said Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh. “Palestinians have long been struggling for freedom and justice and it is critical that freedoms within the virtual sphere are upheld and respected.”</p>\n<p>“The law, as it stands now, still violates international treaties the Palestinian government pledged to uphold and breaks a promise authorities made to respect the basic rights of its people,”,” said Fadi Quran, senior campaigner for Palestine at Avaaz. “At this point the Palestinian government should either include all civil society amendments or axe the law.”<br>\n </p>",

August 2012. </p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2012 Private</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n(Nairobi) – <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/africa/sudan\">Sudanese</a> authorities should immediately charge or release the human rights activist Rudwan Dawod and other activists in national security custody, and investigate allegations of ill-treatment and torture, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>Security officials detained Dawod, a 35-year-old dual Sudanese-American citizen, on December 6, 2017, in the El Jereif neighborhood in Khartoum. A witness told Human Rights Watch that plainclothes security agents arrested Dawod after he visited the area to show solidarity with local community <a href=\"https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/civil-disobedience-against-land-expropriation-in-khartoum\">protests against government land expropriations</a>. He is being held in an unknown location, without access to a lawyer or his family.</p>\n<p>“Sudan locks up activists for weeks on end, holds them incommunicado, and subjects them to abuse, including torture,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/jehanne-henry\">Jehanne Henry</a>, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Authorities need to end these detentions and grant all detainees full access to family, lawyers, and medical care.”</p>\n<p>Sudan’s National Security and Intelligence Service (NISS) officials are holding an unknown number of other activists, according to local rights groups. Known detainees include <a href=\"https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/two-darfuri-students-detained-other-still-held-incommunicado-in-khartoum\">Nasreldin Mukhtar</a>, a prominent Darfuri student activist who was arrested on August 22, and eight Darfuri students arrested in mid-September while protesting NISS detentions of two other students. NISS is well-known for abusing and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/sudan\">torturing detainees</a> in their custody. Mukhtar’s sister said in a video statement that she saw visible physical injuries on him when she visited him in October.</p>\n<p>“His face was full of bruises and injuries and he was trembling and very sick because of the detention and extensive beatings,” she said. “His situation was very bad.”</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has documented dozens of similar cases in recent years. During a crackdown on “civil disobedience” in November 2016, a NISS official beat a member of the Sudanese Congress Party (SCP), who was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/14/sudans-new-image-cant-disguise-harsh-reality\">detained for 50 days</a>, so badly that he required surgery. In December 2016, a British journalist and his Sudanese-American translator who entered Darfur to investigate allegations of chemical weapons <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/12/welcome-delay-us-sudan-sanctions\">were tortured, including beatings, use of electric shocks, and mock executions</a>. Dawod was among the scores of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/11/sudan-torture-abuse-demonstrators\">activists arrested during popular protests</a> in July 2012 and beaten and tortured in detention.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, the United States lifted decades-long economic sanctions on Sudan, following a January <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/sudan.aspx\">executive order</a> citing improvements in a number of key areas that did not explicitly include human rights reforms. Human Rights Watch has urged the US to put human rights <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/03/human-rights-benchmarks-sudan\">benchmarks</a> at the heart of its engagement with Sudan. Chief among them should be ending the practice of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture.</p>\n<p>“Torture and prolonged, arbitrary detention are still routine practice in Sudan, used as a means to stifle dissent and dialogue,” Henry said. “These tactics are further evidence of Sudan’s appalling rights record.”</p>",

After <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/after-almost-a-week-myanmar-authorities-silent-on-whereabouts-of-detained-reuters-journalists-idUSKBN1ED0DC\">more than a week</a>, the authorities have refused the journalists access to counsel and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/stephenadler-statement/statement-from-stephen-j-adler-president-and-editor-in-chief-reuters-idUSKBN1E723E\">provided no information on their whereabouts</a>, raising concerns of an enforced disappearance.</p>\n<p>On the evening of December 12, 2017, police detained Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, who were reporting on security force abuses against ethnic Rohingya for the Reuters news agency. On December 18, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/myanmar-government-says-case-against-reuters-journalists-can-proceed-idUSKBN1EC0O4\">the media reported</a> that President Htin Kyaw, a close ally of the de facto Burmese leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, approved charges against the journalists under the 1923 Official Secrets Act. </p>\n<p>“Burmese authorities should immediately release the two Reuters journalists whose detentions appear aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/brad-adams\">Brad Adams</a>, Asia director. “Their secret, incommunicado detention lays bare government efforts to silence media reporting on critical issues.”\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nBurmese authorities should immediately release the two Reuters journalists whose detentions appear aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Brad Adams </h4>\n<p>Asia Director </p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>Reuters reported that the two journalists were dropped off by their driver at a police compound for a meeting with police officers in Rangoon on December 12 but never returned. The next day the government confirmed that the two journalists had been detained along with two police officers, Capt. Moe Yan Naing and Sgt. Khin Maung Lin.</p>\n<p>Under Burmese law, no one may be detained for more than 24 hours without the approval of a judge. With judicial approval, a suspect may be detained without charge for up to 30 days if the criminal penalty for the alleged offense is greater than seven years in prison. It is not known whether the two journalists have appeared before a judge. An officer from Yangon Police Division told Reuters on December 14 that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/myanmar-journalists-group-to-don-black-t-shirts-over-arrest-of-reuters-reporters-idUSKBN1EA09Z?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29\">the police would not disclose the location</a> of the reporters until their investigation was completed.</p>\n<p>International human rights law provides that those arrested shall be informed of the reasons for their arrest and promptly brought before a judge and informed of any charges against them.</p>\n<p>The government’s failure to provide information on the whereabouts of the detained journalists or allow them access to counsel raises concerns of enforced disappearance. Enforced disappearances are defined under international law as the arrest or detention of a person by state officials or their agents followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty, or to reveal the person’s fate or whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Enforced disappearances violate a range of fundamental human rights protected under international law, including prohibitions against arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. “Disappeared” people are often at high risk of torture, particularly when they are detained outside of formal detention facilities such as prisons and police stations.</p>\n<p>“Burmese authorities should immediately reveal where they’ve taken the Reuters journalists, and until they are released ensure that they are allowed visits by counsel and family members,” Adams said.</p>\n<p>The government has indicated it will charge the two journalists under the 1923 Official Secrets Act. Section 3 of the act <a href=\"file:/C:/Users/vangs/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/I3J1Y8PP/Official%20Secrets%20Act%20(India%20Act%20XIX,%201923),%20www.incl.org/research/library/files/My\">punishes</a> receiving or disseminating a broad and vaguely defined range of documents, notably government documents, “which [are] calculated to be or might be or [are] intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy.” The statute does not require that the conduct result in any actual harm to national security or even that it create a significant risk of such harm. Nor does it exempt or consider as a defense or as a mitigating element, whether publication of the document was a matter of public interest, such as government wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Instead, the act requires only that the individual is acting “for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interest of the State” and that the document is potentially “useful” to another country. Being “useful” to another country is not the same as constituting a threat to national security, much less constituting a threat to national security that would outweigh other public interests.</p>\n<p>The imposition of criminal penalties for the receipt of information, without any requirement that the disclosure poses a real risk of harm, or any provision for protecting disclosures in the public interest, violates international standards for the protection of freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>The arrest of the Reuters journalists is just the latest incident of journalists being prosecuted in Burma for reporting critical of the government or the military. During Burma’s successive military governments, the media was tightly controlled. Although media freedoms expanded greatly in the years before the 2015 elections that brought the current government to power, the authorities frequently invoked abusive laws to prosecute journalists who ran afoul of the government.</p>\n<p>The current government has increasingly used these overly broad and vague laws against journalists who have reported critically on the government or military. In <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/u-n-chief-presses-for-release-of-arrested-reuters-journalists-in-myanmar-idUSKBN1E8183\">calling for the</a> release of the two journalists on December 14, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that their arrests were “clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country.”</p>\n<p>On June 26, the Burmese military <a href=\"http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/three-reporters-among-seven-arrested-in-myanmar-for-connections-to-ethnic-militia-06262017154723.html\" target=\"_blank\">detained</a> Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing from the <em>Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB),</em> and Thein Zaw, also known as Lawi Weng, from <em>The Irrawaddy,</em> after stopping their car as they returned from a drug-burning ceremony sponsored by an ethnic armed group. On June 28, the reporters were charged under section 17(1) of Burma’s 1908 Unlawful Associations Act. They were released and the charges <a href=\"https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/court-drops-charges-three-journalists.html\">were dropped</a> on September 15.</p>\n<p>Journalists have also been targeted under section 66(d) of the 2013 Telecommunications Act, which allows for prosecutions for defamation using online media, such as Facebook. According to a local research group, as of November, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ResearchTeamForTelecommunicationsLaw66D/posts/170170340242581\">nearly two dozen of the more than 90 cases filed</a> under this law since the change of government in 2016, had been filed against journalists.</p>\n<p>The chief editor of <em>The Voice Daily</em>, Kyaw Min Swe, and a satirical columnist, Kyaw Zwa Naing, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/timeline-journalists-attack.html/amp\">were arrested in June</a> when a Burmese soldier filed a case against them under the Telecommunications Act and the News Media Law for allegedly defaming the military. The military <a href=\"http://www.moi.gov.mm/moi:eng/?q=news/3/09/2017/id-11417\">later dropped</a> the case against both journalists.</p>\n<p>“The Burmese government’s increasing restrictions on the media should not be taken lightly and concerned governments should encourage the government to stop targeting journalists,” Adams said. “If the government continues to ratchet-up the pressure on the independent press, media freedom in Aung San Suu Kyi’s Burma will look a lot more like the media repression during the military junta.”</p>",

Yet Human Rights Watch previously <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/06/iraq-civilian-casualties-mount-west-mosul\">documented</a> that the strike killed 13 civilians.</p>\n<p>I wondered what the “available information” reviewed had been.

But since when is ISIS the standard against which coalition countries measure their actions?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the coalition is not doing all it can to investigate harm to civilians in its military operations against ISIS – investigations that are easier to make now that ISIS has been pushed out of Mosul.</p>\n<p>Last month, an in-depth <em>New York Times</em> investigation concluded that one in five coalition strikes resulted in civilian deaths – a rate more than 31 times that acknowledged by the coalition. The reporters found the US-led coalition consistently failed to properly investigate claims or to keep records that would make it possible to investigate claims. Last week, Marc Garlasco, a United Nations military analyst and war crimes investigator and former Human Rights Watch employee, took a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/49133/fix-militarys-broken-targeting-system/\">deeper look</a> at the issue. He blames this on the fact that “The tiny U.S. investigation team rarely speaks to people on the ground,” while also noting that the US no longer prioritizes, properly staffs, or properly investigates civilian casualties.</p>\n<p>The coalition’s methodology for investigating civilian airstrike casualties does not match what was done in previous <a href=\"https://civiliansinconflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ISAF_Civilian_Harm_Tracking.pdf\">operations</a>. It is not enough to say, “we’re better than ISIS” or “better than Russia.” Policymakers from coalition countries should take the civilian death toll seriously, as they have in the past, and provide the resources and commitment to ensure investigations are meaningful and that civilians harmed in unlawful strikes are promptly and appropriately compensated. </p>",

Saifuddin also set strict limits on his tolerance for LGBT people. He called for “religious adherents” to “<a href=\"http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2017/12/18/22184301/menteri-agama-imbau-kelompok-lgbt-dirangkul-dan-tak-dijauhi\">embrace and nurture</a>” LGBT people by reacquainting them with religious teaching, while in the same breath <a href=\"http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2017/12/18/22184301/menteri-agama-imbau-kelompok-lgbt-dirangkul-dan-tak-dijauhi\">asserting that, “there is no religion that tolerates LGBT action.”</a></p>\n<p>This is not Saifuddin’s first foray into doublespeak. In February 2016, as <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2016/08/10/2016-indonesias-lgbt-crisis-words\">Indonesian government officials embarked on a feeding frenzy of anti-LGBT rhetoric</a>, he said: “We cannot be hostile [toward] nor hate [LGBT people] as they are also citizens of the state. This doesn't mean that we condone or allow for the LGBT movement to shift the religious values and the identity of the nation.” That same month <a href=\"http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/02/17/055745802/Minister-Lukman-Speaks-about-LGBT\" target=\"_blank\">he urged nonviolence toward LGBT people</a> while suggesting they were “<a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/04/don-t-expel-lgbt-people-society-minister.html\" target=\"_blank\">mentally ill</a>” and in need of, “treatment – either psychological or religious.”</p>\n<p>That March he reiterated his conditional and contradictory approach to tolerance by calling for Indonesians, “to embrace [LGBT people] so they will be conscious that they live in a religious society which can't accept homosexuality.” And although <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/30/indonesian-lgbt-activists-receive-free-expression-award\">Saifuddin attended an awards ceremony in August 2016 for the Alliance of Independent Journalists</a>, which bestowed a prestigious freedom of expression award on two LGBT rights defenders, a week later he took pains to <a href=\"https://news.detik.com/berita/3286417/ini-penjelasan-menag-soal-orasi-kebudayaan-di-aji\">explain that he had no prior knowledge of the award winners’ identities</a>.</p>\n<p>Such dissembling makes many LGBT Indonesians – including religious leaders like <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/11/piety-shinta-ratri\">Shinta Ratri, who runs an Islamic boarding school for transgender women</a> – skeptical of Saifuddin’s embrace. Saifuddin’s flip-flops on tolerance for LGBT people are likewise no surprise to the country’s imperiled religious minorities. Saifuddin’s ministry is pushing a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/20/indonesia-religious-rights-bill-would-harm-minorities\">“Religious Rights Protection” draft law</a> that in fact enshrines both Indonesia’s abusive blasphemy law along with decrees that restrict religious minorities from constructing houses of worship.</p>\n<p>Saifuddin should publicly recognize and defend the rights of LGBT Indonesians, not subject them to cowardly and contradictory platitudes on “tolerance.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>(Washington, DC) – The December 6, 2017, indictment by Judge Claudio Bonadio of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, her Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman, and 10 others, for “treason” and “concealment” points to no evidence that would seem to substantiate those charges, Human Rights Watch said today. Bonadio accused the defendants of conspiring with Iran to undermine the criminal investigation of the 1994 terrorist attack on the <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/americas/argentina\">Argentine</a> Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA), in Buenos Aires,which killed 85 people and injured 300 others.</p>\n<p>\tThe charges refer to a 2013 “memorandum of understanding” signed by the Kirchner administration and the government of Iran to create an international commission of jurists with powers to review evidence against Iranians accused by Argentine judiciary of responsibility for the bombing, and to interrogate some suspects. The indictment says that the agreement sought to ensure impunity by lifting Interpol’s red notices – a form of international arrest warrant – against the suspects. The ruling orders the pretrial detention of six people, including now-Senator Fernández de Kirchner, and Timerman, who was sent to house arrest due to health problems. The judge asked Congress to strip Fernández de Kirchner of her parliamentary immunity.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312712\">\n<img alt=\"A man walks by a sign that reads &quot;Memory and Justice&quot; next to the names of the victims of the 1994 Argentine Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) bombing\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712americas_argentina_amia.jpg?itok=aZIZbSiB 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712americas_argentina_amia.jpg?itok=1VoxTLu7 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712americas_argentina_amia.jpg?itok=DrarBnlD 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712americas_argentina_amia.jpg?itok=UWIxuqE5 725w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712americas_argentina_amia.jpg?itok=iUw0w31z\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312712\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p>A man walks by a sign that reads &quot;Memory and Justice&quot; next to the names of the victims of the 1994 Argentine Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) bombing, placed outside the AMIA Jewish community center during commemorations of the 23rd anniversary of the attack in Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 18, 2017.</p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2017 Marcos Brindicci/Reuters</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>\t“Relatives of victims of the AMIA terrorist attack deserve justice for this heinous crime,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/jose-miguel-vivanco\">José Miguel Vivanco</a>, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “But, instead of promoting accountability, this far-fetched indictment further tarnishes the credibility of the Argentine judiciary over the AMIA attack investigations.”</p>\n<p>\tTwenty-three years after the AMIA bombing, no one has been convicted of the crime. In 2006 an Argentine federal court issued an international arrest warrant for key Iranian officials as well as a Hezbollah security chief. None have been arrested.</p>\n<p>\tThe new indictment fails to explain any clear need for pretrial detention. Under international human rights standards, pretrial detention should be used only <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/tokyorules.pdf\">as a means of last resort</a>, often because other means are insufficient to guarantee a person’s appearance at trial, protect public safety, or safeguard the integrity of an ongoing investigation. The seriousness of an alleged offense is not in and of itself a legitimate reason for pretrial detention.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nEven if the agreement with Iran provided little guarantee of justice for the AMIA victims, pursuing criminal charges for treason against officials responsible for negotiating an international accord seems strained and unreasonable. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>José Miguel Vivanco</h4>\n<p>Americas director</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>\tThe judge ruled that the defendants have “relations” with several unspecified “subjects” and this “could imply the existence of links to hamper the investigation or even evade justice.” In the absence of adequate, individualized grounds to incarcerate the defendants pending trial, courts should immediately reverse the decision, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>On December 11, Timerman asked Bonadio to revoke the house arrest order due to his serious health problems. Timerman receives almost daily treatment for cancer, which the house arrest would hinder, his lawyers said in a judicial brief Human Rights Watch reviewed. The next day, Bonadio rejected Timerman’s request and indicated that he should instead ask the court for permission to attend his doctors’ appointments.</p>\n<p>\tThe grounds for prosecution included in the indictment also seem dubious, Human Rights Watch said. The judge provided scant evidence that the agreement could have triggered lifting the Interpol red notices. Ronald Noble, Interpol’s secretary general between 2000-2014, has repeatedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RKNGlobal/status/939589926500360192\">said</a> that it could not. Bonadio has yet to call Noble to testify.</p>\n<p>\tOn December 11, 2017, the Argentine TV channel Todo Noticias reported that in November the current Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a letter to his Argentine counterpart Jorge Faurie that after signing the agreement the Iranian and Argentine governments had “asked the Interpol to end its obligations regarding the AMIA case.” Timerman and Noble <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RKNGlobal/status/939523732871229445\">denied</a> it.</p>\n<p>\tParts of the ruling point to the secrecy of the negotiation with Iran, the alleged “lack of university education” of Timerman, and unsubstantiated assertions that Iranian officials wrote the agreement. Some inferences in the indictment are simply bizarre and weak to the point of being ridiculous, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>\t“Even if the agreement with Iran provided little guarantee of justice for the AMIA victims, pursuing criminal charges for treason against officials responsible for negotiating an international accord seems strained and unreasonable,” Vivanco said.</p>\n<p>\tThe 2013 memorandum of understanding with Iran included vague language that could likely have made the oral statements by suspects in Iran inadmissible as evidence before Argentine courts – a critical factor to ensure accountability. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/18/argentina-press-ahead-94-bombing-probe\">criticized</a> the agreement in 2013. The agreement never took force entirely because, in May 2015, a federal court ruled it unconstitutional, and the current administration of President Mauricio Macri did not appeal.</p>\n<p>\tThe 2006 arrest warrant in the case was for the former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and seven Iranian officials, including the intelligence and foreign ministers, commanders of the elite Revolutionary Guard military units, and diplomats at the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires at the time. It accuses them of planning, directing, and otherwise participating in the bombing. The court also issued an arrest warrant for a Hezbollah security chief, who was assassinated in a car bomb attack in 2008. Hashemi-Rafsanjani died in January 2017.</p>\n<p>\tInterpol has issued red notice alerts for six of these men to determine their location and detain, arrest, or restrict their movement “for the purpose of extradition, surrender, or similar lawful action.” Iran has repeatedly denied its involvement in the attack, refused to extradite the men to Argentina, and sought to lift the Interpol notices. No extradition treaty exists between Iran and Argentina.</p>\n<p>\tIn 2015, an Argentine court began a separate trial of several officials – including former President Carlos Menem, and a judge – for their alleged interference with the initial investigation into the bombing.</p>\n<p>\tThe investigation concerning Fernández de Kirchner, Timerman, and others began in January 2015 when prosecutor Alberto Nisman accused them of conspiring with Iran to undermine the investigation. Days later, he was found dead in his home with a single gunshot wound to the head and a pistol beside him matching the wound. Courts have yet to determine whether Nisman’s death was suicide or murder. A Gendarmerie report published in September said Nisman had been murdered.</p>\n<p>\tBonadio said in his recent indictment that he has yet to analyze thousands of emails and hundreds of phone calls presumably relevant to the case. Any evidence that the Kirchner administration engaged in crimes in its negotiations with Iran should be seriously taken into consideration, yet Bonadio’s 491-page indictment provides no convincing evidence of any such crimes.</p>\n<p>\tFernández de Kirchner is also facing prosecution in five alleged corruption cases, including four in which she has been indicted. Timerman is not facing any other charges.</p>\n<p>\t“Any official who engaged in corruption should be appropriately prosecuted, but Bonadio’s unreasonable charges do little to advance the cause of justice in Argentina,” Vivanco said.</p>",

The local authority has invested huge sums to acquire new housing for those made homeless by the fire. A <a href=\"https://www.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/\">public inquiry began preliminary hearings this month</a>. The London Metropolitan Police is carrying out a criminal investigation into companies who refurbished Grenfell Tower, that could lead to corporate manslaughter charges. A government-ordered expert review of building and fire safety regulations has already published interim findings. And local authorities have acted to improve fire safety in similar high-rise social housing blocks they own.</p>\n<p>But look deeper and things are not going so well.</p>\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21732558-council-admits-it-faces-battle-regain-peoples-trust-six-months-grenfell\">mid-December, challenges finding suitable and acceptable permanent housing mean more than 100 families caught up in the Grenfell disaster were still in temporary housing</a>. Most will likely spend Christmas there.</p>\n<p>The public inquiry has struggled to gain the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/940328345832738817\">confidence of the community affected by Grenfell</a>, which is vital to its success. A request for community members to join the chair’s panel of advisors has yet to be accepted. And <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/following-grenfell/following-grenfell-why-commission-involved\">a request by the national human rights commission to be a party to the inquiry has been rejected</a>, making it less likely that human rights will be at the centre of its work.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-interim-report\">interim expert report has found that the whole system of fire regulation is, “not fit for purpose,”</a> and while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/grenfell-tower-delays-and-trauma-mark-painfully-slow-progress\">some local authorities have pledged to install sprinklers in high-rise blocks</a> (a safety measure recommended in the wake of a similar, less deadly fire in London), others are still looking at the issue.</p>\n<p>But putting human rights at the heart of the Grenfell Tower response makes it more likely that authorities will meet the needs of victims. Importantly, it could also help to prevent future disasters.</p>",

Videos show police officers beating people with batons, and two videos showed police officers in separate incidents <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uALnQMZtxMA\">kicking people as they lay on the ground</a>.</p>\n<p>All seven witnesses said that police appeared to use force on protesters who were not violent or were in custody, and against journalists. One protester said that police kicked him in the back and legs and hit him with batons as he was attempting to help a person who had fallen unconscious.</p>\n<p>“I remember officers just stampeding people and just starting to beat people who were already on the floor, they were going after everyone,” said one witness. “They weren’t differentiating between people who were part of the protest and media.”</p>\n<p>Witnesses and journalists also said that police told them they were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=MpHS7owDxno\">not allowed to film</a> or take photos. One journalist said that police fired a rubber bullet directly at him from less than five meters away, for which he was treated at a hospital. He said police hit journalists, knocked their cameras to the ground, and told them they were not allowed to photograph the protest. Another journalist said that a police officer hit her with a baton as she was trying to film.</p>\n<p>Lebanese media reported on December 15 that <a href=\"http://nna-leb.gov.lb/ar/show-news/319733/\">six protesters, including a child, appeared before the Military Tribunal</a> on charges of rioting, assaulting police, and destruction of property. Human Rights Watch opposes the use of military courts to try civilians and children, and has found that such trials in Lebanon <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/26/lebanon-civilians-tried-military-courts\">do not respect due process rights and violate international law</a>.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch and local human rights organizations have long documented the unlawful use of force by security agencies against protesters in Lebanon. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/21/lebanon-hold-soldiers-who-beat-protesters-account\">Lebanese military personnel beat and kicked protesters</a> demonstrating against a third extension of parliament’s term on June 16, 2017. And on August 22 and 23, 2015, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/22/lebanon-police-violence-against-protesters\">Lebanese security personnel used rubber bullets, teargas canisters, water cannons, rifle butts, and batons</a> at a protest in downtown Beirut over a waste management crisis and corruption.</p>\n<p>Impunity for violence by security forces is a recurring problem in Lebanon. Even when officials have initiated investigations into previous incidents of excessive, and in some cases, lethal violence against protesters, the investigations have often not been concluded or made public. Although the Lebanese army announced an investigation into the June 16 incident, it has not made the results public.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officers are permitted to use force to disperse protests that turn violent. But the development and deployment of nonlethal incapacitating weapons <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/UseOfForceAndFirearms.aspx\">should be carefully evaluated to minimize the risk of endangering people</a> who are not involved and the use of such weapons should be carefully controlled. Whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials must exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offense and the legitimate objective to be achieved, while minimizing damage and injury.</p>\n<p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Lebanon in 1972, has called on governments to ensure that regulations governing the use of force and weapons by police conform fully with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms and that “any violations of these rules be systematically investigated in order to bring those found to have committed such acts before the courts; and that those found guilty be punished and the victims be compensated.” Lebanese authorities should allow an independent review of police conduct during the demonstrations, and use maximum restraint in response to protests.</p>\n<p>“Although police can use force to control a protest in certain cases, that does not mean they have the right to use it against protesters and journalists indiscriminately,” Fakih said. “International donors funding the Internal Security Forces should pay careful attention to how their money is being used.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

The massacre was part of the military’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/rohingya-crisis\">campaign of ethnic cleansing</a> that has forced more than <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/11/burma-rohingya-return-deal-bad-refugees\">645,000 Rohingya to flee</a> to neighboring Bangladesh since late August.</p>\n<p>The 30-page report, “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/node/312636\">Massacre by the River: Burmese Army Crimes against Humanity in Tula Toli</a>,” details the security force attack on several thousand villagers in Tula Toli, known officially as Min Gyi.

On the morning of August 30, hundreds of uniformed Burmese soldiers and armed ethnic Rakhine villagers arrived in Tula Toli. Rohingya villagers, including residents of neighboring areas who had escaped to Tula Toli following attacks on their towns in previous days, fled to the wide bank of the river that borders the village on three sides. Many villagers told Human Rights Watch that the ethnic Rakhine local chairman had told them to gather at the beach, where he said they would be safe.</p>\n<p>Security forces then surrounded the area, shooting at the gathered crowd and those attempting to flee. They separated men and women, holding the women and children under guard in shallow water while systematically shooting the men or hacking them to death with knives. Shawfika, 24, who saw her husband and father-in-law killed, said the killings on the beach went on for hours:</p>\n<blockquote><p>They just kept catching men, making them kneel down and killing them. Then they put their bodies on a pile. First they shot them, and if they were still alive they were killed with machetes.… It took them one-and-a-half hours to carry all the bodies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the afternoon, hundreds had been killed on the riverbank. Soldiers and Rakhine villagers burned the bodies in deep pits dug in the sand, in an apparent effort to destroy evidence of the killings.</p>\n<p>Survivors described young children being pulled away from their mothers and killed – thrown into fires or the river, or beaten or knifed to death on the ground. Hassina Begum, 20, tried to hide her 1-year-old daughter, Sohaifa, under her headscarf, but a soldier noticed. “He took my daughter from me and threw her alive into the fire,” she said. “What could I do?… He had a knife in his hand and a rifle over his shoulder.”</p>\n<p>Soldiers brought women and children to nearby houses in small groups, where many were raped and sexually assaulted, stabbed, and beaten. Nine women and girls interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they were raped or sexually assaulted, and witnessed the rape of others. Afterward, soldiers locked the houses and set them on fire, leaving the women and children inside, most unconscious or dead. Shawfika described escaping the burning house:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I woke up and realized I was in a pool of sticky blood. I tried to wake the others up but they didn’t move. Then I broke through the [bamboo] wall and escaped.… All the houses in the area were on fire. I could hear women screaming from some of the other houses. They could not escape from the fires.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shawfika, like many other women interviewed, was the only survivor from the group of eight women and children whom soldiers forced into the house. Witness accounts suggest that the pattern of rape and killings in the houses was repeated many times.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312651\">\n<img alt=\"746 buildings destroyed in Tula Toli\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_burma_tulatoli_img001.jpg?itok=OWxfNgMN 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_burma_tulatoli_img001.jpg?itok=4rJh_cSq 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_burma_tulatoli_img001.jpg?itok=G_bvVuED 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/946w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_burma_tulatoli_img001.jpg?itok=2yK82Ti5 946w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_burma_tulatoli_img001.jpg?itok=qK925Lmv 1070w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_burma_tulatoli_img001.jpg?itok=843zjMFN\"> </a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/17/burma-40-rohingya-villages-burned-october\">Satellite imagery analyzed</a> by Human Rights Watch confirms that the Rohingya villages of Tula Toli and nearby Dual Toli were completely destroyed by arson – a total of 746 buildings – while the neighboring non-Rohingya villages remain intact.

A few minutes later, they took the bodies of the children and threw them on a fire outside.</p>\n<p>Then the soldiers raped all three of us women. I was on my back [being raped] for an hour. It was four or five soldiers.… They beat us all until we were half dead, and then they set the house on fire. I saw that one of the corners of the bamboo wall had a hole in it. I made it bigger by kicking it, and I escaped from the house. No one else came out of that house.

Then they were hitting the children. They stripped us naked, searching for our valuables. It is all blurry, but I remember them beating my 10-year-old sister-in-law – they hit her in the head with a big stick. Her face was swelling up and she was just screaming loudly in pain. Then she was just breathing loudly, and then she was barely breathing. And then she died.</p>\n<p>The house was already on fire when I woke up. I saw another woman on fire. She tried to stand up, but she fell down again. Burning objects were falling on us from the roof. So I stood up and stepped over the bodies of the others, and broke the [bamboo] wall with my leg and escaped. The other woman burned to death inside.

Aceh, the only Indonesian province that can legally adopt bylaws derived from Sharia, makes male and female same-sex conduct a criminal offense.</p>\n<p>Local officials have made matters worse by aggressively stoking homophobia. In 2013, Banda Aceh mayor <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBQLV4Vwn7D/\">Illiza Saaduddin</a> <a href=\"http://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2013/05/05/kaum-gay-mulai-merambah-banda-aceh\">declared</a> that “homosexuals are encroaching on our city.” In February 2016, Saaduddin posted to Instagram a photo of herself holding a handgun and vowing to purge Aceh of LGBT people. That same month, she <a href=\"http://aceh.tribunnews.com/2016/02/27/pemko-bentuk-tim-pencegahan-lgbt\">announced</a> she would create a “special team” to boost public awareness of the “threat of LGBT” people and to “train” LGBT people to “return to a normal life.”</p>\n<p>But Saaduddin is only part of the problem. In October 2015, Sharia police <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/02/indonesia-suspected-lesbians-detained\">arrested two women</a> on suspicion of being lesbians, detaining them for three nights before imposing on them a week of “religious rehab.” In <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/08/10/these-political-games-ruin-our-lives/indonesias-lgbt-community-under-threat\">2016, after senior government officials fomented an anti-LGBT crisis with </a>a stream of rhetoric that demeaned and threatened Indonesia’s LGBT population, authorities in one Acehnese city <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/indonesia0816_web_2.pdf#page=63\">urged</a> employers not to hire LGBT people.</p>\n<p>Aceh’s abusive anti-LGBT policies have generated international opprobrium. Last May’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/24/public-floggings-indonesia-top-500\">public flogging</a> of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/12/sparing-rod-indonesia\">two gay men</a> in Aceh—Indonesia’s first public caning for homosexuality—sparked outrage far beyond Indonesia’s borders. In 2016, United Nations experts <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/08/10/these-political-games-ruin-our-lives/indonesias-lgbt-community-under-threat\">wrote to the Indonesian government</a> expressing concerns about the abusive enforcement of Sharia against LGBT people in Aceh. While Indonesia has yet to <a href=\"https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/Tmsearch/TMDocuments\">respond</a> to this, in September it informed the UN Human Rights Council that it would “take further steps to ensure a safe and enabling environment for all human rights defenders,” including LGBT activists. It has yet to back its pledge with action.  </p>\n<p>Despite Indonesian leaders’ frequent touting of the country’s <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/02/05/komnas-ham-slams-vilification-lgbt-officials.html#sthash.xRWYvQPu.dpuf\">diversity and pluralism</a>, many of Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/16/indonesias-president-jokowi-silent-human-rights-0\">minorities</a> remain vulnerable to harassment, intimidation, and violence. Last weekend’s detention of friends attending a birthday party is just the latest example of this. The government should condemn this vigilantism, but will Jakarta speak out?</p>",

In one of the last videos Hua recorded, police can be heard banging on his door, ordering him to open it.</p>\n<p>Hua was released on bail three days later, but he could still face criminal charges.</p>\n<p>Since mid-November, after a fire in an overcrowded and unsafe apartment building in Beijing killed 19 people, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/08/asia/china-migrant-workers-evictions-beijing/index.html\">Beijing authorities have launched a campaign to clear out tenants</a> from buildings on the city’s outskirts that did not meet the safety code. While moving people from such premises may have been necessary, the authorities should not have evicted tens of thousands of migrant workers with little or no notice. At first, photos of evicted migrant workers in Beijing’s bitter weather, clutching their belongings, went viral on the internet, causing a public outcry. But authorities soon censored media coverage of the event. Nevertheless, Hua documented the evictions, posting on YouTube and other websites dozens of videos he shot using his cell phone.</p>\n<p>Chinese activists, human rights lawyers, and those who speak critically of the government have come to expect the police arriving at their door to take them into custody, search their belongings, or just to harass them. One night in August 2015, Tianjin <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/18/china-breaks-human-rights-lawyer\">police ransacked defense lawyer Li Chunfu’s home and arrested him</a>.

In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42379722\">one of his videos, Hua addresses his daughter</a>: “Everything Dad did was for your generation, so you wouldn't have to experience what your fathers and grandfathers have experienced.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>(Beirut)—The mass conviction on November 27, 2017, of more than 60 people involved in demonstrations at <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/kuwait\">Kuwait</a>’s parliament in 2011 included convictions for assembly and speech, Human Rights Watch said today. Kuwait’s judiciary should vacate the convictions that punished peaceful speech or assembly and repeal laws criminalizing peaceful speech and protest.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch reviewed the 182-page Court of Appeals <a href=\"http://www.arkanlaw.com/images/library_book/QI5vu.%E2%80%8E%E2%81%A8%D8%AF%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%84%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3%E2%81%A9.pdf\">decision</a>, which found 67 people guilty of a range of charges, sentencing them to between one and nine years in prison with labor, including opposition leader Musallam al-Barrack who was sentenced to nine years. The vast majority received sentences for using force against police, but the court also found 65 people guilty of participating in an unlicensed public assembly or gathering, and 16 of crimes that appear to violate free speech, including insulting the emir and offending police. The court sentenced one defendant to an additional two years on charges of insulting the Emir and offending police alone.</p>\n<p>“These heavy-handed sentences smack of intimidation and retaliation for criticism of authorities,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/lama-fakih\">Lama Fakih</a>, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Regulating protests is one thing, but sentencing people to prison for offending the authorities only serves to intimidate others from speaking out.”</p>\n<p>Kuwait frequently prosecutes people for speech offenses, such as for offending the authorities. Human Rights Watch maintains an interactive <a href=\"https://features.hrw.org/features/HRW_2016_reports/140_Characters/index.html#en/kuwait\">website featuring some of the high-profile cases.</a></p>\n<p>In November 2011, during the so-called Arab Spring, the protesters reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-protest/protesters-storm-kuwait-assembly-demanding-pm-quit-idUSTRE7AF2RL20111116\">entered Kuwait’s parliament</a> building as hundreds of people demonstrated outside, calling on Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah to step down over corruption claims. In response, Kuwait’s emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said the protest had been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/17/kuwait-protesters-storm-parliament\">threat to the country’s security and stability</a> and called for stricter security measures. In December 2013, a Kuwaiti <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-25297907\">court had cleared the protesters,</a> who included members of parliament, of all charges. But prosecutors appealed to the Court of Appeals, leading to the mass convictions.</p>\n<p>One of the defense lawyers told Human Rights Watch that the people convicted on November 27 had appealed the sentence to the Court of Cassation. He said that more than 30 defendants had already turned themselves in and that police had arrested two others.</p>\n<p>Kuwaiti authorities have long-restricted freedom of assembly and expression, and should repeal laws that criminalize peaceful assembly and expression, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>Kuwaiti authorities have invoked several provisions in the constitution, penal code, Printing and Publication Law, Misuse of Telephone Communications and Bugging Devices Law, Public Gatherings Law, and National Unity Law to prosecute journalists, politicians, and activists for criticizing the emir, the government, religion, and rulers of neighboring countries in blogs or on Twitter, Facebook, or other social media.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Kuwait amended the election law to bar all those convicted for “insulting” God, the prophets, or the emir from running for office or voting in elections. The law is likely to bar some opposition members of parliament from running for office or voting in future elections.</p>\n<p>The Cybercrime Law, which went into effect in 2016, includes far-reaching restrictions on internet-based speech, such as prison sentences, and fines for insulting religion, religious figures, and the emir.</p>\n<p>“These convictions come amid a clampdown on freedom of expression and assembly across the Middle East,” Whitson said. “Kuwait should be setting itself apart in the region as a tolerant and open country that respects freedom of expression and protest and dissenting views.”</p>",

On November 25, satellite data detected an active fire and building destruction in Myo Mi Chang village in Rakhine State’s Maungdaw Township. Four villages suffered building destruction between November 25 and December 2.</p>\n<p>“The Burmese army’s destruction of Rohingya villages within days of signing a refugee repatriation agreement with Bangladesh shows that commitments to safe returns were just a public relations stunt,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/brad-adams\">Brad Adams</a>, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The satellite imagery shows what the Burmese army denies: that Rohingya villages continue to be destroyed. Burmese government pledges to ensure the safety of returning Rohingya cannot be taken seriously.”</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has used satellite imagery to assess and monitor over 1,000 villages and towns in the townships of Maungdaw, Buthidaung, and Rathiduang, where the Burmese military and vigilantes have engaged in attacks on Rohingya. Human Rights  Watch found that the damage patterns in the 354 affected villages are consistent with burning occurring in the weeks after the military operations began in late August.</p>\n<p>Of the 354 affected villages, at least 118 were either partially or completely destroyed after September 5 -- the date the Burmese State Counsellor’s office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar-rohingya-crisis-concerned\">announced as the end of clearance operations</a>. Of the 40 new villages with building destruction identified by Human Rights Watch, 24 were destroyed in October, 11 in November, and 5 over both months.</p>\n<p>The latest documented arson attacks occurred between November 25 and December 2 in four villages. Satellite data from environmental sensors detected an active fire at 12:30 p.m. in the Rohingya village of Myo Mi Chang in Maungdaw Township on November 25. Building destruction was concentrated in the center of the village, which was undamaged until this attack. Other villages subjected to arson attacks during this period include Nga/Myin Baw, Goke Pi, and an unknown village in the village tract of Zee Pin Chaung.</p>\n<p>On November 23, Bangladesh and Burma signed an Arrangement on Return of Displaced Persons from Rakhine State on behalf of “residents of Rakhine State” who crossed from Burma into Bangladesh after October 9, 2016 and August 25, 2017. In <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/11/burma-rohingya-return-deal-bad-refugees\">letters to both governments</a>, Human Rights Watch said the agreement should be shelved, noting the lack of involvement by the United Nations and the unrealistic timetable for safe and voluntary returns starting in January 2018.</p>\n<p>Since late August, the Burmese military has committed widespread <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/rohingya-crisis\">killings, rapes, arbitrary arrests, and mass arson </a>in hundreds of predominantly Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine State, forcing more than <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/iscg-situation-update-rohingya-refugee-crisis-cox-s-bazar-14-december-2017\">655,000 Rohingya</a> to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. Human Rights Watch has found that this campaign of ethnic cleansing amounts to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/25/burma-military-commits-crimes-against-humanity\">crimes against humanity</a>. Attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) armed group on 30 security force outposts and an army base that <a href=\"http://www.statecounsellor.gov.mm/en/node/1005\">killed</a> 11 Burmese security personnel set off the Burmese military “clearance operations” against the Rohingya.</p>\n<p>In November, a Burmese army “investigation team” <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Cincds/posts/1511217488999111\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> concluded that there were “no deaths of innocent people” during the military operation in Rakhine State, and that at least 376 “terrorists” were killed during fighting, contrary to information reported by the UN, media outlets, and human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch. The humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) on December 14 <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/en/article/myanmarbangladesh-msf-surveys-estimate-least-6700-rohingya-were-killed-during-attacks\">concluded that at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the violence</a>, over 700 of whom were children, based on survey data of refugees in Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>“The UN Security Council and concerned governments shouldn’t continue to stand by as evidence of continuing attacks on the Rohingya community comes to light,” Adams said. “Targeted sanctions need to be imposed now against those responsible for ordering and carrying out crimes against humanity.” </p>",

March 8, 2014.</p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2014 Iraqi al-Amal Association</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">\n<p>(Beirut) – <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/middle-eastn-africa/iraq\">Iraq’s</a> parliament has <a href=\"http://www.nrttv.com/Ar/Detail.aspx?Jimare=62698\">rejected proposed amendments</a> to Iraq’s <a href=\"http://almasalah.com/ar/news/ar/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=18949\">Personal Status Law (PSL)</a> that would allow religious judges to impose discriminatory law on family matters, Human Rights Watch said today.</p>\n<p>The amendments would have covered areas including inheritance and divorce, and, by giving powers to impose family laws to certain religious communities, would have allowed girls to be married as young as age 8 under some of these laws. The head of the women’s rights committee in parliament rejected the initiative in mid-November, blocking the bill. However, two leading women’s rights organizations say that some parliament members have threatened to continue to push for the amendments to secure votes in some parts of the country in the May 2018 parliamentary elections.</p>\n<p>“Parliament’s women’s rights committee has made a great contribution to Iraqi society in rejecting this effort to scuttle Iraq’s family law protections,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/belkis-wille\">Belkis Wille</a>, senior Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Threats by lawmakers to dismantle protections under the current law and restore discriminatory laws would be devastating to women’s rights.”</p>\n<p>Parliament members from several Shia Islamic parties, spearheaded by the Fadhila Party, to which the justice minister belongs, proposed the amendments on November 1. The proposed amendments would enshrine Shia and Sunni religious establishment control over marriage-related matters and require courts to make exceptions to existing legal protections.</p>\n<p>Hanaa Edwar, founder and general secretary of Al-Amal Association, a leading Iraqi human rights organization, and a member of the Human Rights Watch Middle East Advisory Committee, said the members also threatened to continue to push for the amendments unless the women’s rights committee dropped key protections in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/19/iraq-strengthen-domestic-violence-bill\">domestic violence bill</a> pending before parliament since 2015.</p>\n<p>“The proposed amendments seek to establish sectarianism and undermine the principle of citizenship and national identity of Iraq,” Edwar told Human Rights Watch. “The amendments would violate key rights enshrined in Iraq’s constitution and laws, and would treat women as inferior to men.”</p>\n<p>The current law applies to everyone regardless of their religious affiliation, and is administered by Iraq’s secular court system. The proposed amendments instead would require the secular courts to apply religious law on marriage, divorce, and inheritance. The amendments also recommend – but do not require – establishing specialized Personal Status Courts, headed by religious judges, to adjudicate family law issues.</p>\n<p>The current law sets the legal age for marriage at 18, but allows a judge to permit girls as young as 15 to be married in “urgent” cases. According to a <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_SOWC_2016.pdf\">2016 The United Nations Childrens’ Fund (UNICEF) report</a>, 5 percent of Iraqi children are married by age 15, and 24 percent by age 18. According to a women’s rights lawyer, this is because many families arrange marriages through religious marriage contracts outside the legal system, though they are illegal.</p>\n<p>The amendments also would undermine protections for divorced women. Under the current law, if a husband requests a divorce, the wife has the right to remain in their marital home for three years at the husband’s expense and to receive two years of maintenance and the current value of her dowry. If a wife requests a divorce, a judge can award her some of these benefits depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Because religious law offers fewer protections, under the proposed amendments, women would have lost many of these protections. For example, under the Jaafari Shia school of law, the woman has no right to the marital home, maintenance, or her dowry and children remain living with her for only two years, regardless of their age, during which she is not allowed to remarry.</p>\n<p>Women would also lose some inheritance rights. Even under existing law, daughters inherit a lower proportion of a parent’s wealth than sons. But under some religious laws, daughters would inherit even less and if the family has no son to inherit the agricultural land, it would revert to the state.</p>\n<p>“The current personal status law was drafted by taking the most rights-upholding aspects of the different sects in Iraq,” Yanar Mohammed, president of the Organization of Women’s Freedom in Iraq, told Human Rights Watch. “The push for these amendments is part of a political game linked to the upcoming May 2018 parliamentary elections.”</p>\n<p>She said that while the driving forces behind these amendments came from a group of Shia Islamic parties, she feared that some Sunni members of parliament would also support them to give the clergy more authority over daily life. This is the second attempt in recent years to introduce discriminatory religious personal status laws. In February <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/11/iraq-dont-legalize-marriage-9-year-olds\">2014 the Council of Ministers approved a draft law</a>, the “Jaafari Personal Status Law,” which would have covered Iraq’s Shia citizens and residents, prohibited them from marrying non-Muslims, effectively legalized marital rape, prevented women from leaving the house without their husbands’ permission, and allowed girls younger than 9 to be married with a parent’s approval. After pressure from local human rights activists, parliament did not move the bill forward.</p>\n<p>These new proposed amendments violate the <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-8&chapter=4&lang=en\">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</a> (CEDAW), which Iraq ratified in 1986, by giving fewer rights to women and girls on the basis of their gender. They also violate the <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-11&chapter=4&lang=en\">Convention on Rights of the Child</a>, which Iraq ratified in 1994, by legalizing child marriage, putting girls at risk of forced and early marriage and susceptible to sexual abuse, and not requiring decisions about children in divorce cases to be made in the best interests of the child. The draft amendments appear to violate the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by granting fewer rights to certain people on the basis of their religion.</p>\n<p>The draft amendments also starkly contrast with <a href=\"http://www.cabinet.iq/PageViewer.aspx?id=2\">article 14 of Iraq’s constitution</a>, which prohibits “discrimination and distinction between Iraqis” and guarantees the equality of all Iraqis “without distinction to religion, faith, nationality, sex, opinion, economic or social status.” Article 13 of Iraq’s constitution stipulates that it is the “supreme law” in Iraq and that “no law that contradicts this Constitution shall be enacted.”</p>\n<p>The CEDAW committee, the body of international experts who review state compliance with CEDAW, concluded in 2013 that, “identity-based personal status laws and customs perpetuate discrimination against women and that the preservation of multiple legal systems is in itself discriminatory against women.”</p>\n<p>In its 2013 review, the CEDAW committee has previously recommended that Iraq repeal discriminatory legal exceptions to the minimum age of marriage for girls. It said that legal exceptions to the minimum age of marriage should be granted only in exceptional cases and authorized by a competent court for both girls and boys, and only in cases in which they are at least 16 and give their express consent.</p>\n<p>“While lawmakers may have failed this time around, the threat of these terrible amendments still looms, and is being used as leverage to try to whittle away at key human rights protections in the domestic violence law,” Wille said. “Iraqi parliamentarians should reject these efforts to reverse the progress Iraqi society has made in creating laws that protect all of its citizens.</p>\n</div>",

The regulations require all INGOs to register and obtain prior permission from the Ministry of Interior to carry out any activities in the country, and restrict their operations to specific issues and geographical areas. The ministry is broadly empowered to cancel registrations on grounds of “involvement in any activity inconsistent with Pakistan’s national interests, or contrary to Government policy”—terms that have vague meanings and can be used for political reasons to target critical organizations or individuals.</p>\n<p>Pakistan’s government has the responsibility to prevent fraud, financial malfeasance, and other illegal activities by INGOs, but Pakistan already has other laws and regulations that address such concerns. The INGO regulations severely restrict rights to freedom of association and expression for Pakistanis working for INGOs, as well as for foreign nationals. These rights are protected under the Pakistani constitution and international human rights law.</p>\n<p>International groups make significant contributions to Pakistan in safeguarding and promoting health, nutrition, education, sanitation, food security, and the rule of law and human rights, among many other areas. International humanitarian and development organizations working in Pakistan employ thousands of Pakistanis, contribute hundreds of millions of US dollars to the national economy, and, working alongside their local partners, reach an estimated <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://pakhumanitarianforum.org/ngos-in-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\">20 million Pakistanis</a> with assistance and services every year.</p>\n<p>Under the regulations, all international organizations are required to obtain permission in advance from a government “INGO committee” chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Interior before carrying out any activity in Pakistan. The committee has the power to rescind that permission at any time, for vaguely defined reasons.</p>\n<p>The regulations provide for a right of appeal only on decisions by the INGO committee to cancel registration. The appeals process, to a Special Ministerial Committee, will be final, denying the groups any recourse through an independent judicial process.</p>\n<p>The Pakistani government should revise the policy for INGOs so that it does not contravene the rights to freedom of expression and association, and cannot be misused for political reasons to restrict the peaceful activities of nongovernmental organizations.</p>\n<p>“The recent action against nongovernmental organizations comes amidst a shrinking space for free expression and dissenting voices,” Adams said. “Placing arbitrary restrictions on international groups is likely to increase the climate of fear for domestic organizations.”</p>",

He said he had seen the prison doctor after symptoms that included “drooping on the left side of his face.” Shahabi told his family that the doctor told him that he had probably had a mini-stroke, but that the doctor had not conducted any further medical examinations or follow-up.</p>\n<p>“Allowing Reza Shahabi’s health to deteriorate further in prison, especially when he was imprisoned solely for his peaceful activism in the first place, is just cruel,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Leah Whitson</a>, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Iranian authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Shahabi.”</p>\n<p>Shahabi’s union said that medical experts who had examined Shahabi before had determined that Shahahi should not continue to serve his prison sentence due to his medical condition.</p>\n<p>Since 2005, authorities have repeatedly harassed, summoned, arrested, and sentenced workers who are affiliated with independent trade unions in Iran.</p>\n<p>Authorities first arrested Shahabi, 45, for his activities as a member of the SWTSBC on June 12, 2010. Branch 15 of Tehran’s revolutionary court sentenced him to six years in prison and deprived him of “social rights” such as holding a public office or working in any governmental organizations, for five more years on charges of “conspiracy and collusion to act against national security” and “propaganda against the state.”</p>\n<p>In May 2014, authorities released Shahabi on medical furlough, with the promise that he would not need to return to prison, Center for Human Rights in Iran reported. After being released from prison, Shahabi, who had been fired from his job, began working at a small mini-market with his wife.</p>\n<p>On August 7, 2017, Shahabi returned to prison to serve the remainder of his prison sentence after receiving several warnings from the judiciary that he would lose his bail if he refused to go back.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, authorities have sent back to prison several prominent trade unionists sentenced for peaceful activities but then later released on bail. They include Ismael Abdi, the Teachers’ Union secretary general, on June 7, and Mahmoud Beheshti Langeroudi, the Teachers’ Union’s spokesperson, on September 13.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/21/iran-imprisoned-physicists-cancer-care-jeopardy\" target=\"_blank\">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22017&LangID=E\">United Nations Experts</a>, and other human rights organizations have documented numerous occasions on which authorities deprived prisoners in Iran of needed care. In August, several prisoners charged with vaguely defined national security charges, including Shahabi, embarked on a hunger strike in Rajai Shahr prison to protest the conditions of their detention, including a lack of access to medical care.</p>\n<p>International and Iranian law require prison authorities to provide adequate medical care. Iran’s state prison organization regulations state that, if necessary, detainees must be transferred to a hospital outside the prison facility. The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners require authorities to transfer all those held needing specialist medical treatment to specialized institutions, including civilian hospitals</p>",

Should Twitter disobey, <a href=\"https://www.khodorkovsky.com/russian-authorities-threaten-ban-twitter-open-russia/\">the notice warns</a>, it may be blocked in Russia. YouTube received <a href=\"https://www.khodorkovsky.com/kremlin-launches-assault-youtube-delete-open-russia-face-nationwide-ban/\">an almost identical warning </a>, also threatening them with a Russia-wide ban.</p>\n<p>Russia has adopted a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/18/russia-assault-freedom-expression\">plethora of repressive laws</a> restricting online expression in recent years. <a href=\"http://sozd.parlament.gov.ru/bill/275060-7\">The most recent one</a> empowered the Prosecutor General’s office to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/30/russia-punished-over-hyperlinks\">block content</a> shared by foreign “undesirable” organizations as well as websites disseminating materials from these organizations. Since 2015, Russian authorities have <a href=\"http://minjust.ru/ru/activity/nko/unwanted\">designated 11 groups</a> as “undesirable”, mostly US donor groups, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/russian-authorities-ban-khodorkovskys-organization-open-russia-as-undesirable/\">adding the UK-registered Open Russia</a> and affiliated groups to the list in April.</p>\n<p>On December 11, Roskomnadzor, acting on orders of the Prosecutor General’s office, <a href=\"https://www.khodorkovsky.com/russian-authorities-move-ban-open-russia-online-resources/\">blocked Open Russia’s website</a> and several other affiliated sources. On December 12 and 13, official requests to Twitter, YouTube, and Odnoklassniki, a Russian social media platform, to block their accounts followed. So far, only Odnoklassniki <a href=\"https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2017/12/12/137819-odnoklassniki-zablokirovali-gruppu-otkrytoy-rossii\">complied</a> and blocked Open Russia’s page. Roskomnadzor said <a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5a327a6d9a794744bd6803bb\">action to block Twitter and YouTube</a> is postponed pending “negotiations.”</p>\n<p>Russia has made similar threats in the past, threatening to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-telegram-regulator-idUSKBN19E0H4\">block Telegram</a> messenger service and <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-threatens-to-block-facebook-if-it-doesnt-store-user-information-in-the-country-2017-9\">Facebook</a>. Some of the laws Russia adopted in recent years – such as one <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/18/online-and-all-fronts/russias-assault-freedom-expression\">requiring all data</a> on Russia users to be stored in Russia, or the law which effectively requires companies <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/18/online-and-all-fronts/russias-assault-freedom-expression\">to hand over encryption keys</a> to security services – are nearly impossible to implement on a technical level, not to mention <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/18/russia-assault-freedom-expression\">detrimental</a> to free expression.</p>\n<p>So far, Russian authorities have mostly stopped short of implementing these threats. Although Russia <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38014501\">blocked LinkedIn</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/01/russia-new-legislation-attacks-internet-anonymity\">several messaging apps</a> for non-compliance, the scale of blocking <a>Facebook</a> or Twitter is far greater and the fallout very different. One thing is for certain: Russia’s internet laws are designed to stifle free speech, and can and are being used to go after government critics or online debate on certain topics. And to make it even easier for the authorities, the laws enable them to block anything they want, any time they want – without the hassle of getting a court order.</p>",

But it’s also a scathing indictment of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/united-states\">US</a> government efforts to roll back poverty and mitigate its worst human rights impacts. He slams the country’s “confused and counterproductive” <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/every-25-seconds/human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states\">drug laws</a> and their impact on the poor, accuses <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/04/criminalization-poverty-driver-poverty-united-states\">state and local governments of relying on criminalization</a> not only to “conceal the problem” of poverty, but also to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/01/07/profit-justice-means-taxing-poor\">raise revenue off the backs of the poor</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/business/economy/tax-plan-standard-of-living.html?_r=0\">tax plan working its way through Congress</a> is likely to, “stake out America’s bid to become the most unequal society in the world,” he warns.</p>\n<p>Poverty, and the government’s role in addressing it, generates considerable political debate in the US, but there is rarely any reference to the idea that <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/openglobalrights/economic-inequality-and-human-rights\">poverty and inequality are human rights issues</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx\">US has not ratified the international treaties</a> that enshrine many of the rights most directly impacted by extremes of poverty and wealth, like <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Education/SREducation/Pages/SREducationIndex.aspx\">education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Health/Pages/SRRightHealthIndex.aspx\">health</a>. It clings to the Cold War fixation that human rights encompass only the civil and political, and not the economic, social, and cultural entitlements that are just as central to the idea of human dignity as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>\n<p>US law reinforces these gaps instead of helping to bridge them. The US Supreme Court has held that there is <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/411/1.html\">no constitutional right to an education</a>, let alone a quality one, and has never held that there is a <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMhle1412262\">right to health care</a> either. Alston describes the US as being almost alone in, “insisting that while human rights are of fundamental importance, they do not include rights that guard against dying of hunger, dying from a lack of access to affordable health care, or growing up in a context of total deprivation.”</p>\n<p>One of the most frustrating things about Alston’s report is its pointed reminder that there already exists a legal framework – bolstered by <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CESCR/Pages/CESCRIndex.aspx\">decades’ worth of practical guidance</a> – that describes how governments should address problems affecting peoples’ health, education, and overall well-being. The US has so far steadfastly refused to take advantage of it, but as Alston notes, “denial does not eliminate responsibility.”</p>",

Department officials emphasized that “no category of removable aliens would be exempt from enforcement.”</p>\n<p>These numbers are nothing to crow about. The surge in these arrests doesn’t just mean that US Immigration and Enforcement (ICE) is working harder. It means ICE is uprooting more immigrants who have lived in the US for many years and separating more families.</p>\n<p>The Barcenas family is just one example. David Barcenas, who was brought to the US when he was 2 years old, was deported in May after almost 30 years in the US. He met Melissa, a US citizen, in 2008 and they quickly became a family with her two daughters from a previous relationship and their two children who came soon afterward. They were very much an American family. They had a happy life in Victoria, Texas, a routine of church on Sundays, followed by visits to the park or weekend trips to Corpus Christi.</p>\n<p>But after a traffic stop, local police discovered that David was driving without a license. He was quickly arrested by immigration authorities and soon after deported to Mexico, a country he hardly remembered. His most serious run-in with law enforcement had been a conviction for driving under the influence over 10 years earlier. Since his deportation, Melissa has struggled emotionally and financially to take care of their children. “We cry daily for him. It doesn’t get easier with time,” she told us. David’s stepdaughter, Alyssa, said, “It feels like our family’s broken.”</p>\n<p>David wasn’t eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals because of the DUI, but he could have benefited from the DREAM Act.</p>\n<p>Stories like Melissa and David’s are not unique. Our staff and volunteers interviewed recently deported immigrants in Nuevo Laredo and Tijuana, Mexico, during multiple visits to the border over eight months. We documented 43 cases of immigrants, many with strong ties to US families and communities, whose deportation has been devastating not only for them, but for their families and communities as well.</p>\n<p>Alexis G., who also grew up in the US, told us, “If I were to sing an anthem right now, it would be the Star-Spangled Banner – I don’t know the Mexican anthem.” Lucia H., a farmworker from California, said since her deportation, her 5-year-old son had stopped eating and had to be hospitalized, and her 14-year-old son had suffered a breakdown and was receiving therapy.</p>\n<p>DHS in its release also said it was prioritizing “its resources to enhance public safety and border security.” But a close look at its numbers makes clear that immigration arrests of people with no criminal convictions during the first eight months of the Trump administration nearly tripled compared with approximately the same period in 2016. “Sonia H.” told us: “I’ve never committed a crime, I’ve never been in jail. I didn’t drive because I didn’t have a license.” Her 9-year-old US citizen son now lives in a children’s home run by nuns in Laredo, Texas.</p>\n<p>Even among those with criminal convictions, as Human Right Watch analysis has revealed in previous years, the large majority are not the dangerous, violent criminals highlighted in President Trump’s rhetoric and in ICE news releases.</p>\n<p>Congress and the Trump administration should reform abusive immigration law and policy so that anyone facing deportation gets a fair, individualized hearing in which the person’s ties to US families and communities can be weighed against the government’s interest in deporting them. Those same ties should become the basis for a fair legalization program.</p>\n<p>At the very least, Congress should pass a “clean” DREAM Act with no accompanying harmful trade-offs such as reduced protections for child migrants and refugees, as the White House has indicated it seeks. Congress should also decline any administration requests to increase funding of immigration enforcement efforts that are not tied to long overdue reforms to immigration law as well as efforts to increase transparency and address abusive conditions in immigration detention.</p>\n<p>Without reform and limits to abusive immigration enforcement, many more American families will end up needlessly broken</p>",

The problematic provision was initially introduced in a 2016 law making the regular consultation of websites deemed to contain material glorifying or inciting terrorism an offence – unless those websites were consulted in good faith, for research or professional reasons with the aim of informing the general public. The vague definition of the offence, along with the lack of guidelines about what constituted legitimate research purposes, increased the likelihood of a chilling effect on legitimate forms of expression and sharing information.</p>\n<p>For example, one of France’s leading public research centers, the National Center for Scientific Research (known under its French acronym CNRS), even asked its researchers whose work led them to consult such websites to provide them with their names and coordinates to be able to defend them in case the police launched any investigation. The head of the CNRS’s social science institute noted that the law was, <a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&idArticle=LEGIARTI000032633496\">“dangerous for researchers.”</a></p>\n<p>When the Constitutional Council first deemed the provision unconstitutional in February this year, instead of effectively addressing the court’s reasoning, French lawmakers tried to circumvent the ruling by adding a few words to the provision and adopting it again. Lawyers and French human rights organizations, the Ligue des droits de l’Homme and the Quadrature du Net, challenged the constitutionality of this barely modified provision, and today won, again.</p>\n<p>The court has underlined that merely looking at websites or holding a certain heinous ideology does not justify loss of liberty. Let’s hope that the French legislators take the time now to understand and respect the court’s reasoning.</p>",

It concluded that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was given “virtually no warning” that the ban was to be issued and that neither CBP nor the DHS knew “the answers to basic questions as to the scope of the order.” Even more troubling, the report found that CBP “<a href=\"https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL1N1NR0RC\">violated</a> two separate court orders” in preventing affected travelers from boarding planes bound to the US.</p>\n<p>The former inspector general’s findings are cause for alarm.</p>\n<p>Given all this, Congress should closely monitor the DHS and carefully vet the next nominee for inspector general, when one is put forward. Accountability for DHS has never been more important than it is now, and the next inspector general should be up to the task and willing to speak truth to power. </p>",

His findings, in a civil case for damages, that British forces inflicted inhuman and degrading treatment on detainees, makes for sobering reading.</p>\n<p>One case concerned Abd Ali Hameed Ali Al-Waheed, a computer programmer whom British soldiers took from his home in 2007. The judge found he had been repeatedly beaten by the soldiers, probably with rifle butts, while being taken to a military base. At the base, British forces deliberately deprived him of sleep, and also of sight and hearing by covering up his eyes and ears for long periods and whenever he was taken from his cell to be interrogated. The judge found no justification for these abuses and ordered the Ministry of Defence to pay compensation to him and the other applicants.</p>\n<p>The judge also found that Al-Waheed had been detained unlawfully for weeks, as British forces continued to hold him even after their detention review committee ordered his release. The judge’s ruling stated clearly that none of the Iraqi claimants, including Al-Waheed, had been engaged in terrorist activists or posed any threat to the security of Iraq.</p>\n<p>None of this would be apparent from reading the <em>Daily Mail</em>’s front-page story, which glossed over the fact the judge found that British soldiers abused prisoners and that all the applicants were cleared of any suspicion of terrorism. It quotes a member of parliament, Johnny Mercer, attacking the ruling. Mercer previously successfully campaigned to get the UK government to shut down criminal investigations into war crimes in Iraq.</p>\n<p>It is in the background of such attacks on attempts to investigate allegations of wrongdoing in Iraq, that a British judge has weighed up the evidence and ruled that unlawful abuses took place.</p>\n<p>That isn’t a fiasco. It is justice doing its work.</p>",

The festival featured films and documentaries portraying the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ) people. Police offered no formal legal basis for forcibly shutting down the festival.</p>\n<p>The festival, held for the second year in Kampala, began on December 8. The festival organizer, Kamoga Hassan, told Human Rights Watch that the opening night was successful. A large audience responded positively to the films, he said, which <a href=\"http://www.queerkiff.com/2017-programme/day-one/\" target=\"_blank\">included</a> stories of LGBTIQ people coming to terms with their identities, fighting discrimination, engaging in activism, and falling in love. Organizers had hoped the stories shown during the festival would help to educate Ugandans about communities that face discrimination and marginalization in their country.</p>\n<p>“The raid on the Queer Kampala International Film Festival is just the latest in a series of attacks on freedoms of expression, association and assembly for all Ugandans, including sexual and gender minorities.” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/neela-ghoshal\" target=\"_blank\">Neela Ghoshal,</a> senior researcher on LGBT rights at Human Rights Watch. “Ugandans should be able to watch educational films about LGBT people without having to fear the police.”</p>\n<p>On December 9, shortly before the films began, organizers received a tip-off that police intended to raid the festival and arrest participants if they did not disband. The organizers asked participants to leave. Shortly thereafter, three police officers entered the venue and told organizers that they were shutting down the festival because the films – many of which have received international acclaim – were “pornographic,” Hassan said.</p>\n<p>“I was very surprised that they had to use a narrative that we were screening pornographic films – these were basically documentaries about people’s lived realities,” Hassan said, “Our constitution is clear. We’re not breaking laws.”</p>\n<p>Uganda’s criminal code includes a colonial-era law prohibiting “carnal knowledge against the order of nature” with possible sentences of up to life in prison. The law very rarely leads to prosecutions, but police have used it as a pretext to shut numerous events targeting LGBT audiences and their allies over the past several years, such as the entire 2017 annual Pride Week scheduled events, parades and a fashion show in previous Pride Weeks, and a human rights education workshop in 2012.</p>\n<p>In January 2014, President Yoweri Museveni signed into law the Anti-Homosexuality Act, which criminalized the undefined “promotion” of homosexuality and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/05/14/uganda-anti-homosexuality-acts-heavy-toll\" target=\"_blank\">led to</a> arrests, evictions, firings, and hate crimes against LGBT people. In August 2014, Uganda’s Constitutional Court declared the law null and void.</p>\n<p>Ugandan officials have repeatedly banned events that they falsely claim “promote” homosexuality, Human Rights Watch said. A July 2014 High Court <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/11/uganda-ruling-against-lgbt-activists-violates-rights\" target=\"_blank\">ruling</a>, in violation of free assembly rights, endorsed Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo’s closure in 2012 of a human rights workshop organized by LGBT activists, claiming that workshop participants were “promoting” or “inciting” same-sex acts. Activists have appealed the ruling, but their appeal is yet to be heard.</p>\n<p>In 2016, police <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/05/uganda-police-attack-lgbti-pride-event\" target=\"_blank\">raided</a> a fashion show organized as part of the annual Pride celebrations – beating and humiliating participants, taking pictures of them without consent, and causing one participant to suffer severe injuries from jumping out of a window to escape police violence.</p>\n<p>In August 2017, Lokodo ordered police to shut down all Pride events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/21/no-gay-promotion-can-be-allowed-uganda-cancels-pride-events-lgbt\" target=\"_blank\">stating</a> that “No gay gathering and promotion can be allowed in Uganda,” media reports said.</p>\n<p>“Human rights organizations have for the past few months been conducting human rights training amongst police officers,” said Clare Byarugaba, coordinator of the Equality and Non-discrimination Program at Chapter Four Uganda. “I question the value of these engagements, considering the police service’s continued deliberate suppression and violation of the rights of LGBT Ugandans.”</p>\n<p>Ugandan police routinely violate free expression and assembly rights, particularly of people who criticize the government or who voice divergent views. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous instances in which police used excessive force in recent years, including around recent <a href=\"http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Uganda-age-limit-protests/2558-4145866-hqgfg6z/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">protests against removing a maximum age limit</a> for presidential candidates from Uganda’s laws.</p>\n<p>Hassan said he would try to reschedule the film festival after dialogue with the police.</p>\n<p>“Police leadership should ensure the festival can be rescheduled and go forward free of harassment,” Ghoshal said. “Being LGBT is not a crime, and neither is seeking to better understand discrimination against LGBT people through film.”</p>",

One of the sisters lost a challenge to her deportation in a Turkish court in December 2017 and is at immediate risk of deportation, while the other’s case is still in process.</p>\n<p>The sisters, Ashwaq Hamoud, 30, and Areej Hamoud, 28, said they fled Saudi Arabia in late February to Turkey to escape abuse from male family members, ranging from beatings to being locked in their room and deprived of food. Turkish authorities detained the sisters on May 16, in Istanbul when they attempted to follow up on applications for residency permits.</p>\n<p>“Saudi women fleeing their family or the country can face so-called ‘honor’ violence or other serious harm if returned against their will,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson\">Sarah Leah Whitson</a>, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “If Turkey returns these women, the consequences could be dire.”</p>\n<p>The sisters are at risk of serious harm if returned to their family. They also face possible criminal charges, in violation of their basic rights, including for “parental disobedience,” which can result in punishments ranging from being returned to their guardian’s home to imprisonment, as well as charges of “harming the reputation of the kingdom” due to their public requests for assistance.</p>\n<p>The sisters’ lawyer told Human Rights Watch that he challenged a deportation order for the sisters in May.</p>\n<p>The father of the two sisters informed the Turkish authorities that he believed the two were planning to travel to Syria to join a militant group. The sisters have denied the allegation. There is no known criminal investigation into the women by the Turkish authorities in connection with their father's allegation.</p>\n<p>The lawyer said that he viewed the sisters’ boarding passes, which indicated that the sisters attempted to flee to New Zealand on February 8 via Hong Kong from Abu Dhabi but were not permitted to board their connecting flight in Hong Kong because officials suspected that the purpose of the sisters’ trip was to claim asylum rather than tourism. The sisters instead decided to fly from Hong Kong to Istanbul on February 9 and stay in Turkey rather than return to Saudi Arabia, the lawyer said.</p>\n<p>Following their detention on May 16, the sisters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTalebJawad/status/864448675606671360\">issued</a> a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTalebJawad/status/864460429128544256\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTalebJawad/status/864478921647153152\">videos</a> from their mobile phone in which they claimed they fled family abuse and feared they would be harmed if returned to Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Theirs is the latest in a series of high-profile cases in which Saudi women say they fled abusive families and are at risk of forcible return. In April, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/SaveDinaAli\">Dina Ali Lasloom</a>, a 24-year-old Saudi woman, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/14/fleeing-woman-returned-saudi-arabia-against-her-will\">was returned to Saudi Arabia</a> against her will while in transit in the Philippines. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/28/how-was-saudi-arabia-voted-un-womens-panel\">Mariam al-Otaibi</a>, 29, fled abusive family members in al-Qassim Province for Riyadh in April, only to be captured by authorities and jailed. Authorities released al-Otaibi in late July.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has documented how under <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/16/boxed/women-and-saudi-arabias-male-guardianship-system\" target=\"_blank\">Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship system</a>, adult women must obtain permission from a male guardian to travel abroad, marry, or be released from prison, and may be required to provide guardian consent to work or get health care. These restrictions last from birth until death, as women are, in the view of the Saudi state, permanent legal minors.</p>\n<p>While Saudi Arabia has some regulations on domestic violence, guardianship makes it incredibly difficult for victims of violence to seek protection or obtain legal redress for abuse. The near impossibility of transferring guardianship away from abusive relatives can condemn women to a life of violence. Shelters for survivors of domestic violence often send women back to their abusers if they sign a pledge not to harm them, and women cannot leave such shelters without a male relative to receive them.</p>\n<p>“Saudi women face systematic discrimination every day, and the Hamoud sisters’ case shows that women who flee face the real threat of being returned to abusive families,” Whitson said.</p>",

They described harassment, the threat of gender-based violence, and health risks. Human Rights Watch found that the conditions resulted from insufficient security, poor hygiene and sanitation facilities, and failures in the system to identify and address the needs of vulnerable people.</p>\n<p>“There is no excuse for failing to meet even the most basic standards for protection of women and girls almost two years after the EU-Turkey deal entered into force,” said <a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2FHRW.pr-optout.com%2FTracking.aspx%3FData%3DHHL%253d8.4796-%253eLCE593719%2526SDG%253c90%253a.%26RE%3DMC%26RI%3D3814770%26Preview%3DFalse%26DistributionActionID%3D140700%26Action%3DFollow%2BLink&data=02%7C01%7Ccossee%40hrw.org%7C1cce905ed3ab4eb6dc5f08d50ba5a6ab%7C2eb79de4d8044273a6e64b3188855f66%7C0%7C0%7C636427728455801413&sdata=Qcb3wCMR56yyRDaDHpRwJ%2B59icch%2BWCQWx2B47p3%2FzA%3D&reserved=0\">Hillary Margolis</a>, women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The risks to women’s health and safety in Moria are dire, and as winter arrives, they will only get worse.”</p>\n<p>\n<div>\n<article data-eq-pts=\"large: 728\">\n<span></span>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/opentheislands\">\n<img width=\"832\" alt=\"End The Asylum Crisis on Greek Islands\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16x9/public/multimedia_images_2017/201711europe_greece_asylumseekers6.jpg?itok=94q3ptkw\" height=\"468\">\n</a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<h2> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/opentheislands\">\nEnd The Asylum Crisis on Greek Islands </a>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Tell Greece’s Prime Minister to end the containment of asylum seekers on the Islands by December 21, and call on other European leaders to support Greece in doing so!</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/opentheislands\">Act Now</a> </div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\nThousands of women and girls are trapped on Greek islands, often in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/23/greece-asylum-seekers-abysmal-conditions-islands\">horrendous conditions</a>, due to a “containment” policy for asylum seekers, to facilitate speedy processing and return to Turkey under <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/14/qa-why-eu-turkey-migration-deal-no-blueprint\">the EU-Turkey deal.</a> “Hotspots” were established on several Greek islands to receive, identify, and process asylum seekers and migrants. Human Rights Watch has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/19/greece-refugee-hotspots-unsafe-unsanitary\">previously documented</a> violence, insecurity, and unhygienic and unsanitary conditions in the hotspots. As of December 13, the population in Moria, which has a capacity of 2,330, was 6,238.\n<p>The women and girls interviewed described pervasive sexual harassment and a persistent sense of insecurity in Moria, and said authorities are unresponsive to their complaints and do not take adequate action to ensure their safety. One woman said she had been approached by a fellow asylum seeker asking for sex in exchange for money. Many said they do not feel safe moving around Moria alone and leave their shelters only in groups or accompanied by male relatives. A 17-year-old girl from Syria said: “Out of fear, I stay in the tent. I don’t go out.”</p>\n<p>A 13-year-old girl from Syria who lives in a section of Moria reserved for women and girls travelling alone, said that male asylum-seekers call to women and girls using insulting and sexual terms. “The guys [living here], it’s like they’ve never seen a girl before,” she said.</p>\n<p>She said another girl asylum seeker approached her about marrying the girl’s brother. “I was really scared,” she said. “I told her to go away. She left, but she looked at me with a lot of anger. I’ve seen her brother standing at the door [to the section], looking at us. I’m really afraid to go out.”</p>\n<p>Frequent fights among asylum seekers – often among intoxicated men – leave women and girls feeling unsafe, and they said that authorities do nothing in response. “Even if there is fighting, the police just stand there watching while the men are bleeding,” said a 31-year-old Syrian woman. “It is impossible to go out by yourself because of the drinking [and] the fighting.”  </p>\n<p>These findings echo what dozens of other female asylum seekers and representatives of agencies that provide aid to migrants told Human Rights Watch about conditions in the Greek hotspots, citing harassment, the threat of gender-based violence, and health risks, during earlier visits in 2016 and 2017.</p>\n<p>Concerns about safety and inadequate facilities hinder women and girls’ access to toilets and showers. Female asylum seekers said that toilets and showers in Moria are not secure or private, and that they fear going alone. “We tell someone to come with us or we don’t wash ourselves,” said a 15-year-old girl from Syria.</p>\n<p>Women and girls also said the toilets are unsanitary and unhygienic, with feces in some showers and toilets, and a lack of running water, forcing them to venture further from their tents to use alternate bathrooms. Human Rights Watch researchers have visited a number of toilets and showers in Moria and have confirmed these conditions. Some who live in tents in the section designated for unaccompanied women and girls said that other asylum seekers living in the containers, which house the section’s toilets, refuse them access.</p>\n<p>Those interviewed also said that sanitation and hygiene are especially difficult during their periods, and that camp authorities provide few supplies such as sanitary pads.</p>\n<p>In some cases, officials had failed to identify vulnerable women and girls, as Greek laws require, and to refer them to appropriate support services and accommodation. They include pregnant women and women who have recently given birth, survivors of sexual and other serious physical or psychological violence, trafficking victims, and people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Such vulnerable people are also entitled to exemption from the accelerated asylum border procedures and returns to Turkey under the EU-Turkey deal, and to be given priority for transfer to the mainland, where more services are available. Human Rights Watch has previously documented indirect pressure from the EU on aid agencies and Greek authorities to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/01/eu/greece-pressure-minimize-numbers-migrants-identified-vulnera\">minimize the number of people categorized as vulnerable</a> and eligible for priority treatment.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed women who clearly meet the vulnerability criteria but had not been given that status, including two who were nine months pregnant and sleeping on the ground in tents, and four who had informed authorities that they are survivors of rape, trafficking, or other gender-based violence.</p>\n<p>Greek authorities, with EU support, should promptly investigate reports of harassment and violence in Moria and take urgent action to ensure that asylum-seeking women and girls can move freely around the hotspot and safely and securely access all of its facilities. There should be separate, secure shelter for women and girls traveling alone, and separate, secure, accessible, and hygienic toilets and bathing facilities that ensure privacy for men and women. Authorities should provide adequate lighting and identify and monitor high-risk areas. The EU and the Greek government should work together to identify asylum seekers in hotspots who meet “vulnerability” critera and facilitate their access to appropriate shelter, services, and asylum processes.</p>\n<p>The recent announcement by Greece that 5,000 asylum seekers will be moved from the islands to the mainland by December 15 as an emergency decongestion measure is a positive development, Human Rights Watch said. A total of 2,000 people had been transferred from early December through December 13. But this measure is not sufficient to alleviate the overcrowding or address the systemic issues linked to the containment policy that have created this emergency situation.The Greek government should end the containment policy on the islands, including for women and girls, and, with the support of the EU and the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR, transfer asylum seekers to the mainland, and provide adequate accommodation.</p>\n<p>Greek authorities are aware of overcrowding, poor hygiene and sanitation, and protection risks in Moria but have not acted to rectify the problems, both officials and aid workers interviewed at Moria told Human Rights Watch.</p>\n<p>Greece should also ratify the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/istanbul-convention\">Istanbul Convention</a>, a Council of Europe treaty on prevention of and response to violence against women, which guarantees protections and services for all women and girls regardless of residency status. Greece signed the Convention in May 2011 but has yet to ratify it.</p>\n<p>“Asylum seekers fleeing war or abuse shouldn’t have to hide in their tents to feel safe in Europe,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/eva-cosse\">Eva Cossé</a>, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Greek and EU authorities have a responsibility to put a stop to conditions that increase the risk of violence and harassment, and that deny women and girls privacy and dignity.”</p>\n<p><strong>Accounts of Women and Girls in Moria</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Insecurity, Harassment</strong></p>\n<p>Nearly all of the 25 women and girls interviewed said that sexual harassment by male asylum seekers prevents them from moving freely around Moria. “Someone stopped me and asked me to have sex with him and he said he would pay me,” said Yusra, 31, from Yemen, whose name, as with others interviewed, was changed for her protection. “You hear this kind of thing every day: ‘Big ass,’ ‘Let me kiss you,’ ‘Come with me.’”</p>\n<p>Nabila, 19, from Afghanistan, said that men also intimidate women by insulting them for not wearing a veil: “If a girl is walking alone, if she is not wearing a headscarf, they will say, ‘In just a few days here you have changed. What has happened to you?’ ”</p>\n<p>Cynthia, 18<strong>,</strong> fled Cameroon – where homosexuality is illegal – because of persecution due to her sexual orientation. She said that fellow asylum seekers in Moria regularly harass and abuse her because of her sexual orientation and because she does not wear feminine clothing. She said that one male asylum seeker from Afghanistan threatened and assaulted her repeatedly: “He once pushed me against a tree by the throat. He said, ‘Don’t talk to Afghan women.’ I haven’t reported it. I’m afraid…. If I report it to the police, maybe they won’t do anything, [but] if he is reprimanded, his friends will come and hurt me.”</p>\n<p>Women and girls said that when they reported harassment or protection concerns authorities in the hotspot did not address them. Several asylum seekers in the section for women and girls said that unaccompanied boys in an adjoining section or other males in the camp scale the fence between sections, and that they regularly come in and around the section at night, often drinking or using drugs. The women and girls’ section does not have its own designated guard.</p>\n<p>Amal, 47, from Syria, said she reported the behavior to camp management, but to no avail. “I said we need someone to protect us in our section,” she said. “You told us when we arrived, ‘You are in a safe place here.’… But it is not a safe place. They didn’t respond – they did nothing.”</p>\n<p>Yusra, 31, from Yemen, said that despite security at the entrance to Moria’s grounds, once inside the hotspot, there is little protection: “In your section, no one can save you. You are dealing with men, with drunks, with everything.” Yusra said she complained to police about an area near her section where people regularly do drugs, drink alcohol, and fight, but the police did nothing.</p>\n<p>Wahida, 15, from Afghanistan, described a lawless atmosphere: “There are places to go report things, but they don’t care. That’s why mostly people solve this kind of problem themselves and there are fights.”</p>\n<p>Women also said that inconsistent electricity sometimes leaves parts of the hotspot in darkness, creating additional fear and risk, especially at night. Sadia, 36, from Afghanistan, lives in Moria with her son and three daughters, ages 9 to 15. “We don’t go out alone,” she said. “If it’s possible, we don’t go outside at night. If you have to, you wake up another woman [to go with you].” Fatima, 31, from Syria, said her 11-year-old daughter fell on an unlit path one night and scraped her leg badly. Both women said they had requested flashlights from the management but had not received them.</p>\n<p><strong>Vulnerable Women and Girls</strong></p>\n<p>Under Greek law, pregnant women, new mothers, and survivors of sexual and gender based violence and trafficking are among those categorized as vulnerable and requiring access to special protection.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has previously <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/18/greece-refugees-disabilities-overlooked-underserved\">documented</a> the failure of Greek authorities and supporting partners to identify vulnerable people, and the lack of access to urgently-needed mental health care and psychosocial support for all asylum seekers on the Greek islands.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed women at Moria who clearly meet the vulnerability criteria but had not been classified as such by Greek authorities, including four survivors of rape, trafficking, and other gender-based violence.</p>\n<p>Farah, 42, said she fled Iran when her family threatened her for marrying someone from a different ethnic group, and that a smuggler raped her en route to Greece. She said she disclosed her experience, including the rape, to a government psychologist when she arrived on Lesbos, but the psychologist did not categorize her as vulnerable. She attempted suicide at Moria by swallowing prescription medications but was not relocated or provided psychological care.</p>\n<p>“When I went to the psychologist and explained that I had tried twice to kill myself, she just passed over it like it was nothing,” Farah said. When she sought additional help, “[The doctor] said I need to see a psychologist. I went to the psychologist. She said I need to make an appointment. They gave me an appointment for January [2018]. I told them that’s too late, but they said that you have to pay money to go sooner.”</p>\n<p>Cynthia, 18, who fled Cameroon because of persecution based on her sexual orientation, said she has experienced ongoing harassment in Moria since arriving in June because she identifies as a lesbian and wears clothing that does not conform to gender norms. She said that she disclosed full details of the harassment at Moria, as well as her previous experiences of persecution based on her sexual orientation, during her asylum interview in July. She also said she had sought help from a social assistant at Moria, telling the person about the recurrent harassment and threats and that she needed to be transferred elsewhere. As of mid-November, she remained at Moria.</p>\n<p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed three pregnant women in Moria, and one who was pregnant upon arrival but suffered a miscarriage soon after. Two women who were nine months pregnant were sleeping on the ground in tents.</p>\n<p>“It is very difficult to sleep comfortably,” said Qasima, 20, from Afghanistan. Her previous pregnancy ended in a stillbirth. “I really need to move. I told [officials], but they didn’t say anything specific. They just said I’m on the list [for transfer to another site].” She also said that accessing the hotspot’s toilets and other facilities is a problem: “It is difficult to walk because there are no real paths. I am afraid I will fall.”</p>\n<p>Rasha, 19, from Syria and also nine months pregnant, said: “Going to the toilet is very difficult, because my belly is big, and it is very cold.” Rasha said that she had been living in a tent with her husband and 8-year-old brother for a month, and that no one had discussed moving her to other accommodation. The family uses one of their three allotted blankets to cover the ground, and shares the other two for warmth.</p>\n<p>With winter approaching, Rasha said, she was suffering from the cold: “We went [three times] to the place to get blankets and said I was pregnant, but they didn’t give us more.” <a href=\"http://www.spherehandbook.org/\">International humanitarian standards</a> call for vulnerable people, including pregnant and lactating women, to receive additional bedding and clothing in line with their needs.</p>\n<p>Neither woman had received comprehensive pre-natal medical care or had information about whom to contact when she went into labor or where she could deliver her baby. “I don’t know if they will even take me to the hospital to give birth,” Qasima said. “Most of the time I just cry because I don’t know what will happen” There have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanWillemHam/status/922155558198808576\">reports</a> of women giving birth in their tents at hotspots on other islands due to lack of available medical care.</p>\n<p>A third woman, who was five months pregnant and whose five previous pregnancies ended in miscarriages, said that doctors at a Lesbos hospital told her she needed specialized medical care in Athens for her high-risk pregnancy. She continued to live in a tent in Moria for one month, and though she had been transferred to a site with better conditions on Lesbos, she had still not been relocated to Athens or seen medical specialists.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor Hygiene, Sanitation      </strong></p>\n<p>All of the women and girls interviewed said that they did not feel safe using toilets and showers in Moria, and that the facilities are unsanitary, unhygienic, and insecure. Mariam, 21, from Syria, said that because of the distance to other toilets, men and women living in her area were sharing one toilet without a secure door. “The door is only tied with a rope,” she said. “The lock is broken.” <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/protection/women/3f696bcc4/sexual-gender-based-violence-against-refugees-returnees-internally-displaced.htm\">Guidelines</a> on prevention of gender-based violence in displacement settings from the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) call for gender-separated toilets and bathing facilities with working locks, adequate lighting, and privacy.</p>\n<p>Wahida, 15, from Afghanistan said that the toilet near the tent she shared with her mother, four sisters, and one brother was too dirty to use, but that other toilets are difficult to access. “There was a toilet closer to our tents, but it is so dirty – inside, it is full of shit everywhere,” she said. “The other one is better, but it is far away. It is 50 meters uphill and my mother has a knee problem, so it is too difficult for her.” Other women said that not all the toilets in the site have running water, forcing them to use toilets far from their shelters and making the functioning toilets overcrowded.</p>\n<p>The lack of toilets for overcrowded shelters leads to open defecation in non-toilet facilities. Wahida said the tent she lives in with her family was meant for 10 people but houses 17. She and other women and girls said that people defecate in the showers, and there is increased risk of exposure to human feces, especially for females, due to lack of privacy in the shelters. Wahida said that the only place to change clothes in private is in the dirty showers: “It is horrible because, in the shower, you go normally to clean yourself, but [in Moria] you worry about getting dirty because inside, people use it as a toilet.”</p>\n<p>Some women said that, because they share living space with other families, they are unable to remove their <em>hijab</em>, or headscarf, as they normally would at home. They said that the difficulty of bathing and changing and washing clothing, caused skin conditions and gynecological infections. They described symptoms including skin irritation, itching, and burning during urination.</p>\n<p><strong>Menstrual Hygiene </strong></p>\n<p>Some women and girls said there had previously been distributions of sanitary pads, but that these ceased around September. Others said they were given sanitary pads only once or twice after arriving on Lesbos. Wahida, 15, from Afghanistan, said that having her period is very difficult due to the lack of clean and easily accessible toilets with running water, and a dearth of supplies. “When we first arrived, they gave us a bag with some women’s stuff inside,” she said. “But it finished quickly, and you don’t know if you can ask for more.”</p>\n<p>Women and girls said that since the distribution of sanitary pads stopped, they have to use their cash allowance to buy the products or rely on distributions at volunteer-run centers. Djamila, 13, from Syria, said she had not yet received cash assistance and had to ask other asylum seekers for sanitary pads. “I have to go to another girl to ask for one or two to manage [my period],” she said. “It’s like [the people distributing them] make fun of us because we go back and ask [for more] and they don’t give it to us.”</p>\n<p>Some women said that poor sanitation in Moria exacerbates the difficulty of managing their periods and maintaining hygiene. They said that, during their periods, they carry water to their shelters every day to wash their clothing, and use the toilets even if they are not clean or easily accessible. “It is very difficult because the bathroom is far from here, and I have three kids, and I also have to carry water,” said Yara, 21, from Syria.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Obligations; International Standards</strong></p>\n<p>Under Greek law, nine categories of people, including pregnant women, unaccompanied children, victims of torture, survivors of sexual or gender-based violence, and people with disabilities are considered vulnerable or at-risk. The law grants them special protection, including access to services, and exempts them from the accelerated admissibility process under the EU-Turkey deal. They are entitled to priority in the regular Greek asylum system and, transfer to the mainland, where they could more easily access services.</p>\n<p>The Greek Reception and Identification Service, staffed by government doctors, psychologists and social workers, is responsible for identifying and registering people in vulnerable groups upon their arrival. The European Asylum Support Office supports the Greek Asylum Service in conducting vulnerability assessments.</p>\n<p>The Sphere project, which sets international standards for hunaitarian assistance, calls for safe and equal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities for everyone in the affected population, including private, secure toilets and bathing areas for women. The standards also call for provision of “appropriate materials for menstrual hygiene” to all women and girls of menstruating age, as well as means to discreetly launder or dispose of menstrual hygiene materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gbvguidelines.org/en/home/\">International guidelines</a> on prevention of and response to gender-based violence in emergencies call for mitigating the risk of gender-based violence from the earliest stages of crisis response, including by providing sufficient lighting in all communal spaces; separate, private, and secure toilets and bathing facilities for men and women; and separate, secure accommodation for unaccompanied women and children. Authorities should also ensure appropriate mechanisms for reporting violence and harassment; promptly investigate and respond to complaints; and identify and monitor areas in displacement sites where there is high risk of gender-based violence and take needed security measures.</p>\n<p>Under the <a href=\"http://iawg.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chapter5.pdf\">Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for reproductive health in emergencies</a>, displaced populations and relevant service providers should have information about how to access health services that can manage both normal and complicated pregnancy and delivery. Women in late-stage pregnancy should receive clean-delivery kits for home births if delivery in a clinic or hospital setting is not available. Referral systems for emergency obstetric care should be established in the initial stages of an emergency, and pregnant women and health providers should know how to get such care.</p>\n<p><strong>Response from Authorities</strong></p>\n<p>Greek authorities are aware of overcrowding, poor hygiene and sanitation, and protection risks in Moria but have not acted to rectify the problems. In a meeting with Human Rights Watch in late September, 2017, an official responsible for managing Moria acknowledged that the hotspot is well over capacity and said he had asked the central authorities repeatedly to transfer asylum seekers to the mainland before the onset of winter, but in vain.</p>\n<p>Also in early October, Human Rights Watch researchers testified before Greek parliament about the conditions in Moria, including problems for people with disabilities. In response, the parliamentary committee on October 4 adopted a resolution to make an official visit and investigate the situation. As of December 15, the visit had not taken place, nor had a date been announced.</p>\n<p>International aid organizations, including UNHCR, have <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.gr/nea/artikel/4a76b11e8b1ebfa14c535d6ccb00143b/unhcr-calls-for-accelerated-winter-p.html\">repeatedly denounced</a> the unsanitary, unhygienic, and unsafe conditions in Moria.</p>\n<p>One humanitarian aid worker who had worked with two different organizations inside Moria said that she left her job in September due to the inhumane conditions she witnessed and the lack of response when authorities were informed of instances of attempted suicide, self-harm, sexual exploitation, and physical assault inside the hotspot. “I tried my best to report it,” she said, referring to efforts to tell police about abuse occurring inside Moria. “Nothing has changed.”</p>",

Four years into the conflict, both parties continue to commit grave human rights crimes against civilians.</p>\n<p>Despite the August 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS), which envisioned the hybrid court, abuses by all parties persist as the conflict continues to spread. South Sudan’s transitional government has neither ended violations by its army nor made progress toward setting up the court. The lack of progress points to the need for measures like targeted sanctions against officials responsible and an arms embargo, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>“The government has consistently let deadlines slip while its forces commit crimes with impunity” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/mausi-segun\">Mausi Segun</a>, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The people of South Sudan deserve justice, not a chain of broken promises, and so the international community should impose consequences.”</p>\n<p>In September 2017, the AU Peace and Security Council issued a communiqué on South Sudan, warning that it would consider necessary steps, including sanctions, should the South Sudanese parties continue to delay implementing the peace agreement in full. The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, during a visit to South Sudan in October, similarly warned of sanctions if the government did not live up to its pledges.</p>\n<p>South Sudan’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/08/07/south-sudans-new-war/abuses-government-and-opposition-forces\">civil war</a> began on December 15, 2013, when troops loyal to president Salva Kiir – a Dinka – clashed with those of then-Vice-President Riek Machar – a Nuer – in the capital, Juba. Within hours, mainly Dinka government troops carried out large-scale targeted killings, detentions, and torture of mainly Nuer civilians in various parts of Juba, while thousands of Nuer soldiers defected to an opposition army. In the following months, fighting spread to Bor, Bentiu, Malakal, and across the Greater Upper Nile region. As towns changed hands, soldiers on both sides killed thousands of civilians, often based on their ethnicity, and destroyed and pillaged civilian property.</p>\n<p>In late 2015, conflict spread to the Equatorias, as new rebel groups claiming an affiliation formed, and government forces carried out deadly counterinsurgency campaigns in previously stable regions <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/06/south-sudan-army-abuses-spread-west\">south</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/14/south-sudan-new-spate-ethnic-killings\">west</a> of the capital. Government soldiers and allied fighters have attacked civilians sheltering inside the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/04/dispatches-un-should-investigate-south-sudan-attack\">UN bases in Malakal</a> and Juba, in blatant violation of international law. In July 2016, government and opposition forces <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/15/south-sudan-killings-rapes-looting-juba\">fought in Juba</a> and government forces attacked, killed, and raped civilians, including displaced people and foreign aid workers. Since the Juba crisis, government forces have continued to fight rebels in Central and Western Equatoria, Unity, and northern Jonglei.</p>\n<p>The impact of the violence and abuses is devastating. More than <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/20171213_SS_Humanitarian_Snapshot_November_final.pdf\">4 million people have fled their homes, with more than 2 million now refugees</a> in neighboring countries. In February, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/11/starving-under-bullets-south-sudan\">UN declared a famine </a>in parts of Unity state, and almost half the country’s population faces acute food shortages.</p>\n<p>In October 2015, the AU released the <a href=\"http://www.peaceau.org/uploads/auciss.final.report.pdf\">final report</a> of the Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan (AUCoISS), which found that the warring parties had committed grave human rights abuses and war crimes. The commission’s findings were largely consistent with Human Rights Watch reporting, and proposed creating an AU-led process to bring those with the greatest responsibility for the atrocities to account.</p>\n<div data-type=\"image\">\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/262170\">\n<img alt=\"2015_AFR_SouthSudan_AU\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/media/images/photographs/2015_AFR_SouthSudan_AU.jpg?itok=7ilOBa4l 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/media/images/photographs/2015_AFR_SouthSudan_AU.jpg?itok=LGylLzMb 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/media/images/photographs/2015_AFR_SouthSudan_AU.jpg?itok=7aZl7Hir 658w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/media/images/photographs/2015_AFR_SouthSudan_AU.jpg?itok=WoLzGKz6\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/262170\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p>South Sudan's President Salva Kiir (bottom L) and South Sudan's rebel commander Riek Machar (bottom R), together with African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Smail Chergui (top L), Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta (top C) and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, attend the signing a ceasefire agreement during the Inter Governmental Authority on Development Summit on the case of South Sudan in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, Feburary 1, 2015. </p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2015 Reuters</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>The August 2015 agreement included a hybrid court to be established by the AU Commission to investigate and try those responsible for grave abuses since 2013. Under the agreement, the court is to consist of South Sudanese and other African judges and staff. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/12/10/ending-era-injustice/advancing-prosecutions-serious-crimes-committed-south-sudans\">findings on significant weaknesses in the national justice system</a> support the need for the court.</p>\n<p>More than two years later, the court has yet to be created.</p>\n<p>In early 2017, the AU held consultations with the South Sudanese Justice Ministry that led to a draft statute for the court and a memorandum of understanding between the AU and the South Sudanese government on the establishment of the court. Both documents were submitted to the South Sudan council of ministers in August, but the government has taken no further action.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20170922/communiqu%C3%A9-720th-meeting-psc-ministerial-level-situation-south-sudan\">September communiqué</a>, the AU Peace and Security Council said the South Sudanese government should expedite creating the court and completing its part of the agreement, or face “necessary steps, including sanction measures, that could ensure effective and efficient implementation” of the agreement.</p>\n<p>In December, government officials told Human Rights Watch researchers in Juba that a number of key ministers oppose the court, including the communications minister, Michael Makuei – against whom the US brought sanctions in September for undermining the peace process; the cabinet affairs minister, Martin Elia Lomuro; and the defense minister, Kuol Manyang.</p>\n<p>Under the August 2015 agreement, the AU Commission has the authority to establish the court with or without the engagement of the South Sudanese government. If the transitional government continues to ignore its responsibilities under Chapter V of the peace agreement, the AU should proceed with the court on its own, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>If a credible, fair, and independent hybrid court does not progress, the option of the International Criminal Court (ICC) remains and should be pursued, Human Rights Watch said. As South Sudan is not a party to the ICC, the UN Security Council would need to refer the situation to the court in the absence of a request from the government of South Sudan.</p>\n<p>“The AU should ensure progress on the hybrid court, if necessary without cooperation from South Sudan’s leaders, or consider coercive measures like targeted sanctions against anyone responsible for obstruction,” Segun said. “If the leaders won’t stand by the victims of atrocities, the African Union should step up and show it won’t abandon this precedent-setting plan for accountability in one of the continent’s worst human rights crises.”</p>\n<div><strong>Documented Violations, Abuses Since the Peace Agreement</strong></div>\n<div>Since the 2015 peace deal was signed, Human Rights Watch has documented scores of cases of arbitrary arrests and detention, beatings, and torture, as well as numerous cases of enforced disappearance and extrajudicial killings, mostly by government forces in the context of counterinsurgency operations, but also crimes by opposition forces. Both sides also continued to forcefully recruit children to train and fight, despite pledges to stop. Army commanders overseeing abusive operations have not been investigated.</div>\n<p>In March 2016, Human Rights Watch documented that government forces carried out <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/06/south-sudan-army-abuses-spread-west\">killings, enforced disappearances, rapes, and other grave abuses</a> against civilians belonging to Equatorian ethnic groups in the Western Equatoria region. Among those killed was a 34-year-old man arrested by soldiers in the Napere neighborhood of Yambio in November and detained for two months. His brother said he found the body weeks later: “He was tied and his face was rotten. All of his body was rotten. But I recognized him from his clothes, feet, and fingers.” The army commander of Yambio at the time, Col. Makeny Makor Buoy, was neither investigated nor tried. He was rotated to his home region of Lakes.</p>\n<p>In Wau, in April 2016, researchers discovered that government soldiers had carried out a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/24/south-sudan-civilians-killed-tortured-western-region\">wide range of often-deadly attacks on civilians</a> in and around the town, killing, torturing, raping, and detaining and disappearing civilians on the basis of their ethnicity, in addition to looting and burning down homes. A 55-year-old woman said that soldiers came to her village outside of Wau in March and shot her 60-year-old husband in the stomach and her 29-year-old son in the neck: “We were at home and then we heard shooting and we hit the ground and crawled away when a group of soldiers came in. There was no reason for them to target us.” The army commander of Wau at the time, Maj. Gen. Attayib “Taitai” Gatluak, was not investigated for his role in the crimes committed by his forces there, and has faced no charges for his participation in, or command responsibility for, any crimes.</p>\n<p>Government soldiers killed at least 73 civilians, raped dozens of women, and extensively looted civilian property, including humanitarian goods, during and after clashes between government and opposition forces in Juba in July 2016. In many cases, government forces appeared to target non-Dinka civilians. A 35-year-old man said that two army picks-ups surrounded the hotel where he hid with 27 other Nuer men shortly before a ceasefire ended the fighting on July 11. A soldier knocked at the door and asked if any Nuer were staying there. “We urged the guard not to open. They asked, ‘Why are you hiding Nuer!’ and then they started to shoot with their heavy machine guns through the doors and wall. That’s how my friend Mading Chan was killed.”</p>\n<p>The same day, a large number of soldiers <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/15/south-sudan-killings-rapes-looting-juba\">overran the Terrain compound that housed a number of international organizations</a>, executed a Nuer journalist, raped and gang-raped several women, and assaulted dozens of staff. International pressure led the government to establish an ad hoc tribunal to try armed personnel responsible for the attack, but no credible investigation was carried out to determine the responsibility for the scores of South Sudanese women raped, or civilians killed during and after the fighting officially ended in Juba on July 11.</p>\n<p>The army chief of staff at the time, Paul Malong Awan, was replaced in April 2017, and has yet to be subject to criminal investigation to determine his responsibility for crimes committed while he was in command. He has since left South Sudan for Kenya.</p>\n<p>In October 2016, researchers found that government and opposition forces had <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/22/south-sudan-new-abuse-civilians-both-sides\">committed serious abuses in Yei</a>, including killings, rapes, and arbitrary arrests by the army, and abductions by the rebels. On October 8, rebels ambushed a convoy of civilians leaving Yei and shot indiscriminately at a truck, then set it on fire. An 11-year-old boy who survived the attack said: “They started to shoot and I lay down [in the truck]. Others fell on top of me. One had been shot to the head.”</p>\n<p>In mid-November 2016, an international journalist found seven charred bodies in a mud house in the outskirts of Yei, in a government-controlled area. Witnesses quoted by the Associated Press said the deceased were civilians who had been abducted and killed by men wearing uniforms. More than a dozen former detainees, released at the time of the Human Rights Watch visit, said they had been held by government forces in overcrowded cells in Yei with little food and water and routinely beaten and tortured.</p>\n<p>In refugee camps in northern Uganda in May 2017, researchers heard from South Sudanese refugees that government forces <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/08/01/soldiers-assume-we-are-rebels/escalating-violence-and-abuses-south-sudans\">indiscriminately fired into civilian settlements</a> in the Equatoria region during counterinsurgency operations, killing many civilians. The attacks forced over a million South Sudanese to abandon their homes and livelihoods and flee across the border.</p>\n<p>A woman from Kajo Keji county said that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/01/caught-south-sudans-war\">soldiers killed her husband and her two children</a>, ages 5 and 10, while she was cooking dinner at home in January 2017: “About 10 soldiers came to our house. My son told me they had come, and my husband went out. They shot him. Then my other son followed him and they shot both boys. One soldier ran after me and severely twisted my arm. I managed to get away. And I just ran. With one arm, how do I care for my other children and my mother? I want to commit suicide.” </p>",

Shortly afterward, an unidentified motorcyclist stopped at the police post and drove off with Sombath’s jeep, leaving his own motorcycle by the roadside. A few minutes later, a truck with flashing lights stopped at the police post. Two people got out of the truck, took Sombath into the vehicle, then drove off. The authorities later denied any knowledge of Sombath being taken into custody. He has not been seen since.\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nFive years on, Sombath’s ‘disappearance’ highlights the glaring problems of enforced disappearance, widespread rights violations, and the culture of impunity protecting government officials in Laos. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Phil Robertson</h4>\n<p>Deputy Asia Director</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>At a news conference in Bangkok on December 7, 2017, Shui-Meng Ng, Sombath’s wife, publicly revealed that people she declined to name had seen Sombath at a police holding facility in Vientiane on the night of December 15, a number of hours after he was publicly seen at the police checkpoint. She said that his jeep was seen at the parking lot of that facility on the same evening.</p>\n<p>This newly public information demonstrates the inadequacy of the official investigations into Sombath’s disappearance and the contours of a cover-up by Lao authorities. The authorities have repeatedly dismissed concerns raised by Sombath’s family, foreign governments, and human rights groups about whether the government investigation was serious.</p>\n<p>Shui-Meng Ng told Human Rights Watch:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Five years on, we are sadly no closer to finding Sombath than we were in the week after he was taken from us. The only thing that has progressed over that time is the Lao government’s cover-up, and the wall of denial and delays it has constructed to buy time. While disheartened, the friends of Sombath all around the world will never give up demanding answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Laos has signed, but not ratified, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED). Enforced disappearances are defined under international law as the arrest or detention of a person by state officials or their agents followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty, or to reveal the person’s fate or whereabouts. Enforced disappearances violate a range of fundamental human rights protected under international law, including prohibitions against arbitrary arrest and detention; torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; and extrajudicial execution. Disappearances are a continuing offense that cause anguish and suffering for the victim’s family members.</p>\n<p>“Sombath’s ‘disappearance’ will be a stain on the Lao government’s reputation until his fate is explained and those responsible are fairly prosecuted and punished,” Robertson said. “Donor governments, UN agencies, and multilateral organizations should keep raising concerns with Lao leaders until there are credible answers about Sombath’s fate.”</p>",

The action is especially significant because Sri Lanka used antipersonnel mines in the past and has since undertaken an extensive, ongoing mine clearance effort.</p>\n<p>“Sri Lanka’s accession should spur other nations that haven’t joined the landmine treaty to take another look at why they want to be associated with such an obsolete, abhorrent weapon,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/stephen-goose\">Steve Goose</a>, arms director at Human Rights Watch and chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines – the group effort behind the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. “This should spur other countries that haven’t joined the treaty to review their position and address any obstacles to joining it.”</p>\n<p>Sri Lanka deposited its instrument of accession to the treaty with the United Nations in New York, becoming the 163rd country to join. The Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively bans antipersonnel landmines, and requires destruction of stockpiles, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims of the weapons.</p>\n<p>Sri Lanka participated as an observer in the fast-track diplomatic Ottawa Process, which led to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in September 1997, but said <a href=\"http://archives.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?act=submit&pqs_year=1999&pqs_type=lm&pqs_report=sri_lanka&pqs_section=\">it could not sign</a> due to its ongoing conflict with the secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Since then it has expressed its support for the humanitarian objectives of the Mine Ban Treaty and voted in favor of every annual UN General Assembly resolution on it. In December 2015, Sri Lanka announced that it was “<a href=\"http://www.apminebanconvention.org/fileadmin/APMBC/MSP/14MSP/day2/02a-UNIVERSALIZATION-Sri-Lanka.pdf\">seriously considering</a>” joining the Mine Ban Treaty “as a matter of priority” following “a paradigm shift” in policy after the election of a new government in January 2015.</p>\n<p>Sri Lanka reports that it has <a href=\"http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/DFEDEDA19D435667C12572D1002B9205/$file/Sri+Lanka+2004.pdf\">never produced or exported antipersonnel mines</a>. Under the treaty, its stockpiled landmines must be destroyed within the next four years. The Sri Lanka army has acknowledged using antipersonnel mines in the past, while the LTTE produced and used them extensively during the armed conflict, which ended in May 2009.</p>\n<p>After Sri Lanka’s accession, three South Asian countries have yet to join the Mine Ban Treaty: <a href=\"http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2017/india\">India</a>, <a href=\"http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2017/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2017/nepal\">Nepal</a>.</p>\n<p>Austria will host and preside over the <a href=\"http://www.icbl.org/en-gb/the-treaty/treaty-meetings/meetings-of-states-parties/16msp.aspx\">16th meeting of the states parties</a> to the treaty in Vienna during the week of December 18-21, 2017.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), chairs the US Campaign to Ban Landmines, and serves as ban policy editor for Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor. The ICBL received the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1997/press.html\">1997 Nobel Peace Prize</a>, together with its coordinator, Jody Williams, for its efforts to bring about the Mine Ban Treaty and for its contributions to a new international diplomacy based on humanitarian imperatives.</p>\n<p>“After deliberating for almost two decades, Sri Lanka ultimately decided to get on the right side of history by relinquishing antipersonnel mines,” Goose said. “With every country that joins the treaty, the norm against these weapons only gets stronger.&quot;</p>",

The Kenyan government should urgently take steps to protect women and girls, as well as men and boys, from sexual violence.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The 31-page report, “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/node/312377\">‘They Were Men in Uniform’: Sexual Violence against Women and Girls in Kenya’s 2017 Elections</a>,” documents the devastating physical, mental, social, and economic impact of gender-based violence and serious human rights abuses surrounding the recent elections. Human Rights Watch found that the government failed to prevent election-related sexual violence, properly investigate cases, hold attackers accountable, and ensure that survivors have access to comprehensive, quality, and timely post-rape care. Many attacks were by security forces, survivors said.</div>\n<p>“The impact of sexual violence on survivors is devastating,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/agnes-odhiambo\">Agnes Odhiambo</a>, senior women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Almost all women and girls we spoke to suffered physical harm and profound mental trauma and feared that their attackers may never be held accountable.”</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 68 females, three male survivors of sexual violence, and 12 witnesses in Mathare, Dandora, and Kibera in Nairobi, and in Kisumu and Bungoma in western Kenya. Human Rights Watch also interviewed 12 Kenyan and international civil society activists and community volunteers providing services to women. Human Rights Watch identified significant barriers that prevent many survivors from getting even basic medical and mental health support services and from seeking justice.</p>\n<div data-type=\"promo_box\">\n<div>\n<article data-eq-pts=\"large: 728\">\n<span></span>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/14/witness-silently-struggling-rape-kenya\">\n<img width=\"832\" alt=\"Witness: Silently Struggling with Rape in Kenya\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16x9/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712wrd_kenya_sv_0.jpg?itok=uSYahuJT\" height=\"468\">\n</a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<h2> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/14/witness-silently-struggling-rape-kenya\">\nWitness: Silently Struggling with Rape in Kenya </a>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Judith was raped during Kenya’s 2017 elections and police arrested no one.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/14/witness-silently-struggling-rape-kenya\">Read Judith’s story</a> </div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The women and girls interviewed described brutal gang rapes involving two or more attackers. Many said that they were raped vaginally and anally, that they were penetrated with objects, or that dirt was inserted into their private parts. Some were raped in the presence of family members, including young children. Most women said they were raped by policemen or men in uniform, many of whom carried guns, batons, teargas canisters, whips, and wore helmets and other anti-riot gear. In at least one case, a girl died after being raped.</p>\n<p>A 27-year-old woman interviewed had given birth on August 7, and was raped by three policemen on August 11. “I feel useless,” she said, describing her life afterward. “I don’t speak to people. I feel so sad. I feel as if I have reached the end. I think of killing myself.”</p>\n<p>Many women and girls said they suffered incapacitating physical injury or experienced other health consequences that left some unable to work or care for their families. Young girls said they experience nightmares, lack of sleep, listlessness, fear, and anxiety that limits their ability to study.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312381\">\n<img alt=\"Judith Wavinya (not her real name), 30, was attacked by two men on the night of August 11, 2017, as she was walking home.\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_violence_main.jpg?itok=X8pAcwFf 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_violence_main.jpg?itok=lIJKcGnN 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_violence_main.jpg?itok=KjZhry1x 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/946w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_violence_main.jpg?itok=jAWsnIXj 946w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_violence_main.jpg?itok=CiWkdAvh 1070w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_violence_main.jpg?itok=QInImCpl\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312381\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p>Judith Wavinya (not her real name), 30, was attacked by two men on the night of August 11, 2017, as she was walking home.

She is one of the few survivors who sought medical treatment immediately after the rape, but says she continues to experience chronic and incapacitating health problems including back pain, pain when passing stool and injuries to her left ear—that she says does not hear well since the attack. She stopped working and is struggling to provide for herself and her three young children. Her husband, who had abandoned her before the rape, stopped giving financial support after he learned that she was raped. </p>\n</span>\n<span> © 2017 Bonnie Katei for Human Rights Watch</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>Most had not received post-rape medical or psychological care, including medication to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and unwanted pregnancy. Barriers included insecurity, the cost of services or transportation, stigma, a lack of health facilities, and a lack of information about the importance of timely treatment or where survivors could get free treatment. Some women who received medical treatment said that the services were not comprehensive, there was no forensic documentation of sexual violence, or that they did not get appropriate referrals for medical treatment, counseling support, or to the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>A history of impunity for sexual violence in Kenya seriously undermines women’s ability to report sexual crimes to the police, Human Rights Watch said. Very few women said they made police reports, and many expressed a lack of confidence in the police due to a long history of human rights abuses and corruption. Others said they feared retaliation. Some women who did try to report sexual violence said that police sent them away without taking statements, ridiculed or verbally abused them, or failed to follow up on complaints.<article>\n<span></span> <figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/14/they-were-men-uniform/sexual-violence-against-women-and-girls-kenyas-2017\">\n<img width=\"289\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/cover/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_kenya_reportcover.jpg?itok=2KZMjX5U\" height=\"374\"> </a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<div><time datetime=\"2017-12-14T02:00:01-05:00\">December 14, 2017</time> <span>Report</span></div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/14/they-were-men-uniform/sexual-violence-against-women-and-girls-kenyas-2017\">“They Were Men in Uniform”</a></h3>\n<p>Sexual Violence against Women and Girls in Kenya’s 2017 Elections</p>\n<div><ul><li><span><img alt=\"PDF icon\" title=\"application/pdf\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png\"> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/kenya1217_web.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf; length=824118\" title=\"kenya1217_web.pdf\">Download the full report in English</a></span></li> </ul></div> </div>\n</article>\n\n<p>One woman who said she was raped in the presence of police, along with five other women, described what happen when they tried to report the attack: “They asked, ‘How do you know they were police?’ They said, ‘If you had been raped you would have gone to hospital first. Where is the evidence? How can we believe you?’ They told us we must have enjoyed the rape.”</p>\n<p>The Kenyan government has long ignored election-related sexual crimes and victims’ suffering, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of women and girls are estimated to have been raped during the 2007-2008 political violence, including by state security agents. They continue to suffer serious physical and psychological trauma, and socioeconomic hardship almost a decade later, and very few cases have been properly investigated or attackers held accountable.</p>\n<p>Past government plans to assist victims of the 2007-2008 violence have excluded rape survivors, and they have not received medical or other assistance. Barriers to reporting, problems with the collection of forensic evidence, and the unwillingness of authorities to initiate genuine, credible, and fair investigations and prosecutions to punish attackers were key challenges in Kenya after the 2007-2008 election-related rapes, and remain a problem.</p>\n<p>The Kenyan government should change its approach. It should ensure that all sexual assault victims get timely, quality, and confidential post-rape treatment, including psychosocial, or mental health, care for themselves and their families, and inform communities where victims can get post-rape care, including free treatment. The Kenyan government should ensure that credible investigations are conducted into all allegations of elections-related sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence survivors should not be left suffering and ashamed of being victims while the Kenyan government shows no shame at failing to meet their needs or to prosecute their attackers,” Odhiambo said. “Instead of downplaying the election-related sexual abuse, the Kenyan government should ensure that all survivors get appropriate medical care and justice.”</p>\n<h2>Selected Accounts</h2>\n<p>Names of victims have been changed for their protection.</p>\n<p>Rose Otieno, 37, was in her house with her five children on the night of August 11. She said that two men dressed in green-and-black uniforms, boots, and helmets broke into her house. One had a gun, the other a baton and a whip. They asked her where her husband was. “One asked me to say, ‘I do not support Raila [Odinga, the presidential challenger], I support Uhuru [Kenyatta, the winner].’ I refused…. The other one said, ‘Let’s teach her a lesson.’ He raped me in the presence of my children.” She said that due to the stigma and rejection attached to rape: “I didn’t go to hospital. I feared, I was ashamed. I have never gone to hospital. I feared because if you tell someone, even the doctor, you will hear about it.”</p>\n<p>Liz Nzau said that she was on her way home from work on the night of August 11 when she met a group of young Kikuyu men who were out celebrating Kenyatta’s victory. They asked her, “Why are you not joining the celebration? You are Luo, you are NASA [National Super Alliance] supporter.” She said: “They took me into a shack where there were five other women. They brought some dirty-looking men who raped us as police walked around the shack. They were moving from one woman to another. They were slapping us and beating us with a rubber whip, and urinating on us. One of the women had her [menstrual] period and they wore a plastic paper bag when raping her. One of the women said they inserted a medicine bottle in her anus.”</p>\n<p>On August 11, Gladys Moraa went to help her neighbor’s young child, who had been hit with a teargas canister. In the ensuing chaos, Grace tripped and fell: “A police officer kicked me on my upper back with his booted feet. I couldn’t move. He raped me and left. Another one came, kicked me on the stomach and back, and raped me. I thought I would die. I was in serious pain.” “My back pains a lot,” she said. “My business was destroyed, and now I do casual work washing for people. But most of the time it is difficult. I have problems bending.”</p>\n<p>Gladys Moraa said that since she was raped: “even a slight sound scares me. I used to have nightmares. If I got counseling, it would really help me. I feel so sad when I remember. I was not counseled at the hospital.” Moraa heard a scream as a Human Rights Watch researcher was interviewing her and she jumped out of her seat saying, “Are those the police? Are those police?”</p>\n<p>Purity Onyancha said that her 17-year-old daughter, Peris Onyancha, and a friend were gang raped together on August 14. Peris was left for dead, and her friend died following the rape. “She trembles when she sees boys,” the mother said. “I am worried about her mental health, and how she will perform at school. Sometimes her teacher calls me to say she is not talking, or she’s just walking around the school. When I talk to her, she says she is feeling dizzy and has headache, but when she is checked in the hospital there is nothing.”</p>\n<p>Mercy Maina and her sister were raped on the night of August 13 by men she described as “police with rastas [dreadlocks].” She said that since the rape, “I feel pain during sex and there is a yellowish discharge. I smell and I have to shower many times a day. When I go near people I feel anxious, like they will smell me.”</p>\n<p>Grace Kungu said she was raped on August 12 on her way home from work:</p>\n<p>&quot;They took me to an unfinished building and all four raped me in front [vaginally] and behind [anally]. Since that day, when I am pressed urine just comes out. Even stool, if I hold for long I find that I have stained my underwear. I wear a sanitary pad sometimes or tissue or a handkerchief to prevent leakage. I have a lot of pain in my lower abdomen. I take painkillers all the time.&quot;</p>",

But it’s a mixed picture.</p>\n<p>Look at freedom of expression and media. On one hand, registered media outlets in Uzbekistan have begun to cover politically sensitive topics: the popular Uzbek-language daily <a href=\"http://kun.uz/\"><em>Kun.uz</em></a>, for example, has written about officials forcing public sector workers and students to pick cotton, despite an official ban on such mobilization. Reporting on this would have been unthinkable under the late president, Islam Karimov.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/309857\">\n<img alt=\"201710eca_uzbekistan_bobomurod\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201710eca_uzbekistan_bobomurod.jpg?itok=ioAkfZ8B 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201710eca_uzbekistan_bobomurod.jpg?itok=dlrmewBc 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201710eca_uzbekistan_bobomurod.jpg?itok=ns7vpjEd 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201710eca_uzbekistan_bobomurod.jpg?itok=OnVGG_NI 800w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2017/201710eca_uzbekistan_bobomurod.jpg?itok=pdGF2EsR\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/309857\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p>Journalist Bobomurod Abdullaev was detained by Uzbek security services in Tashkent on September 27, 2017 and is currently facing up to twenty years for “anti-constitutional activity.” © Fergana News Agency</p>\n<p> </p>\n</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\nMoreover, several journalists I met working for outlets still blocked in Uzbekistan told me they can now report on more sensitive topics, such as the president’s own family.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, journalists are still arrested. In September, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/04/uzbekistan-2-activists-freed-others-arrested\">security services detained journalist Bobomurod Abdullaev</a> on a politically motivated charge. He faces 20 years imprisonment and has been denied access to his family and attorney for nearly three months.</p>\n<p>Police detained writer Nurullo Otahonov after he returned to the country following two years of exile. He was charged with extremism for his book, <em>Bu</em> <em>Kunlar</em> (“These Days”), which criticized Karimov, and is still under house arrest. A third blogger, Hayot Nasretdinov, was arrested in October on charges similar to those facing Abdullaev.</p>\n<p>Also, Uzbekistan’s internet is still highly censored. Many websites are blocked, including independent media, <em>Fergana</em> and Radio Ozodlik.</p>\n<p>The dual nature of the country’s conflicted approach to press freedom hit me personally last month when the popular <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia\">Russian</a>-language website, <em>Podrobno.uz</em>, interviewed me about the work of Human Rights Watch in Uzbekistan.</p>\n<p>The most notable thing about the <a href=\"http://podrobno.uz/cat/obchestvo/stiv-sverdlov-uzbekistan-otkryvaet-novuyu-glavu-v-oblasti-prav-cheloveka-i-svobody-slova/?utm_source=uznet.press\">interview</a> is that it happened at all. No officially registered media outlet has ever covered the work of an independent human rights group – except to recount official denials of our critical reports.</p>\n<p>But the resulting story reveals just how far Uzbekistan has to go.</p>\n<p><em>Podrobno.uz</em> included everything I said about the positive changes we documented, such as the release of political prisoners. But the story omitted all the criticisms I made about the recent arrests of journalists, of widespread torture, of forced labor, and of restrictions on civil society.</p>\n<p>In short, self-censorship is still alive and well in Uzbekistan.</p>\n<p>The incident reminds us that passing laws and announcing reforms do not alone amount to meaningful change. President Mirziyoyev should make clear that criticisms of government policies will not merely be tolerated, but welcomed. This is the only way to move beyond the dark legacy of the past.</p>",

I am one of them. Now, I fear that the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/united-states\">US</a> Department of Education will make it even harder for survivors like me to come forward.</p>\n<p>During my freshman spring at Dartmouth College, I ran into a man I had only met once at a social gathering. Afterwards, he led me to his room to continue a conversation, but then became aggressive. He repeatedly ignored my calls to stop, and I became numb as I lost control of my body. Because there were no witnesses, and I took days to process the event, reporting it to police and taking him to court seemed hopeless. I feared social stigma, reprisal, and academic repercussions from the hours needed to report. He graduated that spring.</p>\n<p>Earlier that year, my 18-year-old classmate was raped by a man who entered her room while she was asleep. She notified the police and I watched as she withstood weeks of fierce and skeptical cross-examination by a famous attorney. The trial, which included character witness testimony focused on the fact that she had previously drank alcohol and invited overnight guests, resulted in a not guilty verdict. Her attacker was cleared of seven charges of rape and finished his degree. My classmate transferred to another university.</p>\n<p>The lesson my friends and I learned was this – stay silent, or be victimized further. The process of reporting an assault can retraumatize a survivor and the system is often stacked against victims in a variety of ways, as <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/24/us-dc-police-mishandle-sexual-assault-cases\">Human Rights Watch researchers found in a 2014 study of the police’s handling of sexual assault cases in Washington, DC</a>.</p>\n<p>Properly enforced legislation like <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm\">Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972</a>, which prohibits sex discrimination in education, can help stop violence against women. While Title IX is known for opening up athletic opportunities for female students, it also requires federally funded educational institutions to prevent and respond to sexual harassment and assault. Implementation has been patchy, but <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf\">Obama-era guidance elaborated schools’ obligations</a> and marked a <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-20-Page-Letter-Changed/239141\">new era of increased scrutiny and enforcement</a>.</p>\n<p>But in September, <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-title-ix-201709.pdf\">the Department of Education issued a letter</a> rescinding this guidance. <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2017/07/13/trump-administration-official-sorry-for-casting-doubt-on-90-percent-of-campus-sexual-assault-claims/\">Candice Jackson, then the department’s acting head of civil rights said</a>, 90 percent of campus sexual assault allegations either, “fall into the category of, ‘we were both drunk,’” or, “we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.” Jackson later apologized for this dangerous misrepresentation, but the Trump administration has yet to give us any reason to have faith in its intentions. They also said police are better equipped to handle campus rape. But the truth is that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/05/08/getting-serious-about-ending-campus-rape\">police often fail</a> – and even re-traumatize – women who come forward to report sexual assault.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv16_sum.pdf\">Rape is already extremely underreported in the US</a>, especially by <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5176\">students survivors</a>. In this #MeToo moment, the government should be strengthening, not walking back support to survivors.</p>",

Which is why, about six months ago, a local family turned to her for help when their 6 and 7-year-old daughters complained of abdominal pain. After examining the girls, Farida found they had injuries consistent with sexual assault, and reported this to the district prosecutor’s office.</p>\n<p>Over the next two months, the girls were sent three times for so-called “virginity examinations” – invasive procedures Afghan government doctors perform, purportedly to determine whether a woman or girl is a “virgin.” In reality, these tests have no scientific validity and can constitute sexual assault. The <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/01/un-who-condemns-virginity-tests\">World Health Organization has called them degrading</a> and urges health workers not to perform them. For the girls Farida tried to help, the trauma and humiliation of repeated examinations compounded the initial abuse. When the girls’ parents brought them to a clinic for the third time, they sobbed and begged not to be tested again.</p>\n<p>The girls’ attacker – a 17-year-old boy – was ultimately convicted of sexual assault. But because the “virginity test” could not prove that penetration had occurred, the judge threatened the midwife, saying, “I could sentence you to imprisonment for false reporting [of rape], but I forgive you this time, as you are a woman, but be careful in the future.” Farida, who told us she had followed appropriate procedure in reporting the girls’ injuries, also faced trouble at home; her neighbors said she had dishonored their community by reporting the case in the first place. As a result, future cases of sexual violence in the village are more likely to go unreported.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.aihrc.org.af/media/files/Forced%20Gynecological%20Exams%20-Egnlish.pdf\">2016 report, the Afghan government’s Independent Human Rights Commission called “virginity tests” a form of sexual assault</a> that should be abolished. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/world/asia/despite-ban-invasive-virginity-tests-remain-prevalent-in-afghanistan.html?_r=0\">Afghan officials claim that the government had since banned the examinations</a>, but officials have told Human Rights Watch that the practice remains widespread, and many judges, prosecutors, and police officials told us they routinely order virginity tests.</p>\n<p>Until the Afghan government completely ends this abusive practice and addresses rampant discrimination against women and girls in the criminal justice system, victims of sexual assault will remain silent lest they be assaulted all over again.</p>",

All sites loaded at comparable speeds. Because I live in the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/united-states\">United States</a>, this might soon be a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is set to repeal the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/23/us-net-neutrality-rules-turn-2-uncertain-future\">2015 Open Internet Rules</a>, better known as net neutrality. Net neutrality is the principle that your internet access provider must treat all content on the internet equally. It prevents cable companies from blocking sites or prioritizing faster access to websites that have paid extra.</p>\n<p>The FCC is made up of five members and is currently chaired by Trump appointee Ajit Pai. Since <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/12/how-trump-appointee-proposal-undermines-free-expression-internet\">Pai outlined his goal to dismantle the open internet earlier this year</a>, there has been a public outcry resulting in <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=17-108&sort=date_disseminated,DESC\">23 million comments</a> (of which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/isp-funded-study-finds-huge-support-for-keeping-current-net-neutrality-rules/\">98.5 percent of unique comments oppose the repeal plan</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html\">denouncements from his fellow FCC members</a>.</p>\n<p>What’s at stake? Your right to <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/SR2017ReporttoHRC.aspx\">freedom of expression and access to information</a>. If a majority of the FCC votes for gutting net neutrality, your internet risks being limited to websites belonging to companies that can afford to pay off the cable companies to prioritize their content. This, in turn, limits your access to information to what these specific websites offer, and your online speech to their publishing and communication platforms. In one FCC vote, we could see the internet reduced to social media giants and shopping websites, and we could lose equal access to all the little random, odd corners that make the internet the magical (and weird) place it is today.</p>\n<p>But all is not yet lost. The FCC must still answer to the US Congress, so if you’re in the United States head over to <a href=\"https://www.battleforthenet.com/\">Battle for the Net and reach out now</a>. Tell your representatives that you reject allowing internet access providers to censor or choose what websites we can easily access before tomorrow’s FCC vote. </p>",

Governments supporting the five-nation force should also act to improve governance and the rule of law in the region.</p>\n<p>\tThe participating countries – <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/africa/mali\">Mali</a>, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad – and key political and financial backers including France, Germany, the African Union, the European Union, the US, and Saudi Arabia are meeting on December 13, 2017, in Paris to discuss financial, military, and political mobilization for the force. A donor conference will be held in Brussels on December 14. The initial phase of G5 Sahel operations, which began in early November, will be to secure Mali’s borders.</p>\n<p>\t“As the G5 Sahel force faces the growing presence of Islamist armed groups in Mali and elsewhere in the Sahel, it will need to scrupulously respect rights in its operations and ensure prompt and impartial investigations of alleged abuses by its personnel,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/corinne-dufka\">Corinne Dufka</a>, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Failure to do so will only increase local support for the armed groups and deepen the growing security crisis.”</p>\n<p>\tThe G5 Sahel force, headquartered in the central Mali garrison town of Sévaré, will eventually comprise 5,000 soldiers from seven battalions and will coordinate operations with 4,000 French troops operating regionally and the 12,000-member United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA.) The peacekeepers will provide logistical and operational support, as authorized in <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc13112.doc.htm\">Security Council resolution</a> 2391 of December 8. The EU pledged US$56 million, the United States US$60 million, and Saudi Arabia US$100 million to support the joint force.</p>\n<p>\tSerious <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/08/mali-unchecked-abuses-military-operations\">abuses by some security forces</a> participating in the previous multinational force make clear the need for all armed forces to minimize harm to civilians and ensure the humane treatment of prisoners, in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law.</p>\n<p>\tThe G5 Sahel force will largely concentrate its operations in Mali, where the human rights situation has grown increasingly precarious during 2017. Throughout the year, Islamist armed groups have increased attacks on government forces and UN peacekeepers. As the peace process that was envisioned to end the 2012-2013 political-military crisis in Mali stalled, armed groups in the north made scant progress on promised disarmament and the government made inadequate progress on restoring state authority. This deepened a rule-of-law vacuum, facilitating rampant banditry.</p>\n<p>\tThe situation in central Mali raises particular concerns, Human Rights Watch said. Since 2015, victims of abuses and witnesses in the region have told Human Rights Watch, Islamist fighters executed at least 50 alleged informants, including village chiefs and local officials; closed down schools; forced women to cover themselves; recruited children; and beat villagers who engaged in cultural practices the Islamists have forbidden. Since late 2016, they have also imposed their version of Sharia, establishing courts that did not adhere to fair trial standards.</p>\n<p>\tHowever, many villagers said they welcomed the presence of the Islamist groups in central Mali, which they see as a benevolent alternative to a state they associate with predatory and abusive governance. Many villagers said they welcomed Islamist efforts to investigate and punish livestock thieves, including by executions. Some praised Sharia rulings in favor of victims of domestic violence or spousal abandonment. Others expressed anger at Malian army abuses during counterterrorism operations.</p>\n<p>\tHuman Rights Watch in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/08/mali-unchecked-abuses-military-operations\">September</a> documented serious abuses during Mali and Burkina Faso military operations in central Mali. Since late 2016, Malian forces have committed extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary arrests against men accused of supporting Islamist armed groups, while a June 2017 cross-border operation by Burkinabe forces resulted in arbitrary detentions and left two suspects dead.</p>\n<p>\tUnder the laws of war, civilians may not be the deliberate target of attack, and warring parties are required to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects. Attacks that fail to discriminate between combatants and civilians, or that would cause disproportionate harm to civilians, are prohibited. Abuses against civilians and captured combatants, including murder, torture, and other ill-treatment, may amount to war crimes.</p>\n<p>\tThe Malian military has made little effort to hold soldiers or militiamen implicated in abuses to account over the years. However, in October, Mali’s Defense Ministry <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/03/mali-defense-ministry-promises-abuse-inquiry\">promised an internal investigation</a> into alleged abuses by their forces in central Mali. Burkina Faso authorities also promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Djibo.</p>\n<p>\tAs the G5 Sahel governments and the force’s financial backers finalize operational plans, they should also help Mali address the issues underlying decades of insecurity and the growing support for the Islamist armed groups, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>\t“A counterterrorism strategy in the Sahel should address more than the presence of Islamist armed groups but also needs to combat the problems at the core of insecurity: weak rule-of-law institutions and abusive governance,” Dufka said.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Recommendations to G5 Sahel Joint Force Member Countries and Financial Supporters</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Include in the operational planning process lawyers with experience applying the laws of war, war crimes, and command responsibility;</li>\n<li>During operations, include military police – or those exercising the provost marshal function – mandated to monitor respect for international humanitarian law during military operations and respond to disciplinary lapses by soldiers;</li>\n<li>Establish a 24-hour telephone hotline for victims and witnesses to report abuses by all sides and ensure effective and rapid communication between hotline staff, Malian authorities mandated to protect civilians, and UN peacekeepers;</li>\n<li>Investigate and prosecute, in accordance with international fair trial standards, members of the security forces implicated in serious human rights violations, regardless of position or rank – including those liable under command responsibility for their failure to prevent or prosecute these crimes;</li>\n<li>Seek or provide international assistance should local authorities have inadequate capacity to carry out credible, impartial, and independent investigations and prosecutions;</li>\n<li>Ensure the G5 Sahel force does not use abusive militia groups in any capacity;</li>\n<li>Encourage the national human rights institutions in Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Chad to fulfill their respective mandates to impartially investigate and report on human rights violations in their territories or involving their respective countries;</li>\n<li>Urge the MINUSMA human rights section to engage in more public reporting on rights violations by all sides; and</li>\n<li>Ensure that all children detained during G5 Sahel operations are placed in a specialized interim care center managed by UNICEF, the UN children’s rights agency, in accordance with a 2013 protocol for the release, transfer and protection of children associated with armed groups.</li>\n</ul>",

Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented numerous cases of torture of detainees there.</p>\n<p>\tHe was held incommunicado, without charge and without access to his family or a lawyer until December 4. He was then transferred to an official jail in Rumonge, south of Bujumbura, where he remains.</p>\n<p>\t“Nibitanga’s arrest is just the latest in a broader crackdown on independent human rights activists and journalists in Burundi,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/ida-sawyer\">Ida Sawyer</a>, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “While many independent activists and journalists in Burundi have been forced into exile, the arrest of Nibitanga sends a chilling message to the few who have remained behind that they stay at their own peril.”</p>\n<p>\tFormer detainees at the intelligence headquarters have told Human Rights Watch about being <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/burundi-intelligence-services-torture-suspected-opponents\">unlawfully detained and tortured</a> there in recent years. They said SNR agents beat alleged opposition sympathizers with hammers and steel construction bars, drove sharpened steel rods into their legs, dripped melting plastic on them, tied cords around men’s genitals, and used electric shocks.</p>\n<p>\tNibitanga was the regional observer for the central and eastern parts of the country for the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Detained Persons (Association pour la protection des droits humains et des personnes détenues, APRODH), the leading Burundian human rights organization, before the government shut it down in October 2016. His job included coordinating staff and collecting information on human rights violations in four provinces: Gitega, Cankuzo, Ruyigi, and Karuzi. He also made routine visits to detention centers.</p>\n<p>\tNibitanga’s arrest follows that of <a href=\"https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/germain-rukuki-detained\">Germain Rukuki</a>, a former member of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture in Burundi (ACAT-Burundi) in July 2017. ACAT-Burundi was also closed in October 2016. Rukuki was also first held by the SNR before being transferred to Ngozi prison. He was later accused of “undermining state security” and “rebellion.” Rukuki was denied bail and remains in Ngozi prison, awaiting trial.</p>\n<p>\tThese recent arrests follow a pattern of government crackdowns against opponents, critics, journalists, and human rights defenders since early 2015, after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would seek a controversial third term. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/burundi\">many leading Burundian human rights defenders and independent journalists fled the country</a> for their security. In August 2015, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, the president of APRODH, was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/03/burundi-leading-human-rights-defender-shot\">shot in the face and neck</a> by an unidentified assailant while driving home from the organization’s office.</p>\n<p>\tMbonimpa had been <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/05/17/burundi-leading-rights-activist-arrested\">arrested in May 2014</a> and charged with endangering state security, in connection with remarks he had made on the radio. After he became seriously ill, he was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/09/29/burundi-human-rights-activist-freed\">provisionally released</a> on medical grounds, but the charges against him were not dropped.</p>\n<p>\tJournalists have also been <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/18/burundi-journalist-be-freed-bail\">punished</a> simply for broadcasting information on controversial or sensitive issues. Since 2015, authorities have arrested numerous journalists and ransacked media offices. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/22/where-burundian-journalist-jean-bigirimana\">Jean Bigirimana</a>, a journalist for the <em>Iwacu</em> newspaper, has been missing since July 2016. He was rumored to have been arrested by intelligence agents.</p>\n<p>\tHundreds of people have been abducted, disappeared, reported missing, or found dead in mysterious circumstances in Burundi since 2015. The government very rarely investigates these cases. In this tense climate, Burundi’s cabinet in November <a href=\"http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Burundi-government-backs-constitution-change/2558-4157702-ravgxh/index.html\">backed changes to the constitution</a> that would allow Nkurunziza to run for additional terms.</p>\n<p>\tIn September, a <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22016&LangID=E\">UN-mandated commission of inquiry</a> indicated that there were reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed in Burundi, including murder, torture, rape, imprisonment, and persecution, against a backdrop of almost total impunity. In November, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/09/icc-new-burundi-investigation\">International Criminal Court</a> opened an investigation into crimes committed there.</p>\n<p>\t“The authorities’ targeting of activists and journalists shows how far they are willing to go to silence those who might dare to speak out,” Sawyer said. “Burundi’s international partners should press the government to allow journalists and activists to do their work freely, and to stop illegal detention and torture by the intelligence agency.” </p>",

This campaign significantly expands authorities’ collection of biodata beyond <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/15/china-police-dna-database-threatens-privacy\">previous government efforts</a> in the region, which only required all passport applicants in Xinjiang to supply biometrics.</p>\n<p>For all “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/06/20/tibet-glossary-repression\">focus personnel</a>” – those authorities consider threatening to regime stability – and their family members, their biometrics must be taken regardless of age. Authorities are gathering the biodata in different ways. DNA and blood types are being collected through a free annual physical exams program called Physicals for All. It is unclear if the participants of the physicals are informed of the authorities’ intention to collect, store, or use sensitive DNA data.</p>\n<p>“Xinjiang authorities should rename their physical exams project ‘Privacy Violations for All,’ as informed consent and real choice does not seem to be part of these programs,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sophie-richardson\">Sophie Richardson</a>, China director. “The mandatory databanking of a whole population’s biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it’s even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program.”</p>\n<p>The biometric collection scheme is detailed in an official document called “The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population” (全区人口精准登记核实工作指南, “The Population Registration Program”), available in full on the <a href=\"http://www.akss.gov.cn/xjcms/front/s3/c106/20170921/i20143.html\">government website</a> of Aksu city in Xinjiang (an unofficial translation is available below).</p>\n<p>The guidelines are undated, but the Aksu government’s notice distributing it to lower-level offices was dated July 2, 2017. According to state media reports, the Xinjiang government <a href=\"http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1624092\">authorized the Population Registration Program in February 2017</a>, and specified that it would be carried out “in stages.” A county government in Tacheng prefecture, for example, has a <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7GGzGqtvtOMJ:www.xjtc.gov.cn/info/1216/137837.htm+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=hk\">timetable</a> that states it began collecting biodata around mid-June and completed it by end of November 2017. The Xinjiang-wide Physicals for All program <a href=\"http://www.xjbs.com.cn/zphd/2017-07/25/cms1990019article.shtml\">started</a> around July and was <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2017-11/02/content_5236389.htm\">completed</a> October 2017.\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nThe mandatory databanking of a whole population’s biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it’s even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Sophie Richardson </h4>\n<p>China Director</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>The guidelines were issued by the region’s Office of Population Service and Management and Real Name Registration Work Leadership Committee (自治区人口服务管理和实名制工作领导小组办公室). It is unclear precisely which government department this office reports to, though “population management” is usually under the supervision of the police.</p>\n<p>Authorities state that the Population Registration Program is meant for “scientific decision-making” that promotes poverty alleviation, better management, and “social stability.” Authorities have offered the annual Physicals for All program since 2016, characterizing it as a benefit for the relatively economically poor region. The program’s stated goals are to improve the service delivery of health authorities, to screen and detect for major diseases, and to establish digital health records for all residents. Press reports about Physicals for All include testimonies from participants describing how they received treatments for previously undiagnosed illnesses, and in some cases saving their lives.</p>\n<p>According to the guidelines, different authorities are responsible for different types of biometric collection. Party cadres and police officers are responsible for collecting pictures, fingerprints and iris scans, and “household registration” (or <em>hukou</em>) information using mobile apps designed for such purpose either during home visits, or by setting up central collection points. Local health authorities are responsible for collecting DNA and blood type information “as part of” the Physicals for All program, according to the guidelines. The collected blood type information is directly sent to the police, while the “blood cards for DNA collection will be sent to the county police bureaus for profiling.” All of this information is stored and linked to an individual’s national identification number.</p>\n<p>The guidelines say the biometric collection will be comprehensive: officials have “to ensure that [information from] every household in every village, every person in every household, every item for every person” will be collected. There is no indication that people can opt out of the collection, or any requirement of informed consent.</p>\n<p>While media reports and <a href=\"http://www.xinyuan.gov.cn/info/egovinfo/1005/common/inf_content/xy025-13_A/2017-0712002.htm\">official implementing documents</a> about Physicals for All outline a range of medical tests involved, including ultrasounds, electrocardiograms, and “routine blood works,” they give no indication that DNA will be collected as part of the tests. It also does not appear that the government has disclosed to the public or to participants the full range of how collected medical information will be used and disseminated or how long it will be stored. While official media reports stress that participation in the Physicals for All <a href=\"http://www.htb.gov.cn/xwdt/cxdt/141549.htm\">program should be voluntary</a>, it appears that in practice people are expected – and sometimes pressured – to participate.</p>\n<p>One Uyghur who participated in the 2016 Physicals for All program in Kashgar in western Xinjiang told Human Rights Watch that his neighborhood committee “had demanded that they [people in his neighborhood] must participate in the physicals.” He did not think he had a choice in the matter, as “not participating would surely be seen as a sign of ‘thought problem,’” a shorthand for “political disloyalty,” a dangerous label in the repressive region. He said the health authorities had not told him afterward the results of his physical.</p>\n<p>“China has few meaningful privacy protections and Uyghurs are already subjected to extensive degrees of control and surveillance, including heavy security presence, numerous checkpoints, and routine inspection of smartphones for ‘subversive’ content,” Richardson said. “In this context, compulsory biodata collection has particularly abusive potential, and hardly seems justifiable as a security measure.”</p>\n<p>An October 2017 report by the Ili health authorities says the government “<a href=\"http://www.yili.gov.cn/info/1067/125196.htm\">has to ensure that those who should participate in the physicals do participate</a>.” While a June 2017 report by the <em>Ili Evening Post </em>says “<a href=\"http://www.ylxw.com.cn/2017/0609/96399.shtml\">for those unwilling to participate in the physicals…cadres have to…work hard to convince them to participate</a>,” suggesting that officials may put pressure on residents who refuse to take part. This practice is not consistent with international human rights norms which require that medical interventions, including medical tests, be conducted only with the free and informed consent of the individual.</p>\n<p>A Xinhua article dated November 1, 2017, states that 18.8 million people participated in the Physicals for All program in 2017.</p>\n<p>The guidelines suggest that biometric collection is a permanent measure. Police are now required to ensure that all such information is collected from anyone in Xinjiang before they conduct any “hukou-related business,” such as enrolling in public schools and applying for passports. Even people who have Xinjiang <em>hukou</em> but live outside the region are required to submit such information to “the Xinjiang Population Services and Management Committee(s) in the Mainland.”</p>\n<p>A number of local governments in different parts of Xinjiang – <a href=\"http://www.xjyn.gov.cn/info/egovinfo/1005/common/inf_content/ynx001-14_A/2017-1122001.htm\">Yining county</a>, <a href=\"http://www.evernote.com/l/APThXWKI40hBSqlAp-uh2jOAoMUvQOO7ZSs/\">Tacheng prefecture</a>, <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZkyEnXuo6fcJ:21t.nes.gov.cn/jgsz/71131.htm+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=hk\">Tiemenguan city</a> (which is part of the Xinjiang Military Corps), <a href=\"http://www.xjkel.gov.cn/gk/zcfg/gfxwj/fzbfw/188157.htm\">Korla city</a>, and <a href=\"http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?d=4506255668349742&w=dfvIy1fCHlsBNVK5tJnExMd536AExkEh\">Jinghe county</a> – have issued local versions of the directives instructing the collection of biometrics. The directives in Ili and Tacheng largely reproduce the provincial-level guidelines verbatim. In Tiemenguan, though, the collection of DNA is limited to those aged 14 to 65. The Tiemenguan directive also instructs the propaganda authorities to be responsible for “monitoring public sentiments on the internet” about the biometric collection and to “guide and handle negative information.”\n<figure>\n<span></span>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312519\">\n<img alt=\"201712asia_china_xinjiang2 Police officers check the identity cards of a people as security forces keep watch in a street in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China on March 24, 2017.\" sizes=\"(min-width: 77.5em) 946px, (min-width: 48em) calc(100vw - 120px), (min-width: 37.5em) calc(100vw - 70px), calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/294w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_china_xinjiang2.jpg?itok=jMuM0BZS 294w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/430w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_china_xinjiang2.jpg?itok=19zuFVUR 430w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/676w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_china_xinjiang2.jpg?itok=JFS76rRH 676w, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/1070w/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_china_xinjiang2.jpg?itok=1Y-CNWfA 728w\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16%3A9_946x534/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712asia_china_xinjiang2.jpg?itok=yeWFMcn6\"> </a>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/view-mode/modal/312519\">Expand</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<span><p>Police officers check the identity cards of a people as security forces keep watch in a street in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China on March 24, 2017.</p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2017 Thomas Peter/Reuters</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has previously <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/15/china-police-dna-database-threatens-privacy\">documented that the Xinjiang police had issued calls</a> for tender in September 2016 for DNA sequencers that indicate its intention to build large-scale infrastructure to process DNA samples of and profile a large number of individuals.</p>\n<p>Follow-up research by Human Rights Watch uncovered that a US-based company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, has supplied the Xinjiang police with some of these DNA sequencers. Human Rights Watch wrote to the company in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/letter_to_thermo_june_.pdf\">June</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/letter_to_thermo_august.pdf\">August 2017</a>, informing them that Chinese authorities are collecting DNA from individuals not suspected of crimes in Xinjiang as well as across China, and asking them to comment on a range of issues including their human rights policies and discussions they may have had with Chinese authorities about the intended use of DNA sequencing equipment. In <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/thermo_fisher_response_.pdf\">Thermo Fisher Scientific’s response</a> to the first letter, the company stated that it does not “share information about our customers or their purchases” and that “given the global nature of our operations, it is not possible for us to monitor the use or application of all products we manufactured.” The firm stated that they “expect all of our customers to act in accordance with appropriate regulations and industry-standard best practices.” Thermo Fisher Scientific did not reply to Human Rights Watch’s second, follow-up letter.</p>\n<p>Companies like Thermo Fisher Scientific that supply DNA sequencing and related equipment have a human rights responsibility to avoid contributing to governmental human rights violations. Thermo Fisher Scientific should immediately investigate misuse of their products and suspend future sales or service in China pending such investigation.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch has also <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/15/china-police-dna-database-threatens-privacy\">documented the Chinese police’s searchable, nationwide DNA database</a> with 40 million entries from people, including dissidents and migrants. A DNA database allows police not only to search for an exact match, but also for those who are related family members and could lead to discriminatory profiling.</p>\n<p>Coercing people to give blood samples, or taking blood samples without informed consent or justification can violate an individual’s privacy, dignity, and right to bodily integrity; it can also in some circumstances constitute degrading treatment. Compelled DNA sampling of an entire region or population for purposes of security maintenance is a serious human rights violation in that it cannot be justified as necessary or proportionate.</p>\n<p>The right to respect for confidentiality of medical information is also a core principle of the right to health. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has advised states that “[a]ll health facilities, goods and services must be … designed to respect confidentiality.” While the right to privacy does not establish an absolute rule of confidentiality of medical information, interference or breach of confidentiality must be strictly justified, which is not the case when such collection is intended to routinely be shared with the police and any other agency with access to the database.</p>\n<p>DNA information is highly sensitive and can facilitate a wide array of abuses if it is collected or shared non-consensually. Any compelled collection or use by the government is a serious intrusion on the right to privacy. While the government’s collection of DNA is sometimes justified as a permissible investigative tool, this type of interference with the right to privacy must be comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal. Yet the program described collects DNA information from all individuals, regardless of whether they are in any way linked to a criminal investigation, and does not appear to require informed consent or explanation of why DNA samples are sought. Mandatory and disproportionate collection of other sensitive biometrics, like iris scans, also raises serious human rights concerns about how such data will be secured and used for undisclosed and potentially rights-violating purposes, including surveillance of persons because of ethnicity, religion, opinion or other protected exercise of rights like free speech.</p>\n<p>Xinjiang, in northwestern China, is home to 10 million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. The Chinese government has imposed pervasive restrictions on their fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion. Since the appointment of Party Secretary Chen Quanguo in August 2016, the Xinjiang regional government has enacted further repressive policies, including restricting foreign travel and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/07/egypt-dont-deport-uyghurs-china\">forcing those studying abroad to return</a>, detaining thousands in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/10/china-free-xinjiang-political-education-detainees\">political education facilities</a>, and hiring thousands more as security personnel to monitor the population. Authorities have also ramped up surveillance measures, including by integrating other biometric technology like facial recognition with surveillance systems. Across China, Human Rights Watch has also documented the authorities’ efforts in implementing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/08/18/chinas-dystopian-push-to-revolutionize-surveillance/\">new technological systems</a> for mass surveillance, including the use of big data, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/19/china-police-big-data-systems-violate-privacy-target-dissent\">cloud computing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/22/china-voice-biometric-collection-threatens-privacy\">biometrics</a>.</p>\n<p>“Chinese authorities seem to think they can achieve ‘social stability’ by placing people under a microscope, but these abusive programs are more likely to deepen hostility towards the government,” said Richardson.  “Beijing should immediately stop these programs, and destroy all data gathered without full, informed consent.”</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><u>The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population</u></strong><br>\n </p>\n<p>These guidelines are based on “The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Plan on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population” and are written to systematically and scientifically promote the work of Accurate Registration and Verification of Population, and to accurately verify Xinjiang’s actual population data and to collect multidimensional biometrics information.<br>\n </p>\n<ol><li><strong>Target Mission</strong></li>\n</ol><p>The main goal is to fully and accurately verify the real number of Xinjiang’s population, to collect the images, fingerprints, iris scans, blood types, and DNA biometrics of those between the age of 12 and 65. For “focus personnel” and their immediate families, such information must be collected from everyone regardless of age. Regulating the management of identification cards is the foundation to creating a basic population database, based on one’s ID numbers, for the autonomous region. [This will also] realize the exchange of population information across government agencies, and achieve precise identification and real name registration management.<br>\n </p>\n<ol><li value=\"2\"><strong>Work Responsibilities</strong></li>\n</ol><p>i. All prefecture and city governments should follow the general requirements set out by the regional government, to develop implementation plans and to prepare human, physical, and financial resources to ensure the [implementation of] the work. All county governments will be responsible for carrying out the policy by developing specific measures and by leading and coordinating the work.</p>\n<p>ii. All township governments and neighborhood committees are responsible for organizing the personnel responsible for verifying household registration (<em>hukou</em>) information and collecting biometric data.</p>\n<p>iii. All county governments, township governments, and neighborhood committees should provide training to staff on verification work and require them to be certificated.</p>\n<p>iv. Village and neighborhood Party branch, Party cadres of the “Visit, Benefit and Gather” (访惠聚) program, and police station will form a joint team, led by the village or neighborhood committee’s first Party secretary (for those without a first secretary, the village or neighborhood committee’s Party branch secretaries should be responsible), to carry out the tasks of verifying <em>hukou </em>information and the collection of biometrics using home visits and in a centralized manner.<br>\n </p>\n<ol><li value=\"3\"><strong>Work Requirement</strong></li>\n</ol><p>i. Protect people’s legal rights, guide them to cooperate, and support the work of Accurate Registration and Verification of Population.</p>\n<p>ii. Organize meticulously and carefully make arrangements to ensure that the <em>hukou </em>information for everyone in every household, in every village is completely verified in Xinjiang. No one is to be missed.</p>\n<p>iii. The principle of biometric collection is to proceed from easy to difficult, to promote it from pilot areas, from villages to towns, and from focus personnel to the ordinary masses. The goal is to collect information where information should be collected, and to collect as much data as possible.</p>\n<p>iv. Strictly enforce the requirements of the Working Guidelines. To accurately collect biometric data, ensure that the collected biometrics match with the personal information [of the right person].</p>\n<p>v. The principle is whoever collects the information, that person should be responsible; whoever inputs the information, that person should be responsible; whoever manages the information, that person should be responsible. After collecting and verifying the information, the staff must sign their names in the documents to ensure the quality of the collected information and to strengthen responsibility and accountability.</p>\n<p>vi. Staff responsible for verifying information are not to fabricate, or to tamper with the collected data, nor to share data with outside sources or otherwise leak data unless legally authorized.</p>\n<p>vii. In areas that do not have mobile network coverage, staff can record data on paper or temporarily store the information on mobile devices. When the situation allows, log onto the relevant platforms and databases to upload the data.</p>\n<p>viii. After a long-term data collection system is established and the work of verifying and registering population information has been started in a comprehensive manner, when police agencies handle any hukou-related matters, they should first check to see if biometrics have been collected. Any missing or incomplete information should first be collected before any <em>hukou </em>matters can be conducted.<br>\n </p>\n<ol><li value=\"4\"><strong>Rules on <em>Hukou</em> Information Verification and the Collection of Multidimensional Biometrics Information</strong></li>\n</ol><p>i. Verifying the <em>Hukou </em>Information of Individuals</p>\n<ol><li>Staff conducting verification work will use handheld devices and log on to Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platforms using previously given account information. They will key in the identification numbers of those registered in the administrative area to generate information collection charts for [each] individual.<br>\n </li>\n<li>Staff should verify the name, gender, ethnicity, date of birth, ID number, education level, employer information, and other information of the individual.</li>\n</ol><p>ii. Collecting Multidimensional Biometric Data</p>\n<ol><li>Multidimensional biometric data includes: images, fingerprints, iris scans, blood types, DNA samples, and others.<br>\n </li>\n<li>The collection of biometrics, like images, fingerprints, and iris scans can be done by visiting individual households with biodata collection equipment, or by setting up central collecting points based on geographic and population distribution.<br>\n </li>\n<li>The collection of biometrics like blood types and DNA samples should be carried out by county (city and district level) Health and Family Planning Bureaus at the basic levels as part of the Physicals for All Programs, to ensure the professional collection of blood type and DNA blood cards. The blood type information should be sent to the county level police bureaus while blood cards [for DNA collection] should be sent to the county police bureaus for profiling.<br>\n </li>\n<li value=\"5\"><strong>Handling Various Situations When Verifying <em>Hukou</em> Information</strong></li>\n</ol><p>i. While verifying <em>hukou</em> information, for errors found in the main items (name, gender, ethnicity, date of birth, ID number), the staff should inform the person to bring supporting documents to make corrections at their local police station. Errors found in the supplementary items (education level, employment) can be edited by police officers after gathering supporting documents on the spot, and logging onto the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platform.</p>\n<p>ii. When verifying the information of people who have moved away from the areas where their <em>hukous</em> are registered, if any mismatched information is found between the information they provided and the information on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platform, inform the individuals to go back to the police station where their <em>hukou</em> is registered to make the amendments.</p>\n<p>iii. For the migrant population in Xinjiang, register their information according to the relevant requirements for the management of migrant population, verify their <em>hukou</em> information, and through the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platform, report the verification results and the status of their biometric collection to the local police stations where their <em>hukous</em> are located for examination and approval.</p>\n<p>iv. For those without <em>hukous</em>, input their <em>hukou</em> information according to the requirements, collect their photos, biometric data, and then inform them or their guardians to report, within a certain time limit, to the police station in their area of residence or where they were born to process their <em>hukou</em> registration according to the relevant policies concerning people without <em>hukous</em>.</p>\n<p>v. For those whose information cannot be verified on the spot, after collecting their pictures and multidimensional biodata, report their situation to the police station in the areas where they said their <em>hukous</em> are located, and the latter will verify their information. If verified, connect their biometric data with their <em>hukou</em> information. If not verified, make a note on the data collecting system and try to match it later.</p>\n<p>vi. For migrant populations whose <em>hukou</em> is located outside of Xinjiang, register them according to the relevant regulations concerning the management of migrant populations.<br>\n </p>\n<ol><li value=\"6\"><strong>The Collection and Verification of Information for those with Xinjiang <em>Hukous</em> but Living in the Mainland</strong></li>\n</ol><p>The work of verifying <em>hukou</em> information and collecting biometrics of those with Xinjiang <em>hukous</em> but living in the mainland is the responsibility of the local offices of the Xinjiang Population Services and Management Committees in the mainland and of the local people’s governments entrusted by the Xinjiang government. The Xinjiang Population Services and Management and Real-Name Registration Work Leadership Committee is responsible for the training of personnel, distribution of equipment, and the launching of special accounts for Accurate Population Registration and Verification.</p>",

Over the course of six months in 2014, Ngerng was sued for defamation by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, fired from his job, and charged with unlawful demonstration and public nuisance. In 2016, after he openly supported the opposition candidate in a by-election, the authorities accused him of violating “cooling-off” rules on election advertising and called him in for intensive questioning by the police, who searched his home, seized his mobile phone and computers, and demanded the passwords to his social media accounts.</p>\n<p>Bloggers, cartoonists, lawyers, and the foreign media are among the many who have faced contempt proceedings for criticizing the Singapore judicial system. In the most recent case, the attorney general sought and obtained judicial permission to bring contempt proceedings against Lee’s nephew over a private Facebook post in which he noted that a litigious government and a “pliant” judiciary meant that international media was constrained in what it could report about Singapore.</p>\n<p>Public protests in the city-state are extraordinarily restricted, Human Rights Watch said. The only place where public gatherings that are even remotely political can be held without a police permit is Speakers’ Corner, a section of tiny Hong Lim Park. Even at Speakers’ Corner, there are detailed restrictions on what can be said, and foreigners are barred from speaking or even being present. In one case, activist Jolovan Wham was given a “stern warning” in lieu of prosecution when two Hong Kong citizens participated in a protest he organized in support of Occupy Hong Kong, even though he had announced both in advance and at the event that foreigners were not permitted to participate.</p>\n<p>Under a government order issued in late 2016, foreign or multinational companies are not permitted to support events at Speakers’ Corner without a police permit. The government rejected the applications of 10 multinational companies that applied to support the 2017 Pink Dot celebration of LGBT pride.</p>\n<p>The new report documents how various regulatory restrictions are used to limit discussion of political or “sensitive” issues in plays, films, and on the internet. The government frequently conditions licenses for public performances of politically themed plays on censorship of the script. It effectively prohibits all positive portrayals of LGBT lives on television, radio, or in film. In 2015, the government banned the showing of a promotional video for the annual LGBT Pink Dot celebration, even though the video simply featured a countdown and then the words “Pink Dot” and the date of the event.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch called on the Singapore government to drop all pending charges for peaceful speech or assembly and amend or repeal the laws and regulations that restrict speech or assembly to bring those laws into line with international standards.</p>\n<p>“Singapore’s kneejerk response to sue or prosecute critics has for many years limited critical reporting on the city-state,” Robertson said.  “Singapore’s trading partners should call on the government to modernize its views of human rights and end its repression of speech and assembly.”</p>\n<p><strong>A note about the report title:</strong></p>\n<p>“Killing the chicken to scare the monkeys” is a Chinese proverb used the describe the practice of striking hard at a lesser enemy in order to scare a more powerful one. It was used repeatedly by interviewees during the course of the research for this report to describe the Singapore government’s practice of cracking down hard on those who speak out to send a message to others.  As one interviewee said, “It is less that they want to sue someone than that they want to send a message to others not to say things – to perpetuate a culture of fear.  The person is unfortunate that they happened to fit the circumstances to send the message.”</p>\n<p><strong>Selected Cases of Suppression of Free Expression and Assembly</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jolovan Wham</strong><br>\nActivist Jolovan Wham’s efforts to raise matters of public interest have resulted in repeated criminal investigations and, in November 2017, criminal charges for holding public assemblies without the required police permits. In March 2015, he was given a “stern warning” in lieu of prosecution when two Hong Kong citizens participated in a protest he organized at Speakers’ Corner in support of Occupy Hong Kong, even though he had announced both in advance and at the event that foreigners were not permitted to participate.</p>\n<p>Wham was also called in for questioning regarding his involvement in a November 2016 event at Speakers’ Corner in support of the Malaysia Bersih rally for clean and fair elections, and several events held outside Speakers’ Corner. On November 29, 2017, he was charged with three counts of holding public assemblies without the required police permits. The charges stem from an indoor forum on civil disobedience and social movements, held on November 26, 2016, at which Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong spoke via Skype, a silent protest on an MRT train on June 3, 2017 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the arrest and detention of 22 social activists and volunteers under the Internal Security Act in 1987, and a candlelight vigil held outside Changi Prison on July 13, 2017, to support the family of a Malaysian national, S. Prabagaran, who was slated to be executed the next morning for drug trafficking. Wham was also charged with vandalism for temporarily posting two sheets of paper on the inside of an MRT train during the June protest on the MRT. He faces the possibility of three years in prison on the vandalism charge, and six months in prison or a fine of S$10,000 on the public assembly charges.</p>\n<p><strong>The Independent Singapore</strong><br>\nIn May 2016, police initiated an investigation of the news website The Independent Singapore for violation of the cooling-off rules that prohibit election advertising the day before an election. According to Kumaran Pillai, publisher of The Independent Singapore<em>, </em>“We did what we thought was plain reporting of things that happened before cooling-off day.” Pillai was called in for three rounds of questioning, the first of which lasted 11 hours. The second time he went in, “they threw me in a police car and went to my office, my home.” The police seized his cell phone and two laptops. “I feel I have been stripped,” Pillai said. “They know everything about my life.”</p>\n<p>The police also called in editor Ravi Philemon and lawyer Alfred Dodwell, who is a director of the company, for questioning. “The police powers are what I have a problem with,” says Dodwell. “If we say we were hacked, then they can question and see how it was posted and from which computer. But if we accept that we have posted it… there is absolutely no purpose served by arresting the person, taking devices, and going through them. It is a needless violation of a person’s privacy… The purpose is to instill fear. If you post, the response won’t be a slap on the wrist. You will be arrested, held, your devices seized.”</p>\n<p>On February 16, 2017, the Singapore Police Force issued a press release stating that Pillai, Philemon, and Dodwell had been given “stern warnings” in lieu of prosecution. When asked about the impact of the warning, Pillai responded, “I think the warning is for people not to associate themselves with me and the Independent. If they do and go down that path this is what they will get themselves into. It is a warning for the rest.”</p>\n<p><strong>Roy Ngerng</strong><br>\nNgerng is an activist and popular blogger. In 2012 he started a blog, The Heart Truths<em>, </em>in which he discussed sociopolitical and economic issues affecting Singapore. In early 2014, he began raising concerns about the management of Singapore’s Central Provident Fund, the country’s mandatory pension fund, in a series of blog posts. In an article posted on May 15, Ngerng included two charts comparing the way the CPF was being invested in other funds with the way City Harvest, a church prosecuted for financial fraud, had invested its funds.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sued for defamation, claiming that the post implied that he had misappropriated money from the fund. According to Ngerng, “I didn’t think the Prime Minister would be affected – I was talking about the government, not him.” Less than two weeks later, the 33-year-old was fired from his job at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he was a contract patient coordinator planning programs for people infected with HIV. His employers said he had “misused company time and resources” and called his conduct “incompatible with the values and standards expected of employees.”</p>\n<p>Lee filed for summary judgment and the court found Ngerng guilty of defamation. Lee’s lawyer sought “very high” damages, and the court ordered Ngerng to pay S$100,000 in general damages (US$73,497) and S$50,000 (US$36,759) in aggravated damages. He was also ordered to pay Lee S$29,000 (US$21,314) in legal costs. He has agreed to a payment plan under which he is going to be paying off the damages for the next 17 years.</p>",

The bill permits the commission to grant amnesties to perpetrators who testify truthfully about their role in abuses. While it precludes amnesties for acts that “form part of a crime against humanity,” it does not rule them out for other serious crimes under international law.</p>\n<p>Justice Minister Aboubacarr Tambadou put forward the truth commission legislation after conducting a countrywide consultation process in August. The government also consulted widely with domestic and international nongovernmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch.</p>\n<p>In appointing commissioners, the bill requires Barrow to consult with a range of civil society groups, including victims’ organizations, as well as to consider Gambia’s geographical, regional, and gender diversity. Identifying the right commissioners will be essential for the truth commission to be viewed as independent, impartial, and competent, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>Tambadou told Human Rights Watch that the government will offer individuals the opportunity of an amnesty to encourage them to come forward to disclose their role in past abuses. The bill’s preamble states, “It is important to have an accurate and impartial historical record of the violations, [and] document them for posterity to ensure that ‘never again’ do we encounter a reoccurrence of such abuses.” The commission plans to hold public hearings and publish a final report, with the government required to issue a white paper within six months describing how it will implement the report’s recommendations.</p>\n<p>The bill itself acknowledges that responding to Gambia’s legacy of human rights violations also means addressing the country’s culture of impunity. It empowers the commission to identify and recommend for prosecution the persons who bear the greatest responsibility for human rights violations and other abuses. However, by permitting amnesties for serious crimes that do not amount to crimes against humanity, the law could prevent many Gambian victims from seeking justice, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>As the truth commission advances, the government should also consider whether and how the commission should share evidence with Gambian police and prosecutors investigating grave crimes, Human Rights Watch said. The justice ministry should consider negotiating a formal memorandum of understanding between the truth commission and public prosecutors that sets out how the commission will provide guidance to investigators while preserving the confidentiality of victims and witnesses.</p>\n<p>“Gambia’s truth commission is the first step in efforts to bring justice to victims and hold those responsible for serious crimes accountable,” Wormington said. “Gambia’s international partners should assist the government to ensure that the commission achieves its important aims.”</p>\n<p>In October, Human Rights Watch and Gambian and international groups launched the “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Jammeh2Justice/\">Campaign to Bring Yahya Jammeh and his Accomplices to Justice</a>” (#Jammeh2Justice) to press for Jammeh, as well as those who bear the greatest responsibility for the crimes of his government, to be brought to trial with all due process guarantees. Jammeh now lives in exile in Equatorial Guinea.</p>",

The committee could vote on the final text of the proposed amendment on December 12 before it goes to the full Chamber of Deputies for a vote. To become law and amend the Constitution, the legislation would need a super majority – or three-fifths of votes – in both houses of Congress, and the president’s signature.</p>\n<p>“A total abortion ban would have devastating consequences for women and girls in Brazil,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/jose-miguel-vivanco\">José Miguel Vivanco</a>, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “Under this cruel amendment, even women and girls pregnant as a result of rape and those with life-threatening complications would be forced to either continue their pregnancies against their will or risk imprisonment and other health dangers, including death, by having clandestine abortions.”</p>\n<p>Abortion is legal in Brazil only in cases of rape, when necessary to save a woman’s life, or when the fetus suffers from anencephaly, a fatal congenital brain disorder. Women and girls who terminate pregnancies under any other circumstances face up to three years in prison. According to some <a href=\"http://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,de-1-milhao-de-abortos-ilegais-no-pais-33-viraram-casos-de-policia-em-2014,1610235\">media reports</a>, in 2014 alone, at least 33 women were arrested for abortion, seven of whom were reported by doctors after they went to hospitals in need of post-abortion care.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch documented the consequences of Brazil’s restrictions on abortion in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/12/neglected-and-unprotected/impact-zika-outbreak-women-and-girls-northeastern-brazil\">July report on the impact of the Zika outbreak</a>. Some doctors interviewed for the report said they had treated women and girls in the past year who had used to caustic acid or other unsafe methods to try to induce abortion. One 23-year-old woman who was raped as an adolescent and had heavy bleeding after a clandestine abortion told Human Rights Watch: “I didn’t have a lot of information… I bled a lot.” More than 900 women have died from unsafe abortion in Brazil since 2005, according to Health Ministry data.</p>\n<p>Brazil’s restrictions on abortion are incompatible with its human rights obligations. The criminalization of abortion in Brazil negatively affects many human rights, including women’s rights to life, health, nondiscrimination and equality, privacy, and to be free from torture and from cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment. International human rights treaties require governments to respect women’s reproductive and other human rights. Authoritative interpretations of these treaties by United Nations experts call for the removal of criminal penalties for abortion.</p>\n<p>“Brazil’s existing restrictions on access to abortion already endanger women and girls,” Vivanco said. “The proposed amendment would make the dire situation for reproductive rights in Brazil even worse.”</p>\n<p>There was notable progress on expanding access to reproductive rights in Latin America during 2017, Human Rights Watch said. Chile <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/01/how-chile-ended-its-draconian-ban-abortion\">ended its longstanding total abortion ban</a>, and decriminalized abortion if the life of the pregnant woman is at risk, if the pregnancy is the result of rape, or if the fetus will not survive outside the womb. On December 6, lawmakers in Bolivia <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/bolivia-lawmakers-vote-ease-abortion-limits-51617857\">voted to ease abortion restrictions</a> by allowing adolescent girls to access abortion through the first eight weeks of pregnancy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/25/brazil-court-reviewing-criminalization-abortion\">Two cases</a> pending before the Supreme Court in Brazil could decriminalize abortion in certain circumstances. One case argues that pregnant women infected with Zika virus should have access to abortion. The other seeks to decriminalize abortion on any grounds through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Human Rights Watch has filed <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/25/amicus-curiae-decriminalization-abortion-context-zika-virus-brazil\">amicus</a> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/25/amicus-curiae-decriminalization-abortion-brazil-12-weeks\">briefs</a> in both cases.</p>\n<p>In late November, Rebeca Mendes Silva Leite, a 30-year-old woman from São Paulo, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/01/no-woman-should-need-beg-abortion\">petitioned Brazil’s Supreme Court</a> for permission to legally terminate an unplanned pregnancy. Justice Rosa Weber denied the request for procedural reasons, but did not rule on its merits. After the decision, Rebeca <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-42292032\">traveled to Colombia</a>, where she had a legal abortion.</p>\n<p>Several other Latin American countries – Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, Haiti, and Honduras – still ban abortion completely. In a 2017 investigation, Human Rights Watch found that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/31/nicaragua-abortion-ban-threatens-health-and-lives\">Nicaragua’s total abortion ban</a> has not stopped abortion, but has made it more unsafe. Research around the world shows that when governments restrict abortion, women still have abortions – they just have more dangerous ones. According to a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/AbortionPoliciesReproductiveHealth.pdf\">UN report</a>, the average unsafe abortion rate was more than four times greater in countries with restrictive abortion policies in 2011 than in countries with liberal abortion policies.</p>\n<p>“The members of the Congressional committee should reject the dangerous abortion ban,” Vivanco said. “Brazilian women and girls desperately need greater access to reproductive choice, not to have what little choice there is available to them whittled away further.”</p>",

The junta also accused Sunisa of committing sedition, alleging that her Facebook posts were not honest criticisms and caused public disaffection with the government.</p>\n<p>The complaint stated that the legal action concerned the following messages on Sunisa’s Facebook page:<br>\n </p>\n<p>-November 22, criticizing the junta for failing to provide credible explanations about the death of an army cadet who allegedly died as a result of corporal punishment at the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School (AFAPS);</p>\n<p>-December 3, criticizing the government’s budget allocation that fails to prioritize the public health service and relies on voluntary donations from the public to fill in missing budgetary support for state hospitals; and</p>\n<p>-December 4, criticizing Prime Minister Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha for welcoming a rock music star to the Government House while harshly treating people who suffered from government policies, such as the dispersal of coal-fired power plant protesters on November 27 in Songkhla province.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nBringing sedition and computer crime charges against a politician for criticism on Facebook shows the Thai junta’s growing contempt for fundamental freedoms. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Brad Adams </h4>\n<p>Asia Director </p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\nGeneral Prayuth’s repeated public promises to restore democratic rule and the government’s recent adoption of a so-called “national human rights agenda” have not eased the Thai military’s repressive rule, Human Rights Watch said. The junta’s record on freedom of expression has been particularly poor because Thai authorities have repeatedly harassed and prosecuted people for their speech, writings, and internet postings critical of military rule.</p>\n<p>The junta has frequently treated people who <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/09/thailand-drop-charges-critical-facebook-posts\">express dissenting views</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/09/thailand-8-charged-mocking-junta-leader-facebook\">mock General Prayuth</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/30/thailand-sedition-charge-red-bowl-photo\">show support for the deposed governments of Thaksin Shinawatra and Yingluck Shinawatra</a> as posing a threat to national security. Since the May 2014 military coup, the authorities have prosecuted at least 40 people under the draconian sedition statute, article 116 of the Criminal Code, which carries up to a seven-year prison sentence.</p>\n<p>The government has also considered posting critical commentary online about the government and military rule as an offense under article 14 of Thailand’s Computer-Related Crime Act (CCA) regarding “distorted” and “false” information, with violators facing up to five years in prison.</p>\n<p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that monitors compliance with the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), which Thailand has ratified, stated in a <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/gc34.pdf\">general comment on freedom of expression</a> in July 2011 that:<br>\n </p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he mere fact that forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify the imposition of penalties. … Moreover, all public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority such as heads of state and government, are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition. Accordingly, the Committee expresses concern regarding laws on such matters as … disrespect for authority, … and the protection of the honor of public officials. [Governments] should not prohibit criticism of institutions, such as the army or the administration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n“Thailand’s generals become more firmly entrenched in power with each passing year at the expense of the Thai people’s rights,” Adams said. “Pressure from concerned governments is needed for the junta to end repression, restore respect for basic rights, and return to democratic civilian rule.”</p>",

Members of Aidar were reportedly responsible for <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/EUR50/040/2014/en/\">arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, and acts of torture</a> during the war. The film doesn’t hide this: it includes footage of Aidar fighters physically and verbally abusing a civilian they suspected of supporting the separatists.</p>\n<p>The screenings were scheduled for December 9 and 10 as part of Artdocfest, a prominent documentary film festival in Moscow. The director, Beata Bubenec, told me that during the December 9 screening, three people approached her and the festival director, Vitaly Mansky, protesting that Aidar fighters had killed and abused pro-Russian civilians and screening a film about them in Russia was inappropriate. They warned a second screening would <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2017/12/10/na-artdokfeste-sorvali-pokaz-filma-o-voyne-na-ukraine-glavnoe\">cause “serious problems.”</a> Bubenec said that the men threatened her, so Mansky asked her not to attend the next day.</p>\n<p>On December 10, when the screening began, several <a href=\"https://zona.media/news/2017/12/10/banderlogi\">people jumped on the stage, screaming the film was “fascist.”</a> Others, some in camouflage, sprayed pungent gas around the room. One person there told me that audience members were tearing up and covering their noses and mouths with scarves and handkerchiefs to protect against the powerful smell. Fearing that the gas could cause respiratory problems, the organizers stopped the screening and ordered an evacuation.</p>\n<p>There were over 50 assailants. The police arrived and led them out of the room, but released most of them in the cinema’s hallway and outside. As a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ekaterina.barabash/posts/10212910992121544\">well-known film critic noted</a>, “[police officers] look calmly at the camouflaged men wreaking havoc.” According to media reports, police eventually detained several particularly aggressive protesters and released them promptly after issuing administrative charge sheets for disobeying police.</p>\n<p>The assailants were mainly from the Russian Liberation Movement South East Radical Bloc (SERB), a small ultra-nationalist group that emerged in 2014 in Ukraine and attempted to take over Kharkiv city’s administration. To avoid prosecution, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/21/violence-name-traditional-values\">some members fled to Russia, where they have attacked several Russian pro-democracy activists and opposition figures</a>, including leading opposition politician <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/06/russia-nationwide-assaults-political-opposition-campaign\">Alexei Navalny and his campaigners</a>. The authorities consistently fail to hold anyone accountable, so it is no surprise that SERB and other radical pseudo-patriotic groups continue these attacks.</p>\n<p>Mansky said that the <a href=\"https://echo.msk.ru/news/2108056-echo.html#onair\">organizers filed a police complaint</a>, and that many audience members expressed their intention to do the same. This brazen attack clearly requires a prompt and effective investigation, and violent ultra-nationalists should be sent a strong message that they do not enjoy impunity.</p>",

The charges were brought after Mirsaidov appealed to Tajikistan’s president to crack down on corruption by local authorities.</p>\n<p>“Khayrullo Mirsaidov, who is well-known and respected for his independent journalism, appears to be the latest victim of the Tajik government’s crackdown on critical voices,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/steve-swerdlow\">Steve Swerdlow</a>, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Tajik government should ensure Mirsaidov’s rights in detention, including to be free from ill treatment and have access to a lawyer, and should move promptly to secure his release.”</p>\n<p>Habibullo Mirsaidov, the journalist’s father, told Radio Ozodi, the Tajik service of Radio Free Europe, that the Sughd region Prosecutor General’s office summoned Mirsaidov for an interrogation on December 5 and arrested him on the spot. Mirsaidov is being held in pretrial detention facility No. 1 in the city of Khujand. A local court approved the prosecutor’s request to detain him for two months.</p>\n<p>In November, Mirsaidov wrote an <a href=\"https://www.news.tj/news/tajikistan/society/20171110/hairullo-mirsaidov-tadzhikskih-kvntshikov-pitayutsya-sdelat-prestupnikami\">open letter</a> to President Emomali Rahmon, Prosecutor General Yusuf Rahmon, and the head of the Sughd region, Abdurakhmon Kodiri, asking them to investigate a corruption episode. His letter detailed alleged attempts by Olim Zohidzoda, head of the Sughd Department of Youth and Sport, to solicit a US$1,000 bribe from the funds Sughd authorities allocated to the local youth satirical comedy troupe – known commonly by its Russian acronym KVN<em> – </em>that Mirsaidov manages. The funds were intended to pay for microphones and other equipment for the team.</p>\n<p>“I complained about these actions to the local government of the Sughd region and left for Moscow with the team,” Mirsaidov wrote.  “However, as soon as I had returned home, tax authorities and the Prosecutor General’s office simultaneously began investigating our team.” In response, Zohidzoda accused Mirsaidov of embezzling the funds.</p>\n<p>The charges against Mirsaidov carry up to a total of 21 years in prison under Tajikistan’s Criminal Code. The incitement charges are allegedly linked to satirical comedy skits by the KVN troupe.</p>\n<p>Over the past 17 years, Mirsaidov has earned a reputation for fearless, independent journalism and solid political analysis. He has reported for <em>Deutsche Welle</em>, <em>Asia-Plus</em>, and the <em>Fergana </em>media outlets, among others. Mirsaidov has often written about human rights issues, ecological problems, and respect for ethnic minorities. He also worked as a media development trainer on projects sponsored by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Department for International Development (DFID), and the Index on Censorship.</p>\n<p>Since 2014, Mirsaidov has managed the Sughd region’s competitive KVN team, leading them to become finalists and win championships in Bishkek, Sochi, and Moscow among hundreds of competing teams. KVN comedy competitions have a long and popular tradition across the former Soviet space and are known for including political satire.</p>\n<p>Tajikistan’s atrocious human rights record worsened further in 2017, as authorities deepened a severe, widespread crackdown on free expression and association, peaceful political opposition activity, the independent legal profession, and the independent exercise of religious faith. Well over 150 political activists, including a number of lawyers, remain unjustly jailed, and relatives of dissidents who peacefully criticize the government from outside the country have been subject to violent retaliation orchestrated by authorities, including arbitrary detention, threats of rape, confiscation of passports and property, and vigilante justice at the hands of sometimes violent mobs.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, at least 20 journalists have fled the country, fearing prosecution for their professional activities. Journalists perceived to be critical of the government risk harassment and intimidation. As a cult of personality around Rahmon has risen, journalists are subjected to ever stricter legal rules on how they refer to him and his family. As of April, a new law mandates that all media must refer to Rahmon as “The Founder of Peace and National Unity, Leader of the Nation, President of the Republic of Tajikistan, His Excellency Emomali Rahmon.”</p>\n<p>“Authorities have presented no credible evidence supporting Mirsaidov’s arrest on what appear to be politically motivated charges,” said Marius Fossum, Norwegian Helsinki Committee regional representative in Central Asia. “Independent journalists like Mirsaidov should be recognized for their important work, not locked away and silenced for daring to discuss corruption.”</p>",

After allegations that results had been manipulated, protests erupted and authorities decreed a state of emergency. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras reported that they received information that as many as 11 people died during the protests.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">“Respect for human rights is central to democracy,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/jose-miguel-vivanco\">José Miguel Vivanco</a>, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “That not only means that all votes should be counted correctly, but also that the Honduran authorities need to guarantee the right to peaceful protest.&quot;</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">The participation of sitting President Juan Orlando Hernández in the elections was controversial, since the Honduran Constitution forbids a second term. However, congressmen from Hernández’ National Party challenged this prohibition before the Supreme Court, claiming, among other issues, that the term limit violated international human rights standards.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">They relied on a provision in the American Convention on Human Rights that says that political rights can “only” be limited under very specific circumstances. It was a far-fetched interpretation, since the clause was designed in 1969 to prevent abusive governments from arbitrarily barring opposition candidates, not to impede constitutional term limits designed to prevent the rise of autocrats, Human Rights Watch said. However, the Supreme Court agreed with them, and Hernández was allowed to run for a second term.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">The day after the election, Honduras’ Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced that with more than half of the votes counted, the opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla, had a five-point lead over Hernández. But final results were delayed and two days later, after a several-hour outage of the tribunal’s computer system, the trend reversed. On December 4, more than a week after the elections, the tribunal announced that Hernández had received 1.6 percent more votes than Nasralla.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nThere are strong indications of election fraud in Honduras, and the claims need to be investigated and the voter’s will respected. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>José Miguel Vivanco</h4>\n<p>Americas director</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">Also on December 4, international observers from the Organization of American States said that they had found such serious “irregularities, mistakes and systemic problems” in the election process that they could not certify its fairness.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">Because of the suspicions of irregularities, Nasralla demanded a recount –  supported by the <a href=\"http://www.oas.org/documents/spa/press/informe-preliminar-moe-honduras-2017-4dic.pdf\">OAS</a> and the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-337507607-708677481/declaraciones-de-la-jefa-de-los-observadores-europeos-al-fin-del-escrutinio\">European Union</a> observation missions. On December 5, Hernández said at a news conference that he would accept a recount and the following day, signed an agreement with the OAS to that end. Nasralla has not agreed. On December 7, he indicated that his party demands a complete recount, conducted by international officials instead of the tribunal. On December 10, the tribunal finalized a partial recount. The issue remains unresolved.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">Protests, some accompanied by reports of looting, erupted throughout the country on November 29, following reports of irregularities in tallying votes. On December 1, authorities established a 10-day state of emergency, ordering a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and authorizing the involvement of the armed forces. The OAS General Secretariat called this suspension of constitutional rights “disproportionate.”</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">On December 4, one special police unit stated that it had refused to break up public demonstrations and announced a strike. On December 6, the curfew was lifted in 8 of Honduras’ 18 regions. In the next days, the curfew was lifted in six other regions. In the areas where it was still in force, it would apply from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">The authorities can and should act to prevent violence and looting, but they need to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly without unnecessary or disproportionate force, Human Rights Watch said.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">“There are strong indications of election fraud in Honduras, and the claims need to be investigated and the voter’s will respected,” Vivanco said. “At the same time, Honduran authorities need to maintain the right to freedom of assembly and refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force.”</div>",

In her deeply moving testimony, she explained how North Korean officials beat her and fed her only rotten food before she finally managed to reach <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/south-korea\">South Korea</a> on her fourth attempt. As she described how she was forced by the <em>bowibu</em> (North Korea's Ministry of State Security) to abort her first child after being captured a third time, and how her little sister was trafficked and sold into slavery after a failed escape attempt, her voice broke and faltered.</p>\n<p>Ms. Ji recounted her horrific ordeal at an event organized by UN Security Council members. The event followed a key debate at the council on North Korea’s human rights record – the fourth time in four years the council has voted, despite objections from <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/china-and-tibet\">China</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia\">Russia</a>, to hold such a debate. Spotlighting North Korea’s appalling human rights record at this apex UN body serves as a reminder that crimes against humanity cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoIDPRK/Report/A.HRC.25.63.doc\">North Korea’s cruelty – described by the UN as, “unparalleled in the modern world,”</a> – sees millions of its people suffer <a href=\"http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/72/394&Lang=E\">grave human rights violations</a> at the hands of their own government, including torture, murder, enslavement, and rape.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, these annual UN discussions are a thorn in China’s side, and compel Beijing to try and defend the indefensible. At the council today, China once again tried to block the meeting by insisting that the human rights situation in North Korea does not pose a threat to international peace and security. But the bulk of the council disagreed.</p>\n<p>China also deserves greater scrutiny for its role in supporting the Kim regime and facilitating North Korea’s egregious abuses. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/03/china-redoubling-crackdowns-fleeing-north-koreans\">China has recently intensified its crackdown on North Korean refugees</a> fleeing through China to find protection in a third country. As Ms. Ji described in stark detail, North Korean refugees have been tortured in Chinese detention, but face even worse treatment upon their forced return to North Korea. China should uphold its legal obligations under the Convention Against Torture and the UN Refugee Convention.</p>\n<p>Some UN member states have already taken action on this: the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/united-states\">United States</a> has sanctioned individual members of the North Korean regime on human rights grounds three times. <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/275123.htm\">Evidence from North Koreans suggests that abuses have sometimes been reduced</a> as a direct consequence of these human rights sanctions. Other states should follow suit.</p>\n<p>The UN Security Council should consider similar measures, but also press for criminal accountability, including before the International Criminal Court, so that victims may one day receive the long overdue justice they deserve.</p>",

International donors, who would be needed to fund the massive repatriation effort, should insist that Burma and Bangladesh invite the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to join in drafting a new tripartite agreement that ensures adherence to international standards.</p>\n<p>\tSince late August 2017, <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/iscg-situation-update-rohingya-refugee-crisis-cox-s-bazar-07-december-2017\">more than 645,000 ethnic Rohingya have fled a campaign of ethnic cleansing</a> by Burma’s security forces and sought asylum in Bangladesh. Human Rights Watch has interviewed more than 200 of the refugees. Many said that they wish to eventually return home, but that they do not believe it is safe to return to Burma for the foreseeable future and until their security, land, and livelihoods can be ensured.</p>\n<p>\t“Burma has yet to end its military abuses against the Rohingya, let alone create conditions that would allow them to return home safely,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/bill-frelick\">Bill Frelick</a>, refugee rights director at Human Rights Watch. “This agreement looks more like a public relations effort by Burma to quickly close this ugly chapter than a serious effort to restore the rights of Rohingya and allow them to voluntarily return in safety and dignity.”</p>\n<p>\t<div>\n<h2>Related Content</h2>\n<span></span>\n<div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/201712letter_myanmar_bangladesh.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download Letter (PDF)</a></li>\n</ul></div> </div>\n\n<p>\tOn November 23, Bangladesh and Burma signed an “Arrangement on Return of Displaced Persons from Rakhine State” on behalf of “residents of Rakhine State” who crossed from Burma into Bangladesh after October 9, 2016 and August 25, 2017. The agreement makes no reference to the cause of most of the forced displacement: a campaign of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/03/burma-military-massacres-dozens-rohingya-village\">killings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/16/burma-widespread-rape-rohingya-women-girls\">widespread rape</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/17/burma-new-satellite-images-confirm-mass-destruction\">mass arson</a> carried out by Burmese security forces that amounted to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/25/burma-military-commits-crimes-against-humanity\">crimes against humanity</a>. The agreement also fails to identify the displaced either as Rohingya or as refugees.</p>\n<p>\tVoluntary repatriation in safety and dignity as required by international law will not be feasible until the Burmese government demonstrates its willingness and ability to ensure full respect for returnees’ human rights, equal access to nationality, and security, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>\tThe agreement expresses Burma’s commitment to “take necessary measures to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh” – which raises grave concerns since everyone has a right to flee persecution in their own country. The agreement also makes no direct reference to nonrefoulement, the principle of international refugee law that prohibits the forcible return of refugees to places where their lives or freedom would be threatened. And the agreement restricts returnees’ freedom of movement to Rakhine State in “conformity with existing laws and regulations,” many of which discriminate against the Rohingya.</p>\n<p>\tSeveral Burmese officials have spoken about putting Rohingya in “camps.” This would be an unacceptable approach to their return as camps set up after previous anti-Rohingya violence have led to de facto detention and segregation.</p>\n<p>\tWhile the agreement says that Bangladesh will immediately seek assistance from UNHCR to carry out safe and voluntary returns, Burma agrees only “that the services of the UNHCR could be drawn upon as needed and at the appropriate time.”</p>\n<p>\t“After the widespread atrocities, safe and voluntary return of Rohingya will require international monitors on the ground in Burma,” Frelick said. “This means a central role for the UNHCR, the only UN agency with a statutory mandate to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees.”</p>\n<p>\tGiven the critical flaws in the agreement, Burma and Bangladesh should invite UNHCR to join in the drafting of a new tripartite agreement, Human Rights Watch said. This should include some existing provisions, such as encouraging refugees “to return voluntarily and safely to their own households and original places of residence or to a safe and secure place nearest to it or their choice.” The current agreement also commits Burma “to see that the returnees will not be settled in temporary places for a long time.”</p>",

The government, which has a parliamentary majority, went ahead without waiting for the advice of the Council of Europe’s legal advisory body, the Venice Commission.</p>\n<p>To makes matters worse, the <a href=\"https://search.coe.int/directorate_of_communications/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=090000168076f3e9\">Venice Commission issued its opinion</a> the very same day of the vote, and concluded that the proposed amendments to the acts on the National Council of the Judiciary and the Supreme Court put at “serious risk” the independence of “all parts” of the Polish judiciary. Its opinion makes clear that the new versions of the draft law, proposed by <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/poland\">Poland</a>’s president, are little better than the initial ones proposed by parliament over the summer which the president vetoed.</p>\n<p>The amendments still need the Senate’s approval, expected this week, before being signed into law by the same president who proposed them. Whether the decision to move on the amendments without the Venice Commission’s opinion was a deliberate act of defiance or just a bizarre coincidence, the Polish government can still do the right thing and halt their adoption. If it ignores the warning issued by the Venice Commission this will only confirm that the Polish government has no interest in dialogue or cooperation with European institutions on matters pertaining to rule of law and human rights.</p>\n<p>This is just the latest in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/24/poland-dismantling-rights-protection\">two-year authoritarian slide by the ruling Law and Justice party</a>, which since coming to office has systematically eroded checks and balances and undermined human rights while ignoring pleas from the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union\">European Union</a> and Council of Europe to change course.</p>\n<p>Both the <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/political/138618\">EU Commission</a> and the <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/tickers/139888\">European Parliament</a> have flagged that they are ready to move from failed dialogue to action, and trigger Article 7 of the EU treaty against Poland, which could lead to the suspension of Poland’s EU voting rights.</p>\n<p>If this latest blow to rule of law in Poland isn’t blocked by the Senate or the President, EU institutions should make good on their words and trigger Article 7 action against Poland.</p>",

And drones allow us to collect images and live video remotely at a level of detail impossible with even the most advanced satellite technology.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, drones offer an alternative to field research that can be significantly safer and more secure, for example, when physical access is restricted or denied.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the use of drones in human rights investigations presents a range of legal, security, and privacy issues that require special consideration, especially in insecure environments where the possession or use of such technology could endanger ourselves and others.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, Human Rights Watch conducts a rigorous review before any drone flight. As we and others deploy new technologies, documenting abuses cannot come at the expense of ethical and professional norms.</p>",

At the time of his arrest, Hamouri had been preparing to visit his wife and toddler son in Paris. The family had been forced to live separately ever since Israeli authorities deported Hamouri’s wife, a French national, last year citing “security reasons.” Hamouri never did make his family reunion, and has been detained since without charge or trial based on secret evidence. In September, an Israeli court confirmed a military administrative order to detain him for six months, and that can be renewed.</p>\n<p>This isn’t Hamouri’s first time in Israeli detention – authorities imprisoned him between 2005 and 2011. After about three years in pretrial detention, an Israeli military court sentenced him to seven years in prison for charges related to an alleged plot to kill Israel’s former chief rabbi. <a href=\"https://blog.mondediplo.net/2011-04-25-Salah-Hamouri-fragile-conversion-francaise\">In 2011, then French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé expressed regret that the case against Hamouri lacked strong evidentiary support</a>. Human Rights Watch has documented how <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/nearly-100-of-all-military-court-cases-in-west-bank-end-in-conviction-haaretz-learns-1.398369\">military trials by the Israeli army, which have a near 100-percent conviction rate</a>, fall <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/09/08/israel-activist-convicted-after-unfair-trial\">well short of any standards of justice</a>. He was subsequently released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange deal.</p>\n<p>Hamouri’s current case is hardly unique – Israeli authorities are also holding Addameer board member Khalida Jarrar and 451 others in administrative detention as of November 1, according to Israel Prison Service figures. While international humanitarian law permits administrative detention in temporary and exceptional circumstances, Israel’s expansive use of administrative detention in year 51 of its occupation raises questions about its legality.</p>\n<p>In October, the French Foreign Ministry called for Hamouri’s rights to “be respected” and expressed hope for his release, saying that, “the systematic and abusive use of administrative detention undermines the right to fair trial and the right to a defense.” Macron should use his bilateral meeting with Netanyahu to call for Hamouri to be either charged or released promptly. Macron should also press his Israeli counterpart to end <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/04/israel-50-years-occupation-abuses\">Israel’s other systematic abuses of Palestinian rights</a>.</p>",

The administration has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/23/trump-administration-withdraws-transgender-student-protections\">withdrawn guidance protecting transgender youth in schools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/26/president-trumps-despicable-move-bar-transgender-people-military-service\">banned transgender people from serving in the military</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/13/us-justice-department-looks-curtail-lgbt-protections\">undermined LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination protections</a> in federal court, and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/sessions-issues-justice-department-directive-religious-objections-undercutting-lgbtq-protections\">sided with people and organizations who want to discriminate against LGBT people for religious reasons</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2018, another crucial protection is at risk of being erased. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), designed to support survivors of intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and stalking, contains <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/ovw/blog/vawa-2013-nondiscrimination-provision-making-programs-accessible-all-victims-domestic\">important provisions prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people</a> in the services it funds and supports. The protections were added when the law was reauthorized in 2013, making it the first federal law to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. With these provisions, VAWA has helped ensure that all survivors are able to better access care.</p>\n<p>Support for LGBT people who have survived abuse is critical. A <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-and-Sexual-Abuse-among-LGBT-People.pdf\">2015 survey of research by the Williams Institute</a> noted that most studies “found a lifetime prevalence of [intimate partner violence] among lesbian and bisexual women, gay and bisexual men, and transgender people that is as high as or higher than the U.S. general population.” LGBT survivors face <a href=\"http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NCAVP-IPV-Report-2016.pdf\">unique barriers</a> to accessing services, ranging from a lack of awareness to heteronormative assumptions that they don’t need protection from abuse to overt discrimination and exclusion by service providers.</p>\n<p>VAWA helps<a href=\"http://www.nclrights.org/violence-against-women-act-at-20/\"> address these barriers</a>. LGBT-inclusive provisions have encouraged providers to undergo training and ensure services are accessible and effective for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities. They have named LGBT people an underserved population, allowing providers to use earmarked funds to address their unique vulnerabilities. And they have ensured that transgender people are able to access shelters consistent with their gender identity.</p>\n<p>These 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence are the last before Congress is scheduled to reauthorize VAWA. In 2013, Republican leadership in the House of Representatives <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/22/vawa-2013_n_2742096.html\">fought hard to strip LGBT protections</a> from the bill, delaying VAWA reauthorization for months. Advocates have expressed concern that inclusive provisions of the law will come under renewed threat in the upcoming reauthorization. In 2018, Congress should refuse to make the elimination of intimate partner violence for LGBT people a partisan issue. Instead, it should reauthorize an inclusive VAWA that commits to addressing gender-based violence in all its forms. </p>",

While visiting the prison, in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco, I saw cell keys in the hands of inmates chosen by prison authorities, while guards only patrolled external areas. I interviewed two men who had suffered gang rapes that were never investigated, let alone punished.</p>\n<p>I could not imagine things could get much worse than that.</p>\n<p>But they have.</p>\n<p>On December 8th, the federal government published the first updated prison data in more than 18 months. The new data shows that the number of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/americas/brazil\">Brazil</a>’s detainees leapt 17 percent to 726,700 in June 2016 from December 2014. At the same time, prison capacity actually decreased.</p>\n<p>In June 2016, facilities were wildly overcrowded at 197 percent capacity – meaning there were two detainees per space available. In December 2014, facilities were at 167 percent capacity. Crowding in June 2016 was even worse in the states of Pernambuco and Ceará, where there were three detainees per available space, while in Amazonas there were almost five.</p>\n<p>Jamming so many people into cells facilitates the spread of disease and makes it impossible for prison authorities to maintain control within prisons. It is a godsend for criminal gangs, which offer detainees “protection” when prison authorities do not.</p>\n<p>Forty percent of people incarcerated in June 2016 were awaiting trial, and many have languished in detention for a shockingly long time. One of them was a 37-year-old woman I met in the civil police station in Amarante do Maranhão last month. She had been awaiting trial in her cell for two-and-a-half years, and had seen a judge only once. She could step out of her cell only three times a week, to a tiny patio, at the other side of which were the men’s cells.</p>\n<p>Incarcerating more and more people, often in conditions that violate the most basic human rights and where they are at risk of recruitment by gangs, is not a fair or smart policy.</p>\n<p>Authorities should expand so-called custody hearings, which allow detainees to see a judge promptly after arrest, make wider use of alternatives to prison, and increase the number of public defenders.</p>\n<p>Brazil should also abandon its retrograde “war on drugs” policy, which fills prisons with people detained with small quantities of drugs. </p>",

Police also detained Kucherenko’s adult daughter, Valeria, but later released her. Turkmenistan’s international partners should urgently and publicly call on the Turkmen government to disclose Kucherenko’s whereabouts and release her immediately.</p>\n<p>On December 7 at about 11:30 a.m., police broke into Kucherenko’s apartment in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan’s capital, taking the apartment’s metal door off its hinges, and detained Kucherenko and her daughter. At one point the police dragged Kucherenko across the floor. The officers said they were responding to a complaint allegedly filed by neighbors about their pets.</p>\n<p>Valeria Kucherenko has asked the police about her mother’s whereabouts, but they gave varying answers. Kucherenko remains forcibly disappeared as long as authorities fail to disclose her whereabouts.</p>\n<p>“The detention of Kucherenko and her daughter is a stark reminder of the threat that people in Turkmenistan face if they criticize the government,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/rachel-denber\">Rachel Denber</a>, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Turkmen government tolerates no criticism, not even on the treatment of stray animals.”</p>\n<p>Kucherenko, 52, is an animal rights activist who has openly criticized the round-up of stray animals and animal cruelty in Turkmenistan, including on the Russian-language social media site Odnaklassniki.ru.</p>\n<p>Kucherenko’s daughter told Human Rights Watch that police took her to several police stations and promised her that they would allow her to see her mother. However, when police released her at about 5:15 p.m., they refused to provide any information on her mother’s whereabouts. Before they released her, police required her to sign an explanatory statement and pay a 50 manat (about US$14) fine for resisting police.</p>\n<p>An officer at the Ashgabat police station where Valeria Kucherenko had been detained told a Human Rights Watch researcher by phone that Galina Kucherenko had been taken to court but did not provide details on when she would appear before the court, what charges she would face, and where she would be taken after her court appearance. When she spoke with Human Rights Watch, Valeria Kucherenko had not been able to get to the court to try to determine whether the officer gave her accurate information.</p>\n<p>She said that when she returned to the apartment after she was released, all of their pets – 27 cats and one dog – were gone. The apartment appeared to have been ransacked – pillows and pots were scattered and food had been spilled onto the floor. Police had put the door to the apartment back on its hinges, but the lock was broken and she was unable to properly secure the apartment.</p>\n<p>The Kucherenkos’ detention took place two days after a December 5 meeting in Ashgabat of the Joint Committee within the framework of the European Union-Turkmenistan Interim Trade Agreement, a high-level meeting between EU and Turkmen Foreign Affairs Ministry officials. The annual meeting covers political and economic developments and key aspects of EU development cooperation programs.</p>\n<p>The Kucherenkos’ detention also comes amid a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/06/turkmenistan-attack-activists-mother\">spate of threats and attacks on the handful of activists and journalists who remain in Turkmenistan</a>, including Kucherenko and Soltan Achilova, an independent journalist. Turkmen authorities have repeatedly harassed and intimidated Kucherenko in recent months. On November 15, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/21/turkmenistan-activists-threatened\">unidentified men knocked on Kucherenko’s door demanding that she sign a police summons</a> and remained there for about 25 minutes. Just 15 minutes earlier, a police official called her and told her that she must report to the police station in relation to a complaint allegedly filed against her by another activist.</p>\n<p>In November, after repeated unexplained internet outages at her home, Kucherenko learned that her Internet Protocol address had been blocked, meaning she could not access the internet. Representatives of the Ashgabat City Telephone Network told her that her internet access would not be restored.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/denberr/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/U64KDHOA/which%20Turkmenistan%20hosted%20in%20September\">which Turkmenistan hosted in September</a>, police warned Kucherenko that she could face 25 years in prison, without specifying for what. Kucherenko told Human Rights Watch that security agents in civilian clothes persistently conduct surveillance on her.</p>\n<p>“Turkmenistan’s international partners, including the EU, should act swiftly and publicly call on the Turkmen authorities to immediately release Kucherenko,” Denber said. “The Turkmen government needs to immediately cease arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances of its citizens and unconditionally restore freedom of expression.” </p>\n</div>",

Yet his assertion that the Philippine government has been willing and able to investigate those deaths has simply not been true. The government has made no genuine efforts to seek <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/03/02/license-kill/philippine-police-killings-dutertes-war-drugs#7d2a9a\">accountability</a> for drug war abuses. There have been no successful prosecutions or convictions of police <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/13/philippines-abusive-drug-war-breeds-injustice\">implicated in summary killings</a> despite <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/02/philippines-police-deceit-drug-war-killings\">compelling evidence</a> of such abuses. Duterte has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/13/philippines-abusive-drug-war-breeds-injustice\">publicly vowed</a> to pardon, reinstate, and promote officers convicted of extrajudicial killings. Duterte and his supporters have <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/18/duterte-expands-drug-war-war-accountability\">systematically</a> vilified, harassed, and sought to intimidate institutions and individuals – including UN <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/173854-philippines-complains-un-agency-callamard\" target=\"_blank\">officials</a> – who have sought accountability for the killings.</p>\n<p>The government’s claims of its preparedness to prosecute offenders is grotesquely deceptive in the face of this grim reality. It is not known if and when the ICC will act in the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/philippines\">Philippines</a>. In the meantime, a UN-led international probe of drug war killings could help expose the extent of the abuses and possible targets of a criminal investigation, including possible crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>Duterte’s thousands of victims deserve more than empty platitudes in diplomatic circles. They deserve justice. </p>",

But the bill does nothing to increase the transparency of the military operations or accountability for military personnel who commit abuses. The Senate could vote on the bill as early as this week.</p>\n<p>“Mexico has relied heavily on its armed forces to fight organized crime for more than a decade, and the results have been disastrous,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/daniel-wilkinson\">Daniel Wilkinson</a>, Americas managing director at Human Rights Watch. “The country desperately needs to improve its law enforcement capabilities, but turning the job over to a military with a terrible human rights record is not the answer.”</p>\n<p>Between 2006 and 2016, Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission received almost 10,000 complaints of abuse by the military—including more than 2,000 during the current administration. Human Rights Watch and other rights advocates have also documented numerous cases in which military personal ostensibly involved in law enforcement activities were implicated in extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and sexual violence. Impunity remains the norm for these abuses. </p>\n<p>Since Mexico launched its “war on drugs” in 2006—with major deployments of the armed forces to fight organized crime—more than 100,000 people have been killed and more than 30,000 have gone missing. Homicide rates dropped in 2014 and 2015, but have climbed steadily since, with 2017 on track to be the deadliest year in Mexico in two decades.</p>\n<p>The proposed law grants the Mexican military broad authority to engage in “internal security,” including in gathering intelligence “by any legal means possible.” The National Human Rights Commission has said that the law’s vague definitions and lack of objective criteria for what constitutes “internal security” mean that the law can apply to “any” situation. For example, the military would be authorized to engage in crime prevention and investigation. </p>\n<p>The proposed law does not include measures to strengthen civilian police institutions, nor an exit strategy for ending the use of the armed forces in law enforcement. The law also includes no measures to ensure independent civilian control and oversight of military operations, or to ensure that civilian authorities properly investigate and prosecute military abuses.</p>\n<p>“There needs to be a much more serious debate about security issues in Mexico,” Wilkinson said.  “It’s remarkable that after more than 10 years of terrible and tragic results, the Mexican Congress wants to double down on a militarized law enforcement strategy that has proven to be such a costly failure.”</p>",

This attack follows the October 20 destruction of Sidi Abu Gharara, another historic Sufi mosque in Tripoli. Sufism is a form of mysticism that some Muslims follow. Some other Muslims condemn Sufism, and the veneration of the tombs of Sufi spiritual leaders as heterodox.</p>\n<p>\t“Successive interim authorities since the 2011 uprising and across Libya have failed to protect Libya’s Sufi religious sites from attacks and destruction by extremist militias,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/eric-goldstein\">Eric Goldstein</a>, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The unpunished attacks on Sufi mosques are endangering one of Libya’s historic minority communities.”</p>\n<p>\tSince 2011, armed groups across Libya, motivated by religious ideology, have attacked and destroyed dozens of Sufi religious sites, including mosques, shrines, tombs, and libraries containing ancient scriptures. Armed groups have kidnapped and killed Sufi adherents, including sheikhs, with impunity. The November 28 attack came on the eve of the feast marking the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n<p>\tThe October attack on the Sufi mosque in al-Ghararat neighborhood took place during several days of clashes between the Special Deterrence Force (SDF), which is linked to the Interior Ministry for the internationally recognized Government of National Accord, and local armed groups that the SDF accused of drug-trafficking. A religious scholar with ties to the Sufi community in Tripoli said it was the SDF, which had gained control of the neighborhood, that intentionally damaged the 16<sup>th</sup>-century Sidi Abu Gharara Sufi mosque. On October 20, the SDF issued a <a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Falwasat.ly%2Far%2Fmobile%2Farticle%3Farticleid%3D156457&data=02%7C01%7Csalahh%40hrw.org%7Cae9a585bfe83412bb35908d532cd04db%7C2eb79de4d8044273a6e64b3188855f66%7C1%7C0%7C636470778486191352&sdata=VsYG1wa1jNpSL29TT8rFHfNT8mwg6q4k9eoLaX1YnYI%3D&reserved=0\">statement denying responsibility</a> and pledging to hold those responsible to account.</p>\n<p>\tWhile the SDF has denied responsibility, neither of the two governments vying for legitimacy, territorial control, and international support, has condemned recent attacks against Sufi sites, nor moved resolutely to stop them. Previous interim authorities were equally dismissive of these attacks, and at the height of them in 2012 the interior minister at the time <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-minister/libya-will-not-risk-clash-with-shrine-attackers-minister-idUSBRE87R0WQ20120828\">refused to intervene</a> under the pretext of not wanting “to kill people over a grave.”</p>\n<p>\tIn September, the family of Abdelmatloub al-Sarhani, a Sufi civil activist from Benghazi, said in a news interview that unidentified forces in eastern Libya had kidnapped al-Sarhani due to his religious beliefs. He remains missing. According to the news site <em>Al Wasat</em>, 21 followers of Sufism, including al-Sarhani, <a href=\"http://www.alwasat.ly/ar/mobile/article?articleid=153773\">were kidnapped</a> by unidentified forces in eastern Libya between August 1 and 27. Human Rights Watch was unable to verify the names or the number of those kidnapped.</p>\n<p>\tThe same Sufi-affiliated religious scholar, who met with Human Rights Watch in Tripoli on October 28, said attacks against Sufis and Sufi sites have become widespread, particularly since 2012, resulting in fear and intimidation among the Sufi community and leading some to leave Libya for fear of persecution.</p>\n<p>\tThe <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/31/libya-stop-attacks-sufi-sites\">attacks on Sufi sites</a> began in October 2011 with the destruction of the al-Masry shrine in Tripoli, and continued the next month with an attack on the Girgaresh cemetery in Tripoli, destroying tombstones, and damage to the Sidi Nasr shrine also in Tripoli.<br>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nThe unpunished attacks on Sufi mosques are endangering one of Libya’s historic minority communities. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Eric Goldstein</h4>\n<p>Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\nIn January 2012, an armed group <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/31/libya-stop-attacks-sufi-sites\">damaged the Sidi Obeid cemetery</a> and the tomb of Sidi Obeid, a figure revered by Sufis, both in Benghazi. In July 2012, assailants detonated an explosive device at the Sahaba Mosque in the eastern city of Derna, which resulted in damage to the mosque. On August 24, 2012, unidentified assailants attacked the Sidi Abdul-Salam al-Asmar al-Fituri mosque in Zliten, inflicting heavy damage and destroying 700-year-old texts. The shrine of Sidi Ahmed Zaroug in Misrata was also destroyed in August 2012.</p>\n<p>\tOn August 25, 2012, an armed group attacked the Sidi Sha’ab mosque in the center of Tripoli in the presence of law enforcement units from the now-dissolved Supreme Security Committee, which at the time reported to the Interior Ministry. Using bulldozers, the attackers destroyed parts of the mosque and some of the tombstones inside. On August 28, 2012, armed assailants used bulldozers to damage extensively the Uthman Basha mosque in Tripoli’s old town. The attack destroyed 30 graves within the compound. The historic site, which serves as a school of religious learning, also includes a library that was looted and damaged.</p>\n<p>\tAs a result of armed conflicts in both eastern and western Libya, central authority collapsed, and three competing governments emerged, now reduced to two. These are the Interim Government based in the eastern city of al-Bayda, which is aligned with the Libyan National Army and supported by the House of Representatives, and the United Nations-backed, Tripoli-based Government of National Accord. Key institutions, most notably law enforcement and the judiciary, are dysfunctional in most parts of the country, and basic services have collapsed. Armed groups with a Salafist ideology have spread in Libya and are notably part of both forces in east and west.</p>\n<p>\tOther religious monitories in Libya remain at risk from attacks.</p>\n<p>\tIn July 2017, the Supreme Fatwa Committee under the General Authority for Endowments and Islamic Affairs, the religious authority of the Interim Government, issued a <a href=\"https://www.aifta.net/archives/421\">religious edict or fatwa</a> stating that ‘Ibadis, a minority sect of Islam, were “a misguided and aberrant group. They are Kharijites with secret beliefs and infidels without dignity.” <em>Kharijites</em> is used to describe Muslims who rebelled against the Caliphate in the early ages of Islam.</p>\n<p>\tIn February 2015, an armed group that pledged allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), executed 21 people, most of them Egyptian Coptic Christians held captive by the group because of their religion.</p>\n<p>\tThe UN special mandate holders for freedom of religion, cultural rights and minority issues in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DestructionShrines.aspx\">condemned the destruction of Sufi religious and historic sites</a> in Libya.</p>\n<p>\tThe director-general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Irina Bokova, also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/25/us-libya-islamists-idUSBRE87O04E20120825\" target=\"_blank\">voiced her deep concern</a> in 2012 about attacks against places “of religious and cultural significance.”</p>\n<p>\tAs a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Libya is obligated to ensure the freedom of everyone, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to practice their religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching. Authorities are under a specific duty under this treaty to ensure that members of religious minorities can profess their religion in public in community with others. This means that all places of worship and religious importance should be protected when under threat.</p>",

The joint project will monitor the worst violence in North and South Kivu provinces through maps, graphs, and analytical reports.</p>\n<p>According to initial results from the Tracker, from June to November 2017, at least 526 civilians were killed in the Kivus, at least 1,087 people were abducted or kidnapped for ransom, and there were at least 7 incidents of mass rape.</p>\n<p>“As civilians suffer alarming attacks in eastern Congo, the Kivu Security Tracker will provide policy makers, journalists, activists, and others with an innovative new tool to better understand the violence,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/ida-sawyer\">Ida Sawyer</a>, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “We hope the Tracker will be used to more effectively address the root causes of Congo’s conflict, support communities affected, and hold those responsible to account.”</p>\n<p>\n<div>\n<article data-eq-pts=\"large: 728\">\n<span></span>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://kivusecurity.org\">\n<img width=\"832\" alt=\"Kivu Security Tracker\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/16x9/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712africa_drc_kstlogo.png?itok=GHDHFRHv\" height=\"468\">\n</a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<h2> <a href=\"https://kivusecurity.org\">\nKivu Security Tracker </a>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://kivusecurity.org\">Click here to explore the Tracker!</a> </div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n\n<p>Since the Tracker began documenting incidents in June, a team of 14 Congolese researchers based across North and South Kivu have spoken daily with victims of abuses and their families, witnesses, customary chiefs, clergy, activists, and government officials to document abuses and seek to identify the armed actors responsible. Project staff in Congo and abroad then verify their reports with reliable sources before publishing incidents on the website, providing comprehensive and timely accounts that are updated as additional information becomes available.</p>\n<p>The Tracker records violent incidents by armed groups and members of the Congolese security forces, both in armed conflict and political violence. The data set includes violent deaths, clashes between armed groups, abductions, kidnappings, mass rapes (with at least five victims in a single attack), property destruction, and the repression of peaceful political demonstrations. Nearly 800 incidents were logged during the first six months of reporting.</p>\n<p>The Tracker is intended to promote greater understanding of events in a country facing increased violence. Last year, 922,000 people were displaced in Congo, more than anywhere else in the world. In October, the United Nations declared a “<a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies\">Level 3 emergency</a>” in Congo, a category only given to three other countries: Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. The Congolese conflict, however, is marked by enormous complexity – the Tracker maps areas of control for 120 armed groups in just two of the country’s 26 provinces. This has made it difficult for policymakers to devise solutions and for media to tell the story behind the violence, the organizations said.</p>\n<p>The Tracker helps address this challenge. By highlighting patterns and trends, and through a graphic representation of the violence, it aims to make the conflict more comprehensible. The initial findings indicate that much of the violence in the Kivus goes unreported. Ninety percent of the incidents documented on the Tracker, amounting to 70 percent of violent deaths, were not mentioned at all in international media. More than half are absent from the <a href=\"https://www.acleddata.com/data/\">best available academic trackers of violence</a>.</p>\n<p>While many factors contribute to the violence, some trends stand out. Congolese security forces were responsible for over 100 violent deaths over the past six months, more than any single armed group and roughly one fifth of total killings documented. One of the worst single incidents documented was a massacre of at least 39 Burundian refugees by Congolese security forces in Kamanyola, South Kivu, on September 15.</p>\n<p>The Tracker’s findings also suggest that the conflict in eastern Congo has been exacerbated by the country’s general political <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/blog-feed/democratic-republic-congo-crisis\">crisis</a>, as President Joseph Kabila has delayed elections and used <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/04/dr-congo-rebels-were-recruited-crush-protests\">violence, repression</a>, and <a href=\"https://allthewealth.congoresearchgroup.org/\">corruption</a> to entrench his hold on power beyond the end of his constitutionally mandated two-term limit, which ended on December 19, 2016. Armed groups have formed coalitions to challenge Kabila’s extended presidency, while the government has cracked down violently on peaceful protesters.</p>\n<p>“Levels of displacement in Congo today are higher than ever recorded,” said <a href=\"http://cic.nyu.edu/people/jason-stearns\">Jason Stearns</a>, director of the Congo Research Group. “The current political crisis is not just a question of elections, but it’s about the millions affected by persistent and deadly violence. Solving the crisis will require nuanced engagement in the conflict, but also the political will to challenge those responsible.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>(Brussels, December 7, 2017) – The <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/human-rights-european-union\">European Union</a> is taking important steps to ensure that EU-funded humanitarian assistance reaches people with disabilities, the European Disability Forum, Human Rights Watch, and the Norwegian Refugee Council said today. People with disabilities in humanitarian crises face massive problems in getting even basic services such as food, water, sanitation, shelter, education, and safety protection.</p>\n<p>At the 4th European Parliament of Persons with Disabilities on December 6, 2017, Christos Stylianides, the European commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, announced a number of measures that would considerably improve access to humanitarian aid worldwide for people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\n“Aid actors sometimes consult organizations of persons with disabilities, but may not consider that we can also help directly in humanitarian operations. After all, we know what it means to live with a disability and what we need. This must change. Nothing about us without us.” </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Yannis Vardakastanis</h4>\n<p>European Disability Forum President</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\nPeople with disabilities are among the most at-risk groups in humanitarian situations. Yet, they are also among the most overlooked, in part due to insufficient knowledge about including people with disabilities and a lack of clear standards on how to carry out inclusive humanitarian action.</p>\n<p>“Aid actors sometimes consult organizations of persons with disabilities, but may not consider that we can also help directly in humanitarian operations,” said Yannis Vardakastanis, president of the European Disability Forum. “After all, we know what it means to live with a disability and what we need. This must change. Nothing about us without us.”</p>\n<p>Fifteen percent of the world’s population – or one in seven people – has a disability. This figure is likely to be even higher in emergency situations because of conflict or disaster-related injuries and lack of health care and other services.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/31/south-sudan-people-disabilities-older-people-face-danger\">South Sudan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/18/greece-refugees-disabilities-overlooked-underserved\">Greece</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/21/central-african-republic-people-disabilities-high-risk\">Central African Republic</a>, Human Rights Watch has documented that people with disabilities face neglect, abandonment, and barriers to basic services in refugee and displacement camps. One man with a physical disability in a camp for internally displaced persons in Central African Republic said he needed to crawl into the latrines: “I have to walk with my hands and I don’t have gloves. I must wrap my hands in tissue if I can find it. Most of the time I can’t find it. Honestly it makes me pity myself.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/migration-refugees-disabilities\">Research conducted by the European Disability Forum among refugees in Greece</a> also found a lack of access to services, including medical care, and insufficient access to assistive technology. EDF’s national member, the National Council of Persons with Disabilities, is now directly involved in providing support to refugees with disabilities and their families, in cooperation with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.</p>\n<p>Stylianides <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/news/eu-announces-new-measures-support-people-disabilities-crises_en\">announced</a> that starting in 2018, requests for proposals from the European Commission’s humanitarian agency (ECHO), which funds the operations of humanitarian organizations on the ground, will highlight that applicants must include people with disabilities in their actions. In addition, ECHO will develop standards for addressing the needs of people with disabilities in all EU-funded projects.</p>\n<p>Stylianides also promised to consult people with disabilities and their representative organizations in designing and carrying out these initiatives, in line with the principle of “Nothing about us without us.”</p>\n<p>“This is a real turning point in global efforts to ‘leave no one behind,’” said <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/about/people/shantha-rau-barriga\">Shantha Rau Barriga</a>, disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “If the EU makes these changes, it could improve the lives of millions of people with disabilities who need aid in emergency situations around the world.”</p>\n<p>The EU has a clear responsibility to include people with disabilities in the humanitarian operations it funds, the groups said. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified by the European Union, requires the EU to ensure the protection and safety of people with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies without discrimination. In addition, the EU has endorsed the <a href=\"http://humanitariandisabilitycharter.org/\">Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action</a>, making a commitment to eliminate discrimination against people with disabilities in aid programming and policy, and to ensure that people with disabilities have access to aid and services.</p>\n<p>To bring the voices of refugees with disabilities to policymakers in the EU, the European Disability Forum, Human Rights Watch, and the Disability Intergroup of the European Parliament organized a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/27/eu-ensure-aid-reaches-refugees-disabilities\">roundtable panel</a> in the European Parliament in March. At the event, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/video/2017/06/01/nujeen-eu-refugees-disabilities-deserve-better\">Nujeen Mustafa</a>, a young refugee with a disability from Syria, addressed Commissioner Stylianides: “It’s kind of a sad fact that in the 21st century, toilets and basic services are considered a luxury for some people. All of us, and especially people with disabilities, deserve much better.”</p>\n<p>While governments, donors, and aid agencies are overwhelmed with many competing priorities during emergencies, the needs and concerns of people with disabilities can and should be addressed right from the planning stage, the European Disability Forum, Human Rights Watch, and the Norwegian Refugee Council said. This should include making sure that aid workers, peacekeepers, and local and national authorities are sensitive to the rights and needs for protection of people with disabilities and strengthening the workers’ capacity and skills to identify and include people with disabilities in systems both for preparedness and response to emergency situations.</p>\n<p>“As one of the world’s largest humanitarian donors, the European Union has tremendous potential to press its implementing partners to include people with disabilities in their activities and become a leader on the inclusion of people with disabilities in the humanitarian space,” said Edouard Rodier, Europe director of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “We call on all donor agencies to follow ECHO’s example and make sure that the needs of people with disabilities in crisis situations are no longer overlooked.”</p>",

On December 4, 2017 the court ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. </p>\n</span>\n<span>©2016 Reuters</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>(Amsterdam, December 6, 2017) – The <a href=\"https://www.vfgh.gv.at/medien/Ehe_fuer_gleichgeschlechtliche_Paare.de.php\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian Constitutional Court’s ruling</a> on December 4, 2017, that a ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional is a powerful victory for equal marriage rights, Human Rights Watch said today. It is the first time a Constitutional Court in Europe has held that the exclusion of gay people from civil marriage is unconstitutional. The Austrian government and parliament should quickly adopt marriage equality legislation.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that the law on civil marriage, which limits civil marriage to a union between a woman and a man, violates the prohibition against discrimination in the Austrian constitution. The court explicitly stated that a ban on same-sex marriage conveys the message that lesbian, gay, or bisexual people are not equal to heterosexuals and concluded that this amounts to discrimination.</p>\n<p>“The judges ruled that banning same-sex couples from civil marriage is a violation of the fundamental principle that people are entitled to be treated equally, and that the state is not allowed to discriminate against people based on their personal characteristics,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/boris-dittrich\" target=\"_blank\">Boris Dittrich</a>, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Gay, lesbian, and bisexual Austrians have been waiting for a long time for marriage equality, and now is the time for parliament to deliver with marriage equality legislation.”</p>\n<p>The court gave the government and parliament until January 1, 2019, to agree on legislation allowing same-sex couples to enter civil marriage. If the government does not act by then, the civil marriage law will become unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The case was brought by two women who have a registered partnership but wanted to get married. A magistrate in Vienna denied them their marriage license, as did the Vienna administrative court.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Austria adopted a law on registered partnership, applicable only to same-sex couples. The idea behind the law was to minimize discrimination against same-sex couples, while continuing to restrict civil marriage to different-sex couples.</p>\n<p>In the December 4 ruling, the Constitutional Court argued that over the course of time, the differences between civil marriage and registered partnership have diminished. For example, since 2016 same-sex couples have been allowed to adopt children, and all couples have equal access to medically assisted reproduction.</p>\n<p>The court also concluded that the law on registered partnership, which allows only same-sex couples to register their relationship, discriminates against different-sex couples. Therefore, in the absence of any action by the government and parliament, as of January 1, 2019, registered partnerships will also be opened to different-sex couples.</p>\n<p>Twenty-four countries already have marriage equality. It is expected that Australia will follow very soon, after its Senate voted in favour of such legislation in November. The Australian House of Representatives is discussing the legislation this week. In other countries, including Chile and Taiwan, such legislation is being drafted.</p>\n<p>Many western European countries have introduced marriage equality. The Netherlands was the first in the world, with an equal marriage law that came into force in 2001. This year, Germany and Malta joined the group of European countries in which all couples wishing to legally marry are treated equally.</p>\n<p>Constitutional courts in South Africa, Colombia, and Taiwan have also ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage in unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>“Austria’s constitutional court has sent a powerful message that when it comes to the legal status of relationships, separate is not equal,” Dittrich said. “This could provide incentives for same-sex couples in other countries to turn to their courts to claim equal marriage rights.”</p>\n</div>",

His vacant seat in the general assembly of the parliament was marked with his photo </p>\n</span>\n<span>© 2016 HDP</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">(Istanbul) – The prolonged pretrial detention of the leader of a parliamentary opposition party in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/turkey\">Turkey</a> challenges basic democratic principles and is part of a wider pattern of repression against government critics, Human Rights Watch said today.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The trial of Selahattin Demirtaş, leader of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) is scheduled to begin in the Sincan prison campus courthouse in Ankara on December 7, 2017, 11 months after he was indicted. Demirtaş has been in pretrial detention since November 2016. The HDP, known as a pro-Kurdish party, is the second-largest opposition party in the parliament.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">“Holding the leader of a major opposition party in pretrial detention for over a year on flimsy charges is another example of the political abuse of the criminal justice system we are repeatedly seeing in Turkey,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/hugh-williamson\">Hugh Williamson</a>, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Keeping Demirtaş in jail for months on end not only denies his right to political association, participation, and freedom of expression, but it disenfranchises those who voted for him and his party.”</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The 500-page indictment against Demirtaş accuses him of being a leading member of the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK/KCK), of spreading terrorist propaganda, and of praising crimes and criminals. It accuses him of inciting enmity among the population and inciting the population not to obey laws and to commit crimes, and of organizing, participating in, and provoking unauthorized demonstrations. The charges came eight months after a May 2016 decision to strip him and other members of parliament from his party of their immunity from prosecution. If convicted, he could face a 142-year prison sentence.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\">The evidence cited against Demirtaş relies heavily on his speeches. In addition, many pages of transcripts of wiretapped calls and intercepted conversations are used as evidence to suggest Demirtaş’s association with a nongovernmental group in Diyarbakır, in Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish region, called the Democratic Society Congress (DTK). The prosecutor alleges that the group is part of the PKK/KCK, though none of the information seems to point to anything approaching criminal activity.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">The evidence also includes a public statement by the HDP on October 6, 2014, calling for protests against the Turkish government’s approach to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) assault on the northern Syrian town of Kobane. The prosecutor describes this statement as incitement to armed insurrection, although the statement did not call for violent protest. The indictment lists in detail the consequences of these protests, which resulted in up to 50 fatalities in towns throughout the southeast and widespread destruction of property.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">While the authorities have a duty to investigate the deaths and any criminal activities that occurred, there is no evidence that the violence was the result of the HDP call for protest or that the party could reasonably have been expected to foresee the violent events that would unfold.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">Other HDP members of parliament face similar charges, and eight others are currently held in pretrial detention while the cases against them are heard. In March, Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/20/turkey-crackdown-kurdish-opposition\">issued a report on the crackdown on the HDP and a related local party</a>, The report examined the criminal charges and dismissals affecting elected representatives and assessed the resulting rights violations.</div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\"> </div>\n<div data-type=\"image\" title=\"type: image\">“The evidence against Selahattin Demirtaş consists largely of his political speeches and lacks any compelling evidence of criminal activity,” Williamson said. “It’s hard to conclude otherwise than that the case against him is the Turkish government’s politically motivated attempt to undermine the parliamentary opposition.”</div>",

Monday’s killing of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen, claimed by his foes-turned-friends-turned-foes the Houthi rebels, could have been taken from his own playbook.</p>\n<p>The ending was unjust, and not only because the 75-year-old Saleh may have been summarily executed: his death deprived his countless victims the opportunity to see him face justice.</p>\n<p>During 33 years in office, Saleh was implicated in numerous human rights violations. These included deadly government security force <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/20/yemen-protester-killings-show-perils-immunity-deal\">attacks</a> on largely peaceful protesters, apparent <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/25/yemen-spate-killings-defy-un-order\">indiscriminate shelling</a> on densely populated areas during Yemen’s 2011-12 Arab Uprising, and possible war crimes during his <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2010/04/07/all-quiet-northern-front-0\">civil war</a>s against the Houthis from 2004 to 2010. Starting in 2007, Saleh’s forces also used excessive, deadly force to quash a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2009/12/15/name-unity-0\">separatist movement</a> in the south.</p>\n<p>But Saleh never spent a day behind bars. He was forced out of the presidency in 2012 under an exit deal brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council, largely with international backing, that gave him and his aides <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/10/yemen-reject-immunity-law-president-saleh-and-aides\">blanket immunity</a> from prosecution.</p>\n<p>The deal let Saleh remain in Yemen, where he spent his final years sowing chaos. Houthi-Saleh forces killed and wounded civilians with <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/09/yemen-artillery-attacks-kill-civilians-taizz\">indiscriminate shelling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/20/yemen-houthi-saleh-forces-using-landmines\">landmines</a>.

So has the coalition’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/13/saudi-claims-ease-yemen-blockade-cruel-fiction\">blockade</a> of Yemen, a country with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year\">worst cholera epidemic</a> of modern times and more than eight million people on the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=58209#.WiXY-kqnFPY\">cusp of famine</a>.</p>\n<p>In a cruel irony, Saleh’s offer on Saturday to “turn a new page” with the Saudi-led coalition if it ended the attacks and blockade <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42225574\">reportedly</a> prompted his killing.</p>\n<p>Saleh’s death should open a new era in which the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/08/un-should-consider-sanctions-yemen-aid-obstruction\">United Nations Security Council</a>, Gulf States, the United States, and EU countries that brokered his exit deal to begin positive engagement on Yemen.

The government should immediately cease digital attacks on activists and independent voices, while spyware companies should be far more closely regulated.</p>\n<p>On December 6, 2017, independent researchers at the Toronto-based research center Citizen Lab published a technical analysis showing the <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2017/12/champing-cyberbit-ethiopian-dissidents-targeted-commercial-spyware\">renewed government malware campaign aimed at Ethiopian activists</a> and political opponents. These attacks follow a long, documented <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/25/ethiopia-telecom-surveillance-chills-rights\">history</a> of similar government efforts to monitor critics, inside and outside of Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>“The Ethiopian government has doubled down on its efforts to spy on its critics, no matter where they are in the world,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/cynthia-m-wong\">Cynthia Wong</a>, senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These attacks threaten freedom of expression and the privacy and the digital security of the people targeted.”</p>\n<p>Based on analysis of attacks starting in 2016, the Citizen Lab report identified several targets who received phishing emails, including several ethnic Oromo activists and scholars, one of Citizen Lab’s own research fellows, and Jawar Mohammed, an Oromo activist and executive director of the US-based Oromia Media Network (OMN). During the period of the infections described in the report, there were widespread protests in Ethiopia, beginning with Oromo protests over development plans around the capital, Addis Ababa, which culminated in a 10-month <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/31/ethiopia-state-emergency-risks-new-abuses\">state of emergency</a> that was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/07/state-emergency-ends-ethiopia\">lifted</a> in August 2017. Security forces responded to those largely peaceful protests with <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/15/such-brutal-crackdown/killings-and-arrests-response-ethiopias-oromo-protests\">lethal force</a>, killing over one thousand protesters and detaining tens of thousands more since November 2015.</p>\n<p>The government has gone to various lengths to restrict OMN – an independent media network that covers current events in Oromia, Ethiopia – and other diaspora media outlets. Given Ethiopia’s stranglehold on independent media and access to information, diaspora media outlets provide an important source of information that is independent from government, albeit often heavily politicized.</p>\n<p>OMN played a key role in disseminating information during protests in 2015 and 2016. The government has routinely jammed satellite television programs, arrested informants, pressured satellite companies to drop OMN, arrested people who show OMN in their places of businesses, and charged OMN under the antiterrorism law in October 2016.</p>\n<p>Identified targets in the most recent round of malware attacks were commentators on Ethiopian affairs, who received emails that were tailored to their interests. The emails invited the targets to download and install a software update, which contained malware, to view the content. The phishing attacks, if successful, would have infected their personal computers with spyware. The Citizen Lab report also uncovered dozens of successfully infected devices belonging to other targets in 20 countries, including in the US, UK, Eritrea, Canada, and Germany.</p>\n<p>Citizen Lab’s analysis of the attacks and logfiles places the operator inside Ethiopia and links the software to <a href=\"https://www.cyberbit.com/\">Cyberbit</a>, an Israel-based cybersecurity company. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href=\"http://elbitsystems.com/\">Elbit Systems</a>, an Israel-based defense company. The analysis suggests that the spyware in use is Cyberbit’s PC Surveillance System (PSS), which the company may have recently rebranded as <a href=\"https://www.cyberbit.com/lawful-interception/\">PC 360</a>.</p>\n<p>Cyberbit’s marketing <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170928232123/https:/s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cyberbit/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/05162937/brouchure_PSS_eng_7.pdf\">materials</a> describes PSS as a “comprehensive solution for monitoring and extracting information from remote [personal computers].” Once a computer is infected, the spyware’s operator would gain access to virtually any information available on the device, including files, browsing history, passwords, emails, and what the target types into the computer. The spyware can also take screen shots and activate a computer’s microphone and camera for live surveillance. The marketing materials indicate that PSS was created for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to “reduce crime” and “prevent terrorism.”</p>\n<p>Citizen Lab’s report also identifies potential Cyberbit product demonstrations to possible clients in several other countries, including Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Philippines, Rwanda, Serbia, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>\n<p>This is the third known spyware vendor that the Ethiopian government has engaged since 2013. Human Rights Watch and <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/\">Citizen Lab</a> previously <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/25/ethiopia-telecom-surveillance-chills-rights\">wrote</a> about the government’s use of malware sold by UK/Germany-based Gamma International (reorganized as FinFisher) and Italy-based Hacking Team to target journalists and activists in the Ethiopian diaspora. Authorities continued to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/09/ethiopia-digital-attacks-intensify\">misuse</a> Hacking Team’s product through at least 2015, when a widely covered breach of the company’s corporate data <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/13/ethiopia-hacking-team-lax-evidence-abuse\">confirmed</a> its business in the country.</p>\n<p>The government also has a history of abusing other surveillance technologies, which has facilitated a range of human rights violations. Inside the country, Ethiopian authorities have frequently used mobile surveillance to target independent voices. Human Rights Watch has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/03/25/they-know-everything-we-do/telecom-and-internet-surveillance-ethiopia\">documented</a> how security agencies would play intercepted phone calls during abusive interrogations in an effort to intimidate critics and political opponents into silence.</p>\n<p>Spyware companies often market their products to government agencies tasked with fighting crime or preventing terrorism. However, the Ethiopian government has a documented history of abusing its counterterrorism laws to target <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/01/21/ethiopia-media-being-decimated\">journalists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/23/ethiopia-free-zone-9-bloggers-journalists\">bloggers</a>, protesters, and government critics. At least 85 journalists have fled into exile since 2010 as a result of the government’s ongoing crackdown on independent media. Ethiopia’s laws lack meaningful protections for the right to privacy, and the country’s broad security and law enforcement powers are not adequately regulated to prevent arbitrary, unlawful, or disproportionate surveillance.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/29/letter-cyberbit-solutions-re-sale-and-use-cyberbit-systems-ethiopia\">wrote</a> to Cyberbit to request comment on Citizen Lab’s findings, the company’s approach to assessing the human rights impact of spyware sales to government customers, and what steps the company would take if it uncovered government abuses linked to their product. In a December 5 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/supporting-resources/312227/cyberbit-solutions-response-human-rights-watch\">response</a>, the company stated that it is “a vendor and it does not operate any of its products. Cyberbit Solutions customers are the sole operators of the products at their sole responsibility and they are obliged to do so according to all applicable laws and regulations” in their jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>The company also stated that it offers its products only to government authorities, and any sales of “lawful interception and intelligence products are subject to export control due to their nature and they were sold only after obtaining all relevant authorizations,” including specific approval of a designated government end user.</p>\n<p>Finally, the company stated that while it cannot confirm or deny any specific transaction or client, the company appreciates the concerns raised and is “addressing it subject to the legal and contractual confidentiality obligations Cyberbit Solutions is bound by.”</p>\n<p>Cyberbit should immediately investigate misuse of its products by Ethiopian authorities, publicly disclose its findings, and end any plans for future sales and any ongoing support it may be providing, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>Despite some progress in recent years, the sale of commercial spyware remains poorly regulated at the national and international level, as Ethiopia’s repeated purchase of such tools demonstrates. Since 2014, the European Union and 41 member countries to the <a href=\"http://www.wassenaar.org/\">Wassenaar Arrangement</a> on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies have begun to introduce <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/eu-wants-limit-export-surveillance-technologies-without-hurting-security-research/\">regulations</a> to control the sale of systems like those sold by Cyberbit. However, even where they exist, national implementation of such export controls has been <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/826\">uneven</a>. Some governments do not adequately consider the risk to human rights when evaluating a company’s application to export spyware to repressive regimes.</p>\n<p>While Israel does not formally participate in the Wassenaar Arrangement, it nonetheless incorporates the Wassenaar control lists into its national regulations. Exports of spyware systems from Israel’s thriving cybersecurity industry to foreign governments for security purposes require approval from Israel’s Defense Export Control Agency. Though the agency consults with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is unclear whether the government requires an examination of the end-user’s or destination country’s human rights record and whether the sale might facilitate violations of rights.</p>\n<p>According to 2016 <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-government-okayed-sale-of-spyware-that-exploits-iphones/\">media reports</a>, the agency had previously approved the sale of similar spyware by the Israeli technology company NSO Group to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite its record of surveillance abuses. The UAE later used this technology to <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg7pjy/ahmed-mansoor-million-dollar-dissident-government-spyware\">target</a> a prominent human rights activist, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/20/uae-free-prominent-rights-defender\">Ahmed Mansoor</a>. In October, the export agency <a href=\"http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-defense-ministry-to-ease-export-restrictions-1001209800\">announced</a> that it will loosen some export restrictions, though how the changes will apply to spyware systems remains unclear.</p>\n<p>The latest Ethiopian malware campaign raises significant questions about whether Israel’s export controls are adequate to prevent human rights abuses linked to spyware sales, Human Rights Watch said. Israel and other governments should ensure that such sales are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and evaluate the end-use and human rights record of the end user.</p>\n<p>“It is troubling if Israeli authorities allowed the sale of Cyberbit’s spyware to Ethiopian security agencies, given their established record of using malware to violate rights,” Wong said. “Spyware should be kept far from known human rights abusers.”</p>",

Less than US$1 million of Habré’s assets – a fraction of what Habré is believed to have stolen from Chad – has been recovered so far. Human Rights Watch said the new fund would need to engage professionals to trace and recover assets and to actively seek contributions from willing countries, including countries like the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/28/us-france-backed-convicted-chad-dictator\">United States and France that supported Habré’s rule</a>.</p>\n<p>\tIn addition, in March 2015, a court in Chad <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/25/chad-habre-era-agents-convicted-torture\">convicted</a> 20 Habré-era security agents  for murder and torture and awarded approximately US$125 million in compensation to 7,000 victims, half to be paid by the Chadian government and the other half by those convicted.

Sulak questioned the historical accuracy of a 16th-century elephant battle between the Thai King Naresuan and the Burmese Crown Prince Mingyi Swa, which is commemorated annually as the Thai Armed Forces Day. Sulak <a href=\"http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/international/2017/10/06/military-try-historian-doubting-16th-century-elephant-duel/\">reportedly told a seminar</a> “not to easily believe in anything, otherwise they will fall prey to propaganda.”</p>\n<p>“The junta’s abusive use of the <em>lese majeste</em> law has reached a new height of absurdity when a prominent scholar is charged with a criminal offense for questioning the occurrence of a 16th-century battle,” said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/bios/brad-adams\">Brad Adams,</a> Asia director. “Academic freedom and free speech in Thailand will suffer devastating blows if the trial against Sulak proceeds.”</p>\n<p>Article 112 of Thailand’s Penal Code states, “Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, Heir-Apparent or Regent shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years.”</p>\n<p>Nothing in the law indicates that it can be used to encompass other figures, including past monarchs or historical narratives connected to past reigns. In recent years, however, Thai authorities have interpreted the law increasingly broadly without apparent support in the text of the law.</p>\n<p>In May 2013, the Supreme Court handed down a guilty verdict against Natchakrit Jungruengrit, ruling that he had committed <em>lese majeste </em>because of his comments about King Mongkut, who reigned from 1851 to 1868. The court held that “defaming the former king can affect the current king” and that “King Mongkut was the great grandfather of the current king.”\n<figure>\n<blockquote>\nAcademic freedom and free speech in Thailand will suffer devastating blows if the trial against Sulak proceeds. </blockquote>\n<figcaption>\n<h4>Brad Adams </h4>\n<p>Asia Director </p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>In December 2015, Thai authorities <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/18/thailand-worker-charged-insulting-kings-dog\">arrested factory worker Thanakorn Siripaiboon</a> on lese majeste charges for satirical Facebook commentary about a pet dog of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. His case is currently on trial in the Bangkok Military Court.</p>\n<p>Since the May 2014 military coup in Thailand, at least 105 people have been arrested on lese majeste charges, mostly for posting or sharing critical commentary online. Military courts have imposed harsher sentences for <em>lese majeste </em>offenses than civilian courts did prior to the coup. Some have been convicted and sentenced to decades of imprisonment. For example, in August 2015, the Bangkok Military Court sentenced Pongsak Sriboonpeng to 60 years in prison for making a number of Facebook postings that the court ruled constitute lese majeste, the longest recorded sentence for <em>lese majeste</em> in Thailand’s history. Per standard Thai sentencing rules, the court reduced the sentence by half, to 30 years, when Pongsak agreed to plead guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p>The junta has further tightened its chokehold on free expression by claiming an imperative to protect the monarchy. This is despite various pledges by Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha and other senior officials, including at the United Nations Human Rights Committee in March 2017, that the government values and will respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</p>\n<p>Frank La Rue, the then UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/FR/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11478&LangID=E\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> in October 2011 that: “The threat of a long prison sentence and vagueness of what kinds of expression constitute defamation, insult, or threat to the monarchy, encourage self-censorship and stifle important debates on matters of public interest, thus putting in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression.”</p>\n<p>The junta’s increased use of the lese majeste law has made it more difficult for the police, prosecutors, judges, and other authorities to question the merits of <em>lese majeste</em> allegations – even when those allegations do not conform to the law’s wording – out of concern that they might be accused of disloyalty to the monarchy themselves.</p>\n<p>“Governments should make it clear to the Thai junta that prosecuting a renowned scholar for his historical analysis will have an enormously detrimental impact on Thailand’s reputation as a center for learning and academic freedom,” Adams said. “The case against Sulak Sivaraksa should be immediately and unconditionally dropped.”</p>",

Of these arrests, 31,888 people had no criminal convictions, compared with 11,500 during approximately the same period in 2016.</p>\n<p>Among those interviewed are:</p>\n<ul><li>Linda C., a 29-year-old mother of three US citizen children who came to the US when she was 4 years old, deported after a traffic stop;</li>\n<li>Manuel G., a father with US citizen children and a local leader in Alcoholics Anonymous, deported after 29 years in the US after he was stopped by police for making a wide U-turn;</li>\n<li>Sergio H., a US military veteran, lawful permanent resident, and owner of an auto body shop, deported after convictions related to drug dependency;</li>\n<li>Omar G., who had lived in the US for over 20 years and who cared for his common-law US-citizen wife, who is disabled by crippling pain in her arms;</li>\n<li>Alexis G., a 20-year-old who spent almost his entire life in the US, and who said, “If I were to sing an anthem right now, it would be the Star-Spangled Banner – I don’t know the Mexican anthem”;</li>\n<li>“Orlando,” who had lived in the US for 33 years and the father of a US citizen and a DACA recipient, who was a small business owner and landlord, and who was proud of having never “cost the United States a nickel.”</li>\n</ul><p>The full names or real names of those interviewed are not used for their protection.</p>\n<p>Under current US law, despite these immigrants’ close family relationships to US citizens and long-term presence in the US, they have no realistic way to gain legal status.<article>\n<span></span> <figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/05/deported/immigrants-uprooted-country-they-call-home\">\n<img width=\"289\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/cover/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712us_deported_cover.jpg?itok=jpyjIoBy\" height=\"374\"> </a>\n</figure>\n<div>\n<div><time datetime=\"2017-12-05T14:45:00-05:00\">December 5, 2017</time> <span>Report</span></div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/05/deported/immigrants-uprooted-country-they-call-home\">The Deported</a></h3>\n<p>Immigrants Uprooted from the Country They Call Home</p>\n<div><ul><li><span><img alt=\"PDF icon\" title=\"application/pdf\" src=\"https://www.hrw.org/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png\"> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/201712us_deported_web.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf; length=2012989\" title=\"201712us_deported_web.pdf\">Download the full report</a></span></li> </ul></div> </div>\n</article>\n\n<p>The Obama administration also deported millions of people with longstanding family and other ties to the US, but new policies announced in Obama’s second term focused deportation efforts on recent border-crossers and people with criminal convictions the administration considered most serious. Obama also enacted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program that gave temporary protection from deportation to tens of thousands of people who were brought to the US as children, without legal authorization. As a result, arrests and deportations of immigrants living in the US fell in the last years of the Obama administration. In September, the Trump administration rescinded DACA, exposing these young immigrants who grew up in the US to potential deportation.</p>\n<p>“The stories of the people interviewed make clear the human impact of these stark numbers,” Long said. “Many of the people described how minor interactions with police, such as a traffic stop, triggered deportation, separation from their families, and now ongoing pain as their families struggle financially and emotionally.”</p>\n<p>Governments have considerable leeway under international law to remove noncitizens from their territory, particularly when they are unauthorized. But this discretion is not without limits, Human Rights Watch said. The US has an obligation to weigh the government interest in deporting a person against the impact of removal on fundamental rights, including the right to family unity. In most cases, however, US law governing deportation accords no relevance or weight to immigrants’ ties to home and family. The system also disregards the due process rights of many immigrants, denying many the opportunity to contest their removal at a hearing. Even when immigrants are able to secure an individualized hearing, under US law these factors are in most cases of no legal relevance in deciding whether the person should be removed from the country.</p>\n<p>Congress and the Trump administration should reform the US’s abusive immigration law and policy, starting with passage of a “clean” DREAM Act with no accompanying harmful tradeoffs, such as reduced protections for child migrants and refugees, as the White House has indicated it seeks. Congress should also decline any administration requests to increase funding of immigration enforcement efforts that are not tied to long overdue reforms to immigration law as well as efforts to increase transparency and address abusive conditions in immigration detention.</p>\n<p>US law should be changed to offer a fair, individualized hearing to anyone facing deportation, in which the person’s ties to US families and communities can be weighed against the government’s interest in deporting the person. Those same ties should become the basis for a fair legalization program.</p>\n<p>“At the very least, Congress should pass a clean DREAM act to begin to put some limits on harmful deportations,” Long said. “But the abusive detention and deportation system cannot be fully remedied without wholesale reform of the system.”</p>",
