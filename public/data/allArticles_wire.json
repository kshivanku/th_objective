The state will remain steadfast,” Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said in a video broadcast by local radio after he visited towns<span> hit </span>by clashes.</p>\n<p>While<span> Tunisia </span>is widely seen as the only democratic success story among the Arab Spring nations, it has also had nine governments since then, none of which have been able to deal with growing economic problems.</p>\n<p>The 2011 uprising and two major militant attacks in 2015 damaged foreign investment and tourism, which accounts for 8% of<span> Tunisia</span>‘s economic activity.</p>\n<p>Chahed on Wednesday accused the opposition of fuelling dissent by calling for more<span> protests</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jewish school attacked</strong></p>\n<p>The previous day, petrol bombs were hurled at a Jewish school on the southern tourist island of Djerba, home to an ancient Jewish community.</p>\n<p>There were no<span> protests </span>in Djerba itself, but locals said unknown assailants had exploited the fact that there was a reduced security presence as police were busy elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“Unknown people took the opportunity of the<span> protests </span>and threw Molotov cocktails into the lobby of (the)… school,” the head of the local Jewish community, Perez Trabelsi, told Reuters.</p>\n<p>Jews have lived for over 2,000 years in mainly Muslim<span> Tunisia</span>, where Islamists, secular groups and labour unions have since 2011 argued over what direction the country should take.</p>\n<p>Djerba is home to Africa’s oldest synagogue, which was<span> hit </span>by al Qaeda-linked militants in 2002 in a truck bomb attack that killed 21 people including Western tourists.</p>\n<p>Among the hundreds arrested on Tuesday were two radical Islamists who had helped storm a police station in Nefza town, the interior ministry spokesman said. In Tunis, a crowd stormed a Carrefour market.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11104752/2018-01-11T004448Z_1_LYNXMPEE0A01E_RTROPTP_4_TUNISIA-PROTESTS.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11104752/2018-01-11T004448Z_1_LYNXMPEE0A01E_RTROPTP_4_TUNISIA-PROTESTS.jpg?fit=2979%2C1838\" data-orig-size=\"2979,1838\" data-image-title=\"Riot police clash with protesters during demonstrations against rising prices and tax increases, in Tunis\" class=\"wp-image-212683\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11104752/2018-01-11T004448Z_1_LYNXMPEE0A01E_RTROPTP_4_TUNISIA-PROTESTS.jpg?fit=300%2C185\" data-attachment-id=\"212683\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11104752/2018-01-11T004448Z_1_LYNXMPEE0A01E_RTROPTP_4_TUNISIA-PROTESTS.jpg?resize=1160%2C716&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212679/protests-hit-tunisia-third-night-pm-warns-clampdown/riot-police-clash-with-protesters-during-demonstrations-against-rising-prices-and-tax-increases-in-tunis-2/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11104752/2018-01-11T004448Z_1_LYNXMPEE0A01E_RTROPTP_4_TUNISIA-PROTESTS.jpg?fit=1024%2C632\" alt=\"\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riot police clash with protesters during demonstrations against rising prices and tax increases, in Tunis, Tunisia, January 10, 2018.

Credit: Reuters/Amr Alfiky/Files</p></div>\n<p><strong>Ankara</strong>:<span> Turkey </span>called on<span> Russia </span>and<span> Iran </span>on Wednesday to pressure<span> Syrian </span>authorities to halt a military<span> offensive </span>in Syria’s rebel-held<span> Idlib </span>province, which Damascus launched despite an international deal to reduce hostilities there.</p>\n<p>As pro-government forces pressed the assault, the<span> Russia</span>n defence ministry’s newspaper said Moscow had asked the Turkish military to tighten control over armed groups in<span> Idlib</span>. It said militants had used the province as the launchpad for a drone attack on two<span> Russia</span>n bases in the last week.</p>\n<p><span>Idlib </span>has become a focal point of the<span> Syrian </span>war as government forces and allied militia have thrust towards an insurgent-held air base.<span> Idlib</span>, bordering<span> Turkey</span>, is the largest single chunk of Syria still under the control of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad.</p>\n<p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed grave concern for an estimated two million people in the<span> Idlib </span>region, where the population has grown as<span> Syrian </span>rebels and civilians fled government advances in other areas. Fresh conflict could trigger more displacement on <span>Turkey</span>‘s southern border.</p>\n<p>Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said<span> Russia </span>and<span> Iran </span>must fulfill their duties under a joint accord reached with<span> Turkey </span>last year in which the three countries announced a “de-escalation zone” in<span> Idlib</span>.</p>\n<p>He said advances by the<span> Syrian </span><span>army </span>and allied forces into<span> Idlib </span>could not have taken place without the support of Moscow and Tehran, which have both backed Assad in the war.</p>\n<p>“<span>Iran </span>and<span> Russia </span>need to carry out their responsibilities. If you are guarantors, which you are,<span> stop </span>the regime,” Cavusoglu told the state-run Anadolu news agency in an interview broadcast on Turkish television channels.</p>\n<p>Cavusoglu’s ministry summoned the<span> Iran</span>ian and<span> Russia</span>n ambassadors on Tuesday to complain about violations of the<span> Idlib </span>de-escalation zone, and he said President Tayyip Erdogan might call <span>Russia</span>‘s Vladimir Putin on the issue.</p>\n<p><span>Turkey</span>, which has been fiercely opposed to Assad, has recently been working with his allies<span>Russia </span>and<span> Iran </span>for a political resolution to the conflict. But Cavusoglu said the <span>Idlib</span><span> offensive </span>was endangering those efforts.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a simple air strike, the regime is advancing into<span> Idlib</span>. The goal is different here,” he said. “If the aim here is to make some unwilling opposition groups go to Sochi, it will backfire,” he added, referring to<span> Russia</span>‘s plans to host a congress on Syria at the end of this month.</p>\n<p>In the first attack of its kind, Moscow said on Monday militants had used drones to attack its naval and air bases in the nearby provinces of Tartus and Latakia. The<span> Russia</span>n defence ministry’s newspaper said on Wednesday the drones had been launched from the south-western part of the<span>Idlib </span>de-escalation zone held by “moderate opposition” armed groups.</p>\n<p><strong>60,000 displaced</strong></p>\n<p><span>Syrian </span>government forces have taken scores of villages in recent weeks near the provincial border between<span> Idlib </span>and Hama, with the help of<span> Iran</span>-backed militias and<span> Russia</span>n air power. They have progressed towards the Abu al-Duhur military airport, where rebels completely ousted the<span>army </span>in 2015.</p>\n<p>The forces had advanced to within three km of the air base on Wednesday, said a military media unit run by Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which fights on the<span> Syrian </span><span>army</span>‘s side.</p>\n<p>The<span> Syrian </span>Observatory for Human Rights said the<span> army </span>and allied militias captured 16 villages and positions on Wednesday. They clashed with Tahrir al-Sham fighters around the airport, the Britain-based war monitoring group said.</p>\n<p>The combatants also battled from another direction along a front south of Aleppo city, near the border with<span> Idlib</span>.</p>\n<p>Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch is now the dominant insurgent force in the northwestern province of<span> Idlib</span>.</p>\n<p>Rebel groups seized<span> Idlib</span>, which borders<span> Turkey</span>, in 2015 and it has since become the only<span> Syrian</span>province fully under insurgent control.</p>\n<p>Fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since November 1, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).</p>\n<p>“What I am seeing here is the use of the presence of al Nusra and HTS as an excuse to attack civilians and moderate oppositions,” Cavusoglu added.</p>\n<p>Under last year’s deal with<span> Iran </span>and<span> Russia</span>,<span> Turkey </span>says it has deployed troops to observation points in northern<span> Idlib</span>, about 60 km (40 miles) north of the latest <span>Syrian </span><span>army</span><span> offensive</span>.</p>\n<p>Cavusoglu said Ankara would host a meeting on Syria with like-minded countries after the summit in<span> Russia</span>‘s Sochi.</p>\n<p>With<span> Russia</span>n and<span> Iran</span>ian backing, government forces have recovered large swathes of territory from rebel factions and Islamic State militants over the past year.</p>\n<p>Assad and his allies now command the single largest chunk of Syria, followed by US-backed Kurdish militias who control much of the north and east Syria and are more concerned with shoring up their regional autonomy than fighting Damascus.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212671/turkey-urges-russia-iran-stop-syrian-army-offensive-idlib/\">Turkey Urges Russia, Iran to Stop Syrian Army Offensive in Idlib</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p><strong><span>Rome:</span></strong> This year, we will have three million tourists each day wandering the world. This massive phenomenon is without precedent in human history and is happening (as usual), with only one consideration in mind: money. We should pause and take a look at its social, cultural and environmental impact and take remedial measures, because they are becoming seriously negative if things are left as they are.</p>\n<p>Sameer Kapoor listed for Triphobo Trip Planner a list of 20 places that have been ruined due to excess of tourism. Antarctica is getting an alarming level of pollution. The famous Taj Mahal, a monument of love from the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to the memory of his wife, Mumtaz, has changed its shining milky white marble into a yellow shade. Mount Everest is strewn with trash from invading visitors. The Great Wall of China has been so mistreated by the massive invasion of tourists that it has begun to crumble in places. The famous beaches of Bali are littered with trash, traffic is in a gridlock and roads and footpaths are in a dangerous state of disrepair. Macchu Picchu has a such large number of visitors that archaeologists are worried about preservation of the site. Once there was a train to a small village, Aguas Calientes, to then continue by foot or mules. Now you can reach the enigmatic and sacred Inca citadel by air conditioned bus and Aguas Calientes is now a town of 4.000 people with five star hotels. The famous Australian Coral Reef Barrier has lost already one third of the corals. The Galapagos islands, where Charles Darwin conceived his famous theory of natural selection, has so many visitors impinging on his fragile eco balance that in 2007 UNESCO placed it on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites but to no avail. The Parthenon has many visitors taking pieces of rocks and ruins and drawing or carving on ancient pillars that special police squad had to be created. The wonders of Angkor Wat in Cambodia is suffering the same fate, together with the Colosseum in Rome, where every week somebody gets caught for chipping away pieces of columns or graffiting the pillars. But may be the best example of the negative impact of tourism is Venice.</p>\n<p>The town has now officially 54,000 residents. They were 100,000 in 1970. Every year 1,000 residents leave for the mainland because rents and cost of life keeps going up and the hordes of tourist make life impossible for the residents. The number of sweepers and cleaners employed by the city has to go up continuously. Giant ships continue to go over the delicate micro system of the lagoon and their lobby is very strong. They insist that without their mega-ships landing at the centre of the town, 5,000 jobs would be in danger. There is now a clear conflict between those who live off tourism and those who have other jobs. Like in Barcelona, residents now stage demonstrations against mass tourism. Venice will become a ghost town like the village of Mont Saint Michel, the medieval village in Normandy, jammed by thousands of visitors to see the famous high-speed sea tide. At night, 42 people sleep there.</p>\n<p>What is impressive is the speed of the phenomenon since 1950 when the total tourist numbers were 25 million, two-thirds to Europe meant 29.76%of the tourists, Africa a mere 1.98% and the Middle East 0.79%, like Asia and Pacific. Sixty-six years later, tourist numbers rose to 1.2 billion, Europe is down to 50%, Americas to 16.55%, Africa is at 4.52%, while the Middle East is at 4.7%. And Asia Pacific? It is now at 24.2%.</p>\n<p>What is more impressive is to look further – at 2030, for which we have all the data (from the UN World Tourism Organisation). Well, in a short time, we will go up to 1.8 billion: five million tourists every day. Europe is again down to 41%, America is down to 14%, Asia up to 30%, Africa to 7% and Middle east to 8%. A totally inverted world in respect to 1950.</p>\n<p>Tourism is already the largest employer in the world: one person every 11. China has surpassed the US as the largest nationality. In 2016, they have spent US $261 billion, and they will spend $429 billion in 2020. UNWTO points to the fact that in 2025, China will have 92.6 million families with an income between $20,000 and $30,000 per year; 63 million with an income between $35,000 and $70,000 per year and 21.3 million, with an income between $70,000 and $130,000. A large part of them is expected to travel and spend money. How many people speak Chinese and know anything about their idiosyncrasies ?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09124436/tourism.jpg?fit=640%2C388\" data-orig-size=\"640,388\" data-image-title=\"Russian tourists are pictured beside a swimming pool at the Steigenberger Kantaoui Bay resort, previously Imperial Marhaba hotel, in Sousse\" class=\"wp-image-212046\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09124436/tourism.jpg?fit=300%2C182\" data-attachment-id=\"212046\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09124436/tourism.jpg?resize=640%2C388&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212017/tourism-regulated-late/russian-tourists-are-pictured-beside-a-swimming-pool-at-the-steigenberger-kantaoui-bay-resort-previously-imperial-marhaba-hotel-in-sousse/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09124436/tourism.jpg?fit=640%2C388\" alt=\"Russian tourists are pictured beside a swimming pool at the Steigenberger Kantaoui Bay resort, previously Imperial Marhaba hotel, in Sousse, Tunisia, September 29, 2017.

For instance, a large part of the jobs is in fact only seasonal and poorly paid. Most of the money does not stay in the place where it is spent, but goes back to big companies and food imported for the tourist’s habits. It is calculated that in the Caribbean, a full 70% goes back to US and Canada. Culture and traditions are influenced as outsiders come. Local culture and traditions become just a show for foreigners and can lose roots. Hotels are built just for tourism in the most beautiful spots, degrading habitat and nature. Price increases in local shops, because tourists are often wealthier than the local population. It is sufficient to go to a town which is out of the tourist’s circuits to see the difference. In fact, now there is a growing search for “intact” places, different from “tourist” places. Tourist restaurants have become synonymous with poor food and high prices. And a tourist place is one that has lost its identity to conform with the demands of tourists. It has been the proliferation of Mc Donalds, Pizza Huts and other fast food joints, often in the most beautiful parts of towns, that pushed Petrini, in an old village with gastronomic tradition, Bra in Piedmont, to start a movement called ‘Slow Food movement’. The movement defends the freshness of materials, that must be local, preserving the original and traditional cuisines and defending local products form the ongoing homogenisation. It has now over 100,000 members in 150 countries, which defends identity against globalisation.</p>\n<p>Florence can well be a good example of how tourism is uprooting the locals’ identity and tradition. It was since the renaissance, a place of art and culture. It was a must for cultured tourists and the forebearers of today’s tourists: German, British and French visitors, until the World War II. A city of elegance, antique dealers, art shops, handcrafts and a very recognised Florentine cuisine.</p>\n<p>Now it is full of tourist’s shops, jeans places, cheap standardised handcraft, a lot of pizzeria and tourist restaurants. The concierge of the classical Hotel Baglioni, when questioned about the decay of the town, had a simple answer: “Sir, we are a town of merchants. We did create the letter of change, the banks, and the international trade. Here come people who looked for art and antiques. Today we are awash with people who want to buy blue jeans and cheap stuff. We provide with what people want”. And for those living in Rome, the main street via del Corso has suffered the same transformation.</p>\n<p>It is scary to think what will happen when in the not so far 2020, 100 million Chinese will travel worldwide, with Europe as their first destination. Anybody who had a Chinese visitor (or from a different culture) knows how difficult it is for him to understand what he sees. One of the main artistic European buildings are churches, and for a totally different religion, they are strange places. It makes no sense to a Chinese what is Romanesque or Baroque, as they do not have any equivalent at home. And the classical tourist tour is now for about a week, in which they see at least five towns. This is the equivalent for a European to visit the temples in Tibet, without having studied Tibetan Buddhism, which is very different from other branches of Buddhism. Or, for that matter, visit the Egyptian temples without some knowledge at least of the Egyptian cosmology, the reigns of death and the Pantheon of Gods. What will be remembered is the size of the pyramids, the smell of the incense in Buddhist temples and other mere aesthetical impression. That has nothing to do with culture and art.</p>\n<p>To talk about the negative impacts of tourism opens inevitably the question of classism. The more cultured you are, the more you can get from your travels. Does that mean that only cultured people (that until the World War II, also meant affluent: today the two concepts have split, may be for ever), should travel? Is tourism not a way to enrich and educate, so it should be on the contrary an important tool for the less cultivated?</p>\n<p>I do not think that there is an easy answer to this issue. What I know is that only a small minority of those visiting the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, or the Potala Palace in Lhasa, or the valley of the kings in Egypt, have a book in their hands, that they have bought to prepare themselves. They depend on their tour guides who confess that they do not even try to teach, but only to show what their tourists can all understand. That means that when you are in the Sistine Chapel, you are nearly unable to move, while the custodians try to move people on so to make space for the waiting line of visitors. Among that crowd, there are some people who can place the difference between Michelangelo and Matisse and would certainly benefit from some more time, while this is irrelevant for others.</p>\n<p>It is clear that we cannot let 1.8 billion people wander in the world without introducing some global regulations on how to limit the negative aspects of tourism and relating it not only to money, but to education, culture and personal development. To come in touch with different cultures, civilisations, foods, habits and realities should be an occasion that should not be left only to money. A paradox is that we are fighting against immigrants because of different cultures, but we accept gladly the same people if they come as tourist and not as refugees. And the other paradox is the two parallel words which coexist: one, the real, about poverty and violence that we read in newspapers and another of the same place, which exists only for tourists, about the beautiful beaches, wonderful nature and fantastic hotels.</p>\n<p>Right now, you can visit the Vatican after its closing, with a modest fee of €100 per person, in quiet and small numbers. Is the future of tourism made with two tracks where money will be the dividing factor? It is obvious that we should link tourism to education and culture. A proposal is simply to ask every tourist when he buys a tour, an airline ticket, or asks for a visa to buy and read a very simple and schematic book (they do not exist until now) which can be read and understood in no more than ten hours about what he or she is going to visit. A small commission formed by one teacher of history, one of geography and one of art, is established in any small or large cities, where now lives the large majority of the population. In all of them, there are schools with these studies. They conduct a small exam and charge a small fee for a certificate to justify their extra work. Tourists can choose to go to the commission or not. Few extremely simple questions such as – which is the capital of the countries you are going to visit? Is the country independent? Is it a monarchy or a republic? How does it makes its money? Its monument and art have different moments in history? The commission would give two certificates. One would give access to museums and monuments for the first two hours of the day and only those with the certificate could then enter. After those two hours everybody with the two certificates can enter. But this would enable those who can understand and enrich themselves to have some time in peace and quiet.</p>\n<p>This would make two tracks of tourism, not based on money. And this could generate a demonstration effect, where tourists would probably dedicate sometime to prepare themselves. I asked one former director general of UNESCO what he thought of a such proposal. His answer was – it is a great idea, but where is the political will to support this\\or, for that matter any international agreement?</p>\n<p><em>(IPS)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212017/tourism-regulated-late/\">Tourism Should Be Regulated Before It’s Too Late</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Jelle Visser/Flickr</p></div>\n<p>Hundreds of men buried alive, men and women mutilated and slaughtered, children killed before their mothers’ eyes, a grandfather forced to eat the liver of his own grandson. These are truly scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human history.</p>\n<p>This chilling description of the Srebrenica genocide was written by a <a href=\"http://www.icty.org/en/press/radovan-karadzic-and-ratko-mladic-accused-genocide-following-take-over-srebrenica\" title=\"judge\" target=\"_blank\">judge</a> at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague in November 1995, only months after Europe’s worst crime since the Second World War. In July of that year, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of the Srebrenica enclave – a designated UN safe area – from international peacekeepers. They separated the men and women and in the days that followed killed more than 7,000 men and boys.</p>\n<p>As Ratko Mladic, the wartime commander of Bosnian Serb forces, begins his life sentence as an architect of those crimes and with the court that convicted him having closed on December 21 after almost a quarter of a century, it’s a good moment to look at the tribunal’s achievements – and its limits.</p>\n<p><strong>A success on its own terms</strong></p>\n<p>The break-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that began in 1991 unleashed a series of wars – in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later in Kosovo and Macedonia.</p>\n<p>The bloodiest of them, in Bosnia, gave birth to a new phrase “ethnic cleansing,” because of the deliberate forced displacement of civilians belonging to a particular ethnic group to create ethnically homogenous areas. The world watched in horror as Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, was besieged, its people shot by snipers as they went to gather water or firewood.</p>\n<p>The unfolding atrocities documented by a UN commission of experts, non-governmental groups, and journalists led the UN Security Council to set up the court in 1993 with a simple purpose: “prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.”</p>\n<p>On that score, it has been a remarkable success. All of the court’s 161 indictees – including many top war-time political leaders and military commanders – faced justice before it for horrific crimes including the Srebrenica genocide, or have died.</p>\n<p>The tribunal’s success was not a foregone conclusion. While it was hoped its mandate would help deter abuses and bring those responsible for the worst crimes to justice, the tribunal was slow to make good on those promises. Building on the work of the UN commission, it gathered evidence and issued indictments. But lacking a police force, it had difficulty getting those it indicted into the dock in The Hague.</p>\n<p>In 1997, two years after the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the tribunal had only eight suspects in custody, most of them “little fish.” More than 50 remained at large in Bosnia, and the prospect of arresting high-level suspects seemed remote.</p>\n<p>That changed because of the efforts of human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, and supportive governments, first through pressure to get the NATO peace-keepers in Bosnia to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/legacy/press/factsht.htm\" title=\"arrest suspects\" target=\"_blank\">arrest suspects</a> in that country, and later though political pressure on Croatia and Serbia by the EU and US to hand over suspects on their territory.</p>\n<p>As time marched on and diplomats’ memories of the grim human rights violations faded, it became harder to get the EU to remain firm on the conditions it had set for possible membership by Serbia and Croatia, including turning over suspects. Some EU governments wanted to embrace Croatia and Serbia without any guarantee of the handover of key suspects.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, with non-governmental groups <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/03/25/letter-eu-relations-serbia-and-icty-cooperation\" title=\"pressing the issue\" target=\"_blank\">pressing the issue</a> and magnifying the voices of victims, media scrutiny, and the fortitude of the Netherlands and a handful of other EU states, the EU held firm. That meant that the big targets – including the Croatian general Ante Gotovina, the Bosnian Serb wartime president Radovan Karadzic, and Mladic – were eventually arrested and sent to The Hague to face justice.</p>\n<p><strong>Justice isn’t perfect, but it’s possible </strong></p>\n<p>Through its work, the ICTY gave life to the idea that justice is possible, and can reach the untouchable, even if its realisation seems impossible while conflict is raging. It helped develop international criminal law in relation to genocide, crimes against humanity, the responsibility of commanders for the crimes of their subordinates, and rape and sexual violence in conflict as war crimes.</p>\n<p>The ICTY also contributed to the momentum that led to the creation of the International Criminal Court to tackle impunity around the world. So far, 123 states are members of this court, which is currently investigating atrocities in 10 countries. The ICC faces many of the same challenges that plagued the ICTY in its early days, including inconsistent political support (the US, for example, has refused to join) and cooperation from countries in securing evidence and in arresting suspects.</p>\n<p>These ongoing challenges offer a stark reminder of the difficulties of realizing justice for unspeakable horrors. They also illustrate the importance of pressing on, as the victims of these crimes too often have little hope of seeing justice otherwise.</p>\n<p>The ICTY was not perfect, of course.</p>\n<p>Crimes against minorities during and after the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo arguably didn’t get enough attention, and the cases that were brought were undermined by witness intimidation. The court was slow to make its judgments known and understood across the region, which left space for hostile politicians to sow misperceptions about its work.</p>\n<p>The tribunal’s judges sometimes struggled to strike a balance between fairness to defendants and efficient prosecution of the trial, with defendants like former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic using the courtroom to broadcast political messages to audiences at home and dragging out their trial for years. Milosevic infamously died before the court issued its verdict. That led to understandable – and intense – disappointment and frustration for victims and their families.</p>\n<p><strong>Ongoing divisions</strong></p>\n<p>While the ICTY was ultimately a success in accomplishing what the UN Security Council established it to do – prosecuting and trying some of the key architects of the wars in the former Yugoslavia – its impact and legacy in the Western Balkans is mixed.</p>\n<p>Critics point to the <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/reconciliation-stalled-in-the-western-balkans\" title=\"deep divisions\" target=\"_blank\">deep divisions</a> that remain in the region, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as evidence of the court’s failure. Many of the foot soldiers who carried out the atrocities as well as mid-level commanders remain free, and the domestic war crimes prosecutions that were supposed to deal with them have been slow and limited in scope. Politicians in some communities have successfully characterised the ICTY’s conviction of their wartime leaders as evidence that it is an instrument of persecution, feeding into existing narratives of victimhood.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10172447/graffiti-of-Bosnian-Serb-wartime-general-Ratko-Mladic.jpeg?fit=728%2C467\" data-orig-size=\"728,467\" data-image-title=\"A woman walks past graffiti of Bosnian Serb wartime general Ratko Mladic in a suburb of Belgrade\" class=\"wp-image-212573\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10172447/graffiti-of-Bosnian-Serb-wartime-general-Ratko-Mladic.jpeg?fit=300%2C192\" data-attachment-id=\"212573\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A woman walks past graffiti of Bosnian Serb wartime general Ratko Mladic in a suburb of Belgrade, Serbia.

The court’s registry woke up too late to the importance of outreach, by which time the region’s political leaders had already established their own poisonous narratives. And it perhaps could have transferred the evidence and skills to local prosecutors and courts sooner to build national capacity for war crimes justice, although lack of political and financial support from Bosnia’s international partners is arguably a much more important factor.</p>\n<p>But those who malign the ICTY’s failure to bring reconciliation and end political division in the region had outsized expectations of what it could deliver. A better question to ask is this: How would the region and its politics look today without the ICTY? As difficult as things are in the region today, they would have been incalculably worse had leaders responsible for unleashing and directing horrific political violence remained in office and in command.</p>\n<p><strong>A more comprehensive approach</strong></p>\n<p>To help heal the political divisions in the region and move toward reconciliation, the Western Balkans needs a regional truth commission, a <a href=\"http://recom.link/about-us-2/sta-je-koalicija-za-rekom/\" title=\"goal\" target=\"_blank\">goal</a> long pushed by nongovernmental groups. And governments in the region need to intensify efforts to prosecute war crimes in local courts. That requires the EU, the US, and other international actors to invest the political and economic capital to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now that the ICTY has pulled down the shutters, the urgency of pressing for a more comprehensive approach to documenting the truth is even more apparent. The Western Balkans has far too long been neglected by the EU and US. The <a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/36757/remarks-high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-joint-press-statement-rex_en\" title=\"joint statement\" target=\"_blank\">joint statement</a> by the EU High Representative and US Secretary of State on December 5 on the importance of reconciliation in the region should signal an intensification of EU and US support for those efforts.</p>\n<p>The ICTY has had a necessary and important, even if limited, impact on establishing the truth behind those bearing responsibility for the atrocities and devastation that followed the onslaught of the wars in the Balkans. Its closure only underscores the importance of supporting and continuing the hard and necessary work to bring full justice and reconciliation to Western Balkans.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><em>Benjamin Ward is the deputy Europe and Central Asia director and Param-Preet Singh is associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Foreign Policy In Focus</em>)</p>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212439/the-promise-and-limits-of-international-justice-reflected-in-yugoslavias-war-crimes-tribunal/\">The Promise and Limits of International Justice Reflected in Yugoslavia’s War Crimes Tribunal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Facebook</p></div>\n<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> At a time when powerful youth leaders are challenging traditional politics, particularly by standing up to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and questioning its Hindutva ideology, peasants’ rights activist from Assam, Akhil Gogoi, suddenly seems to have gained a renewed significance – not just in Assam but in the national political landscape as well.</p>\n<p>On January 9, he was in New Delhi to participate in the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212316/yuva-hunkar-rally-youth-leaders-modi-govt/\" title=\"Yuva Hunkar rally\" target=\"_blank\">Yuva Hunkar rally</a> which was led by Jignesh Mevani, the young firebrand legislator from Gujarat. The protest was organised by several young and independent leaders against what they called the Narendra Modi government’s “anti-people” policies. The rally was also said to be a preparation for a political alternative for governance, keeping the 2019 parliamentary polls in mind.</p>\n<p>Gogoi, president of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), has recently been released from jail after having been charged first of sedition and then under the National Security Act (NSA) by the Assam government. In an interview with <em>The Wire</em> during his Delhi visit, he answered a range of questions, including on the imminent foray of his organisation into electoral politics.</p>\n<p>The interview was conducted in Assamese and translated into English.</p>\n<p>Excerpts:</p>\n<p><strong>You were kept in custody for 105 days – from September 13 to December 27. Was this your longest [time in jail] since you began your public life? </strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Till now, I have been sent to jail 14 times between the Congress and the BJP governments in Assam; this was the longest continuous period I was kept in jail.</p>\n<p><strong>Also, unlike before, the charges against you were of sedition and then you were rearrested under the NSA. How different was it this time in terms of your jail stay? Also, what was your mental state considering two serious charges were brought against you by the state in quick succession?</strong></p>\n<p>In the last 13 times that I have been to jail, I was kept like any other undertrial. But this time, it was different. I was not allowed to meet anybody from outside. An order was passed stating that not even my lawyers can meet me. There is a rule under NSA that an undertrial can meet family or friends twice a week. But the deputy commissioner of Nagaon (he submitted a report to the local court in Dibrugarh saying Gogoi should be charged under the NSA) issued an order that no friends would be allowed to meet me. That was how I was kept away from most people. Any contact with the outside world was snapped by the state. When I was presented in front of the NSA advisory board, I pleaded that I should at least be allowed to meet my lawyers. The board agreed and issued an oral order which was followed by a written order by the Dibrugarh jail superintendent. What I mean to say is, even to access legal advise, I had to try for about a month.</p>\n<p>Inside the jail, I was kept in a separate chamber. Two jail policemen and two senior convicts were assigned to stand in front of the chamber to prevent any undertrial, detainee or convict from meeting me. So I was not allowed normal human contact even within the jail.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this not your second time in jail after the BJP-led government came to power in Assam?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. During the Congress regime whenever I was arrested, I would be taken to a guest house etc., shown some iota of respect as a political rival, given at least a bed to sleep on – because most of those cases were of a political kind. But in the BJP’s time, the government used lock-ups both times. You have to see the police lock-ups in Assam to understand their pathetic condition. When I was arrested on September 13, I was not even allowed to wear a shirt or change into my trousers. A bunch of policemen covered my mouth, lifted me and dumped me into a police vehicle and whisked me away. This time it was a deliberate attempt at nastiness.</p>\n<p>Also, what I want to point out here is that when I related to the court the treatment I was meted out by the state police, it didn’t record it. Even the fact that when honourable Justice of the Supreme Court Ranjan Gogoi, along with the Chief Justice of Gauhati high court (Ajit Singh) and Justice Hrishikesh Roy (of the HC) were to visit the Dibrugarh jail on December 16 to inaugurate a digitised legal cell there, the state made an attempt to keep me out of the jail that day. Even though the scheduled date for me to present myself in person at the local court as per the NSA was December 19, the secretary of the state’s home department arrived in Dibugarh from Guwahati to request the court to bring it forward to December 16, fearing that I might relate the treatment meted out to me to the visiting justices. So the date was brought forward.</p>\n<p>However, when the undertrials and the convicts of the jail came to know about it, they got together and revolted against, threatening to break the jail if I was forcibly taken to the court on December 16. On December 17, they began a fast in protest, also demanding jail reforms such as clean drinking water, better food, better living conditions, etc. I lent my support to their movement for their rights.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212293/yuva-hunkar-modi-government-threat-democracy-constitution/\" title=\"Yuva Hunkar: ‘Modi Government a Threat to Democracy, Constitution’\" target=\"_blank\">Yuva Hunkar: ‘Modi Government a Threat to Democracy, Constitution’</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>So what I understood was that a typical day in the jail this time was mostly of confinement within a chamber.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Since I was not allowed to meet anyone, I made a plea in the court that I be allowed to read some books. Then, some titles like <em>Nations and Nationalism in a Global Era</em> by Anthony D. Smith and Ernest Gellner’s <em>Nationalism</em> were sent from home for me with permission. Also, I am writing a book on Assamese sub-nationalism. During my jail term, I could finish writing the introduction to it.</p>\n<p><strong>KMSS leaders told the local media that you were not allowed access to health facilities in detention. Was that true?</strong></p>\n<p>When I was kept in the lock-up for four days, I was given a very dirty blanket to use. You have to see the lock-ups to believe in what state they are in and the kind of blankets given to the detainees. There was a professional thief also along with me in the lock-up. Both of us were given extremely dirty blankets to use. In those four days, small boils broke out on some part of my head. Within the next 15 days, they covered my entire head. The police wouldn’t take me to the doctor. The in-house doctor was not a specialist, he had no idea how to treat them. So he kept writing in his report that I should be sent to the hospital, but this was not done by the district administration under the excuse of a security problem as I was detained under the NSA.</p>\n<p>After over a month had passed, a specialist was brought to the jail but he didn’t have the required equipment to treat the boils. Then, I had to give a prayer to the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Dibrugarh seeking permission to get adequate treatment. Even after the court permitted it, I was not taken to the hospital for over two weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Who from your family visited you in jail?</strong></p>\n<p>My mother and my wife. I have a school-going son; I didn’t see him during the period of my stay in jail.</p>\n<p><strong>In the first interview you gave to an Assamese news channel after coming out of detention, you said that your son was affected a lot by your stay in jail this time.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, he was. Since the day I was taken to jail, he stopped going to school. He is in sixth standard. He underwent a lot of trauma this time. There was so much police pressure on my family; then the relentless reporting by news media – particularly when he saw the clippings showing how I was dragged out of home by the police. He was traumatised by it all. He not only skipped school but also didn’t appear in two of his exams during that time. He began to suspect people, began getting easily emotional. My wife was alarmed by it. She took him to the doctor. He has begun going to school only after I have returned home.</p>\n<p>Both my mother and my wife are my huge support. My mother lives in our village home. A KMSS colleague stays with her. But this time, she too spent her time in a lot of anxiety. I have not been able to visit my village home yet but she came over to Guwahati to see me after I was released. Once I return from Delhi, I plan to visit her at her house.</p>\n<p>I am also very grateful to my wife. I don’t know how to thank her for all the support. I don’t earn anything. It is she who runs the house, looks after the family.</p>\n<p><strong>Now that you are out of jail, have you chalked out any immediate plan for your organisation to take forward the issues that it has been raising, such as the Modi government’s Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016?  </strong></p>\n<p>The first duty of KMSS now is to fight the fascist forces in the state. We have observed that it is becoming very difficult for traditional people’s movements which speak of socio-economic issues to resist the fascism of the BJP by only raising questions on the economy. Simply because the BJP has glossed over the economic issues. When we raised class issues earlier, they had a certain sharpness about them, certain meaning, but the BJP, mostly through media hype and other tools, succeeded in creating a general environment across the country which downplays those economic questions. So much so that however relevant they may be, they don’t quite stir the common man at once, such as issues like rising prices of food, cooking gas, fuel, etc. Even demonetisation was glossed over as a public good. Take the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which broke the back of the country’s federal structure. The autonomy of the state (the power to formulate its own tax structure) was demolished by the GST. And yet, there was no protest coming from the states. Instead, states like Assam competed with other BJP-ruled states to be the first to pass the GST Bill in the assembly.</p>\n<p>It is particularly unfortunate for a state like Assam to be the first to implement it, considering it has always withstood the exploitative tactics of the central government on its economy and supported more and more decentralisation of power. Even in the constituent assembly debate, the basic demand stated by the eight representatives of Assam was for more power to the states. That same Assam now says we will be the first to mention in our textbooks about the implementation of GST.</p>\n<p>So at a time when economic questions are being glossed over, questions on caste, ethnicity and sub-nationalism have become far more significant in the Northeast. The biggest injustice the BJP government at the Centre has done to the Northeast is the removal of the special category status that we had in 2015. But we couldn’t resist it. Only KMSS did a few meetings opposing it but it was not effective. The public was not stirred by it. Simply because the economic questions have been successfully glossed over by the BJP.</p>\n<p>Still, questions like those of farmers’ rights, about giving Scheduled Tribe status to six communities, more autonomy to the tribals, protecting the rights of Muslims who are increasingly facing eviction and primarily the question about the rights of the indigenous people are becoming quite significant in Assam. The biggest question of them all, which has pushed the people of Assam to unite against the BJP government, is based on the indigenous one, against which the party is trying to bring an amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955. It is trying to create a ‘Hindu <em>rashtra</em>‘ by getting as many people as possible from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by inserting a sub-section in section 2 of the Act to change the definition of the illegal migrant. The BJP-RSS is openly saying that if anybody from Bangladesh enters Assam with a <em>Gita</em> in hand and not a <em>Quran</em>, he/she will have the right to settle in the state.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10182530/KMSS-leader-Akhil-Gogoi-in-New-Delhi-Photo-Sangeeta-Barooah-Pisharoty.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10182530/KMSS-leader-Akhil-Gogoi-in-New-Delhi-Photo-Sangeeta-Barooah-Pisharoty.jpg?fit=3096%2C4128\" data-orig-size=\"3096,4128\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10182530/KMSS-leader-Akhil-Gogoi-in-New-Delhi-Photo-Sangeeta-Barooah-Pisharoty.jpg?fit=225%2C300\" data-attachment-id=\"212581\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10182530/KMSS-leader-Akhil-Gogoi-in-New-Delhi-Photo-Sangeeta-Barooah-Pisharoty.jpg?resize=367%2C490&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212527/assam-bjp-akhil-gogoi/kmss-leader-akhil-gogoi-in-new-delhi-photo-sangeeta-barooah-pisharoty/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10182530/KMSS-leader-Akhil-Gogoi-in-New-Delhi-Photo-Sangeeta-Barooah-Pisharoty.jpg?fit=768%2C1024\" alt=\"KMSS leader Akhil Gogoi in New Delhi.

Credit: Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty</p></div>\n<p>The argument of the BJP-RSS that the Muslim population is rising in Assam and, therefore, they will bring Hindus from Bangladesh, is based on their policy of making a Hindu state and thereby creating an immigrant Hindu vote bank, like the Congress’s immigrant Muslim vote bank. This plan is not good for the Assamese community. We will finally lose our electoral voice. So this game plan of the BJP has become a challenge for the survival of the Assamese people, our language, our culture. That is why the indigenous question, the <em>jatiotabad </em>(sub-nationalist) question, has rattled the Assamese people.</p>\n<p>That is why people like us who believe in class struggle will have to engage beyond the economic issue. Along with it, we will have to engage with the question of sub-nationality, ethnicity, religious atrocities; we will have to club all these questions along with the political and economic questions. That is what we are trying to do now.</p>\n<p><strong>Recently, you appealed to the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) to break its alliance with the BJP and form a government of its own with support from regional parties like the Bodo People’s’ Front (BPF) and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) with outside support from the Congress. What was the thought behind it?</strong></p>\n<p>Since some time, the AGP has lost its significance as a strong regional force in Assam. Simply because it only concentrated on elections and didn’t raise its voice on regional issues as it should have. It didn’t take any clear stand on people’s issues. Therefore, the BJP gobbled up its space, forcing the AGP to go with it in the May 2016 assembly polls. People voted for the cause of <em>jati, mati, bheti </em>(community, land and existence). However, now the BJP is clearly attacking the regional interests by trying to facilitate 1.92 crore Bangladeshi Hindus to settle in Assam. It has attacked the very reason that AGP was born – the Assam Accord based on the foreigners’ issue. If the BJP succeeds in bringing those Bangladeshi Hindus to Assam, the Accord itself will get nullified.</p>\n<p>So I strongly feel that it is a great chance for the AGP to revive itself. If they have the courage to resist BJP, stand up to it, it can yet again become a strong regional force. The Assamese people have given AGP a lot, it is the time for the AGP to give something back to the people. So I suggested that it should break the alliance and form a new alliance with regional parties and demand that the Congress gives its outside support. AGP will have to lead now. We should give some space also to Ganasakti, the political party that represents the Mishing tribe. The AGP can stop BJP’s communal agenda and the attempt to tarnish our social fabric and communal harmony. It is an appeal to the AGP.</p>\n<p><strong>You have made a similar appeal to the All Assam Students Union (AASU).</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, not just AASU but we have appealed to all the sub-nationalist organisations such as the Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP), the tribal and ethnic groups, students’ bodies, the anti-imperialist forces, the anti-feudal forces, minority students organisations such as the Bengali Students Federation, etc. to come out against the attempt at the social engineering by the Sangh <em>parivar</em>.</p>\n<p>KMSS’s basic difference with AASU is that we believe in class struggle, speak about the rights of the poor, the farmers, and AASU, as a jatiotabadi organisation, represents the middle-class voice. However, now that the Assamese sub-nationalism is under attack from Sangh parivar, which AASU too espouses, it is the clarion call of the time for everyone who believe in jatiotabad to come together.</p>\n<p>That is why we think that we need to bury all our petty differences in order to save the Assamese community. Otherwise, our dream for a good future for our state will be over, our communal harmony will be lost forever, we will lose our voice in ruling the state. Together we will have to resist this covert plan on us by the fascist forces.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10105817/yuva-hunkar.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10105817/yuva-hunkar.jpg?fit=4800%2C2969\" data-orig-size=\"4800,2969\" data-image-title=\"Jignesh Mevani Rally\" class=\"wp-image-212335\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10105817/yuva-hunkar.jpg?fit=300%2C186\" data-attachment-id=\"212335\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10105817/yuva-hunkar.jpg?resize=1160%2C718&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212316/yuva-hunkar-rally-youth-leaders-modi-govt/jignesh-mevani-rally-3/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10105817/yuva-hunkar.jpg?fit=1024%2C633\" alt=\"\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">New Delhi: Dalit leader and Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani during Youth Hunkar rally in New Delhi on Tuesday.

How do you plan to appeal to the Assamese middle-class? </strong></p>\n<p>As much as 20% of Assam today comprises the lower middle-class, which is not a small percentage of people. The basic problem is, since the modern Assamese community is a newly created one, the middle-class is pretty fragile; they are greedy, hungry. As there is no great industry in the state and it is dependent on central funds, the middle-class is weak. They try to run their lives by having an understanding with Delhi and Dispur as much as possible. They usually don’t challenge the state unless they are in real trouble. Also, if the middle-class realises that the state is more powerful, it tends to not stand with people’s movements. The same has been happening in Assam.</p>\n<p>However, now that the BJP has created such a state in Assam that the Assamese sub-nationalism is about to be demolished, is in danger, I feel that the middle-class will come together with the working-class people, such as the farmers, the tea garden and other labourers. If they can’t, then the independence of the Assamese people as a community, their dignity, won’t be protected. Their voice will vanish forever. There has to be a united front now.</p>\n<p><strong>There has been a signature campaign conducted by an organisation, Prabajan Virodhi Manch, in Assam demanding constitutional safeguard for the people and their families named in the 1951 National Register of Citizens (NRC). Its argument is, the ongoing update of the NRC as per the Assam Accord wouldn’t fully help protect the rights of the indigenous people. Do you support it?</strong></p>\n<p>We are opposed to <em>prabajan</em> (migration); we are taking up the issue but if it is looked only from the sieve of religion and as a tool to dominate the genuine Muslim citizens of the state and stems from the RSS-BJP’s communal agenda, we can’t support it.</p>\n<p><strong>You were seen taking part in the Yuva Hunkar rally in Delhi, sharing space with popular youth leaders from outside the region. How much will this help to widen KMSS’s scope as an organisation? </strong></p>\n<p>In the Bharat<em> varsha</em>, those who have believed in class struggle have always downplayed the sub-nationality question. But the rise of the BJP has undoubtedly proven that only the traditional war of class struggle can’t defeat fascism. That is why the questions of the Dalits, the Patels, the minorities, the youth, the Adivasis, the concerns of the journalists, the litterateurs, the activists, have become significant in the country. For instance, look at what young Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/una-dalit-flogging-gujarat-rohith-vemula-narendra-modi-balochistan-kashmir-unrest-2996353/\" title=\"said\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: ‘You take the cow’s tail and give us back our land.’</p>\n<p>So far, the Dalit question has been one of identity but it has now gone to the question of land. Look at the Bhim Army which spoke of only the Dalits. But its youth leader Chandrasekhar Azad now says Dalits plus Muslims. So you see a range of new nationalist movements being built up against fascism. Through our peasants’ movement, we are trying to get together the youth, the poor, the minority. All progressive and democratic forces will have to come together. That is why taking part in the Yuva Hunkar rally in Delhi is a significant moment for KMSS.</p>\n<p><strong>We saw you on a similar national platform during the India Against Corruption movement too. But that didn’t result in a great change in the political sphere. </strong></p>\n<p>Through India Against Corruption – led by Anna Hazare – we tried to start a movement for a better political discourse which failed. There might be two reasons for it. One, Arvind Kejriwal was too quick to take the movement to electoral politics. He took many decisions on his own, not in a very democratic manner. It affected the movement. Secondly, Anna<em>ji</em>’s political depth was lacking. He is also getting old and can’t concentrate much in terms of the day-to-day dedication it requires. However, now we have got an opportunity to revive that movement, to form a new united front against the BJP’s divisionary politics. We will try, in the 2019 parliamentary elections, and particularly in the 2021 Assam assembly elections to consolidate our efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>You too formed a party in 2015 (Gana Mukti Sangram Asom) but it didn’t contest elections. So do we now see you getting into electoral politics in 2019 or 2021? </strong></p>\n<p>Many would know that we resisted venturing into electoral politics even though we remained under a lot of pressure. However, at a time when the BJP-RSS is trying to create a fascist state by capturing power, we need to venture into electoral politics. If the nationalist forces don’t unite through people’s movements, it will be very difficult to resist the BJP-RSS from taking over the Indian state. That is why there is a lot of pressure on us to enter politics and contest elections. We are actively considering the question. May be you will see us in the 2021 Assam assembly elections.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212527/assam-bjp-akhil-gogoi/\">We May Contest the 2021 Assam Assembly Polls: Peasant Leader Akhil Gogoi</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

It is a battle for the reclamation of human personality – B.R. Ambedkar, in 1942</em></p>\n<p>Puranic lore and mythologies have held sway over the Hindu mind for quite some time. Hindutva is just a new manifestation of this same desire, for a return to the mythical dystopian time of Parashurama – the angry brahmin who killed his own mother to uphold dharma, slaughtered all kshatriya men, disembowelled pregnant kshatriya women, and got brahmin men to cohabit with the (remaining) widows, hoping to exterminate the kshatriya ‘race’, quite like the Hindutva forces set out to do with Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. This figure is the mascot of a sectarian brahmin organisation in Maharashtra today. The <a href=\"http://www.brahmanmahasangh.org/\" title=\"Akhil Bhartiya Brahman Mahasangh\" target=\"_blank\">Akhil Bhartiya Brahman Mahasangh</a>, whose logo features the axe-wielding Parashurama, called the nearly five lakh dalits who congregated at Bhima Koregaon on January 1 anti-national. In concurrence, the government of Maharashtra, led by its brahmin chief minister, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bhima-koregaon-protests-fir-against-umar-khalid-and-jignesh-mevani-in-pune-their-mumbai-event-stopped-5012237/\" title=\"filed FIRs\" target=\"_blank\">filed FIRs</a> against Jignesh Mevani and Umar Khalid for their speeches at Shaniwarwada, near Koregaon.</p>\n<p>It has taken a riot, some violence, a death and a bandh for the non-dalits to wake up this new year to certain aspects of history that appear both curious and troublesome. In histories – even those written by scholars who imagine they are secular, independent-minded and objective – the 1857 revolt, the Dandi salt march, the Quit India movement, the Battle of Haldighati, the story of Laxmibai of Jhansi and suchlike, occupy a place of pride. They have come to be part of our collective memory. However, the 1818 Battle of Bhima Koregaon, or the series of struggles anchored by Ambedkar at Mahad in 1927 (culminating on December 25 with the ceremonial burning of a copy of the hierarchy-endorsing <em>Manusmriti</em>), will not be known to most people. At Mahad, three thousand dalits had assembled March 20 to not just draw water from the temple tank but to “establish the norm of equality” as Ambedkar saw it.</p>\n<p><strong>Ayyankali, Gandhi, Shantaben</strong></p>\n<p>It will also not be known to many that Ayyankali (1863-1941) made history in 1893 by merely <a href=\"http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9233&catid=129&Itemid=195\" title=\"riding in his willuvandi\" target=\"_blank\">riding in his willuvandi</a> (bullock cart); defying the powerful nairs and brahmins, this pulaya pioneer rode the cart on the Rajaveedi (royal path) in Travancore, a road proscribed for untouchables like him. He famously wore a dhoti and an upper garment, rounding the attire off with a stylised turban and an angavasthram wrapped around his shoulder. This, at a time, when the very shadow of a pulaya was said to pollute.</p>\n<p>The same year, 1893, we have the fabled story chronicling the beginnings of M.K. Gandhi’s political career and his spiritual epiphany, when he was thrown off a first-class compartment of a train in Pietermaritzburg. He was 24, and trained in law. However, his resistance in faraway South Africa arose not from a desire of equality for all but from the belief that it was wrong to “degrade the Indian to the position of the kaffir”. In other words, he did not want to sit with the ‘lowly’ blacks in a third-class compartment, but with the whites in first-class.</p>\n<p>Two years later, when he realised that the Durban post office had two entrances, one for blacks and one for whites, instead of demanding one common entrance, Gandhi launched a satyagraha for a third entrance for Indians so that they did not have to use the same entrance as the blacks—and he succeeded. To win over the whites, as Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed have argued in <em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/11027/the-complicated-history-of-the-south-african-gandhi/\" title=\"The South African Gandhi: Stretch-Bearer of Empire\" target=\"_blank\">The South African Gandhi: Stretch-Bearer of Empire</a></em>, Gandhi cited Max Müller and Schopenhauer and argued that whites and high-caste Indians both “spring from common stock, called the Indo-Aryan” (of course excluding the mostly untouchable indentured labour from this imagined racialised nationality).</p>\n<p>Unlike Gandhi’s dubious narrative of victimhood, what Ayyankali did in 1893 was as momentous as what Rosa Parks was to do in Montgomery in 1955. Thousands of nameless dalits, over centuries, have likewise stood up every day against injustice. We just have not had the inclination nor made the effort to know these stories and learn from them. Here’s one I was fortunate enough to bear witness to.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020607/Shantaben-Parmar.jpg?fit=2448%2C3264\" data-orig-size=\"2448,3264\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020607/Shantaben-Parmar.jpg?fit=225%2C300\" data-attachment-id=\"212651\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020607/Shantaben-Parmar.jpg?resize=1160%2C1547&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212652/atrocities-nationalism-offer-history-lessons-beyond-bhima-koregaon/shantaben-parmar/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020607/Shantaben-Parmar.jpg?fit=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Shantaben-Parmar\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212651\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shantaben Parmar, 2009. Credit: S. Anand</p></div>\n<p>In October 2009, I met Shantaben Parmar, then 72, in Bakrawadi, a dalit settlement in Baroda city, who said that when she was 13 years old she defied the unwritten law in her school and drank water from the common water pot, from which all the non-dalit students drank. When the authorities objected, she smashed the pot, saying she’d rather not have anyone quench their thirst if she had to go thirsty. She too made history.</p>\n<p>If you go by what’s reported from across India today, little has changed—dalit children are <a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-8-teachers-held-for-forcing-dalit-students-to-clean-toilets-2079878\" title=\"routinely asked to clean the school toilets\" target=\"_blank\">routinely asked to clean the school toilets</a>; in one case, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU98OmERlxk\" title=\"dalit teacher\" target=\"_blank\">dalit teacher</a> was asked to do the same by a principal. For dalits, quite often, life every single day is an insurrection against the Hindu social order, a posture of alertness and defiance against an imminent atrocity or humiliation. It is only at places like Bhima Koregaon, Deekhsabhoomi and Chaitya Bhoomi, and at scores of such sites that have come up across India, that dalits can be themselves in public. Such a reclamation of human personality by dalits is largely seen as an affront by caste Hindus. The assertive dalit – she could be a branch manager in an office, a schoolteacher, a Buddhist nun, or a sweeper who applies for leave from work to attend the 1 January function at Koregaon – immediately becomes a militant, and is criminalised both by the Brahman Mahasanghs and the state that accuses the much persecuted <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211919/fir-kabir-kala-manch-members-others-promoting-enmity-bhima-koregaon-event/\" title=\"Kabir Kala Manch\" target=\"_blank\">Kabir Kala Manch</a> of promoting enmity. And there are a million Ambedkars today reclaiming history using reason, experience and emotion – these are not puranic fables.</p>\n<p><strong>Educating and humanising the non-Dalits</strong></p>\n<p>What little education non-dalits have gained over the past decades owes to dalit efforts to <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/educate-agitate-organise-the-dalit-student-won-t-be-silenced/story-i8yYMSZnA2SdKfTnNoitOM.html\" title=\"‘educate, agitate and organise’\" target=\"_blank\">‘educate, agitate and organise’</a> the rest of society about the repressed aspects of a history that both have been a part of. In the past decade, fuelled by the social media boom, independent dalit initiatives from across the globe have variously amplified the ‘educate, agitate and organise’ Ambedkarite mantra with the observance of <a href=\"https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/423929/Dalit-History-Month/\" title=\"Dalit History Month\" target=\"_blank\">Dalit History Month</a> every April (modelled on the black American tradition of observing February as Black History Month). Dalit Lives Matter is also a similar, serious ongoing campaign.</p>\n<p>The largely dalit-free corporate media today is more accommodative of such news, perhaps recognising the new demographic of readership it has come to have. This inevitability has been enforced upon non-dalits by decades of sensitisation that dalits have resiliently and quietly advanced, often lacking the resources and inherited assets that non-dalits can boast of. <em>The Indian Express</em> in 2016 carried a feature on these new platforms. Likewise, we saw Scroll, which has been around for four years, report the Bhima Koregaon event the past two years from the field. It ran a <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/801298/why-lakhs-of-people-celebrate-the-british-victory-over-the-maratha-peshwas-every-new-year\" title=\"long report\" target=\"_blank\">long report</a> in 2016 on the commemoration that has been happening at Bhima Koregaon for decades. The same writer in 2017 <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/863605/maratha-counter-rally-in-punes-bhima-koregaon-turns-violent-as-residents-say-they-were-attacked-too\" title=\"reported\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> how people with saffron flags and shirts were seen attacking people with blue flags and cars with blue signs—this was shot on camera. This year, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/tag/bhima-koregaon/\" title=\"The Wire\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a> and <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212476/seychelles-slow-removing-hurdles-indias-assumption-island-project-leader-opposition/\" title=\"The Print\" target=\"_blank\">The Print</a> and several online news platforms carried extensive essays and reports that showed sensitivity to the dalit point of view.</p>\n<p>Yet most media houses do not think it is their responsibility to introspect on whether dalits work as reporters and decision-makers in their midst. Like Sudipto Mondal wrote in a scathing piece last year, the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/05/indian-media-dalit-news-dalit-reporters-170523194045529.html\" title=\"“Indian media wants Dalit news but not Dalit reporters”\" target=\"_blank\">“Indian media wants Dalit news but not Dalit reporters”</a>: “Indian journalism is so mind-numbingly upper-caste that the mere act of ‘coming out’ by journalist Yashica Dutt was celebrated as a milestone in the quest for caste diversity.”</p>\n<p>Till a few years ago the ‘national’ media and most of non-dalit society turned their faces away from events such as Bhima Koregaon, just as much as history books excluded facts that disturbed their ‘nationalist’ grand narratives. Some <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/817737/ten-years-after-khairlanji-only-retaliatory-violence-can-dislodge-the-deep-rooted-venom-of-caste\" title=\"ten years ago, when the Khairlanji atrocity happened\" target=\"_blank\">ten years ago, when the Khairlanji atrocity happened</a> – on 29 September 2006, Surekha Bhotmange and her daughter were mass raped and put to death, along with Surekha’s two sons Roshan and Sudhir, as the entire village of Marathas watched – the ‘national’ media took a month to report the ‘story’. And it took a white American intern at <em>Times of India</em>’s Mumbai edition to travel and file the first report in the ‘mainstream’ English language media. “Just another Rape Story” by Sabrina Buckwalter (<a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Just-another-rape-story/articleshow/222682.cms\" title=\"The Times of India\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Times of India</em></a>, 29 October 2006) is still worth a read.</p>\n<p>The Central government, then headed by the Congress-led UPA, created visa issues for Buckwalter, and she had to head back to her country. Buckwalter later told the website <a href=\"https://atrocitynews.wordpress.com/2007/09/25/a-story-full-of-hatred-american-experience-of-castevirus/\" title=\"Atrocity News\" target=\"_blank\">Atrocity News</a>, “A police officer from the Mumbai police station even showed up unannounced at <em>The Times of India</em> office, to serve me official paperwork informing me the Government of India had instructed me to leave within five days and that my visa appeal was denied.”</p>\n<p>Was Khairlanji-as-news an <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5gj33x/why-a-white-girl-writing-about-rape-got-kicked-out-of-india\" title=\"American conspiracy\" target=\"_blank\">American conspiracy</a>, Arnab Goswami and his many clones may want the nation to know. Much has changed since 2006, despite the racket news anchors habitually make over the inconveniences of a bandh.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambedkar on the British empire</strong></p>\n<p>The right-wing opposition to dalits commemorating what ostensibly is imperialist Britain’s victory over a feudal and brahminical regime at Bhima Koregaon gives us an opportunity to consider how someone like Ambedkar viewed such events in history. In <a href=\"http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/49.%20The%20Untouchables%20and%20the%20Pax%20Britannica.htm\" title=\"“The Untouchables and the Pax Britannica”\" target=\"_blank\">“The Untouchables and the Pax Britannica”</a>, an unfinished book-length essay likely written in the 1930s in the wake of the Round Table Conferences (but published only posthumously), he says that after the Battle of Plassey, “the last battle which completed the [British] territorial conquest was fought in 1818. It is known as the Battle of Koregaon. This was the battle which destroyed the Maratha Empire and established in its place the British Empire in India.”</p>\n<p>In another of his fragmentary works, “Waiting for a Visa”, Ambedkar writes of his father Ramji Sakpal and grandfather Maloji Sakpal:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“From the very commencement of the rule of the East India Company, my forefathers had left their hereditary occupation for service in the Army of the Company. My father also followed the family tradition and sought service in the Army. He rose to the rank of an officer, and was a Subedar when he retired.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>On 1 January 1927, the year that later witnessed the Mahad revolt, Ambedkar visited the Koregaon memorial at the behest of Shivram Janba Kamble, the pioneering senior mahar leader of the Pune region who began mobilizing mahars to commemorate the obelisk at Koregaon. In 1910, Kamble organised a conference of mahars from 51 villages in the western region. By then, the British had stopped recruiting mahars to their armies. Kamble, and others before him, had been lobbying for the reinstatement of the Mahar Regiment.</p>\n<p>Ambedkar chastises the British for neglecting the interests of the untouchables who had often stood by them. After arguing how it would be “true to say that the Untouchables not only helped the British to conquer India they helped them to retain India”, he asks:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“How have the British treated the Untouchables so far as service in the Army is concerned? Strange as it may appear, the answer is that the British Government has since about 1890 placed a ban on the recruitment of the Untouchables in the Indian Army. The result was that, those who had already been recruited remained. It is a great mercy that they were not disbanded. But in course of time they died or went on pension and ultimately by about 1910 completely disappeared from the Army. Nothing can be more ungrateful than this exclusion of the Untouchables from the Army.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The historian of the Ambedkarite movement Eleanor Zelliot writes in <a href=\"https://navayana.org/products/ambedkars-world/\" title=\"Ambedkar’s World: The Making of Babasaheb and the Dalit Movement\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ambedkar’s World: The Making of Babasaheb and the Dalit Movement</em></a>, that the mahars had been heavily recruited into the Bombay Army of the English East India Company. This tradition of service-in-arms was disrupted by the British government in 1894 – owing to the rise of the ‘martial races’ theory, which altered military priority towards the recruitment of privileged caste groups into the British Army. A mahar battalion was raised during the First World War, only to be disbanded in 1921. It was only in 1940 that mahar recruits were regularised in the army, partly as a result of Ambedkar’s lobbying with the colonial government.</p>\n<p>Answering the detractors of his time – and anticipating the Arun Shouries, Brahmin Mahasanghs and Fadnavises to come – Ambedkar spells out clearly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There are many who look upon this conduct of the Untouchables in joining the British as an act of gross treason. Treason or no treason, this act of the Untouchables was quite natural. History abounds with illustrations showing how one section of people in a Country have shown sympathy with an invader, in the hope that the new comer will release them from the oppressions of their countrymen.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Had he been around today, Ambedkar would surely have been called an anti-national and booked for sedition with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah leading the chorus. There’s much in history, and in the unfolding present, that disturbs and unsettles nationalist anxieties. Here’s another story.</p>\n<p><strong>Rather a white man than a brahmin as judge</strong></p>\n<p>In 1878, the immediate provocation for the founding of <em>The Hindu</em>, as a weekly magazine by six brahmins of Madras, was the criticism by the British newspapers of the appointment of T. Muthuswamy Aiyar, a brahmin, to the bench of the Madras high court. <em>The Hindu</em>’s founding claim, though, was that it represented the “feelings of natives”. This was essentially a cover for brahmin interests, says <a href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/reluctant-electoralist-poet-vck-leader-ravikumar-politics-literature-and-his-16-contest\" title=\"Ravikumar,\" target=\"_blank\">Ravikumar,</a> public intellectual and general secretary of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi in Tamil Nadu. In an important essay that documents how dalits had pioneered the culture of journalism in the Tamil-speaking areas of Madras Presidency, “The Unwritten Writing: Dalits and the Media” (in the volume <em>21st Century Journalism in India</em> edited by Nalini Rajan, 2007), he writes: “The opinions of the untouchables, who too were ‘natives’, were not similar to those of the founders of <em>The Hindu</em>. They felt that people like Muthuswamy Aiyar should not be given the position of a judge.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11022818/iyothee-thass-and-tamilan.jpg?fit=2000%2C1200\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1200\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11022818/iyothee-thass-and-tamilan.jpg?fit=300%2C180\" data-attachment-id=\"212654\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11022818/iyothee-thass-and-tamilan.jpg?resize=1160%2C696&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212652/atrocities-nationalism-offer-history-lessons-beyond-bhima-koregaon/iyothee-thass-and-tamilan/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11022818/iyothee-thass-and-tamilan.jpg?fit=1024%2C614\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"iyothee-thass-and-tamilan\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212654\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Iyothee Thass and his <em>One Pice Tamilian. </em>Credit: routesblog.com</p></div>\n<p>Ravikumar, who recently <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/dark-history-pariah-caste-legacy\" title=\"challenged the casual use of the word ‘pariah’\" target=\"_blank\">challenged the casual use of the word ‘pariah’</a> by <em>Time </em>magazine and often by the Indian media, draws our attention to how the pioneer of the dalit movement in Madras Presidency, Iyothee Thass (1845–1914), regarded such developments. Thass, who in 1907 launched the newspaper <em>Oru Paisa Tamilan</em>, featured a news-cum-opinion item in 1908 entitled, “Power of District Magistrate for Indians”. Arguing that such positions should not be given to brahmins, the report says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The self-styled Brahmins migrated to this country from alien lands… If we give the power of District Magistrate to these people, they will employ the people of their caste and cheat common Hindus. There will be endless troubles if high positions are given to those who call themselves ‘higher caste’ .… They regard even the British as inferior to them. They don’t have intellectual, physical, economic or even numerical strength. They have only the strength that comes from calling themselves people of high caste.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, Ravikumar concludes: “This statement of Thass, and the consistent stance taken by <em>Parayan</em> [another dalit-run journal] on such issues, leads us to infer that the untouchables would certainly not have supported Aiyar’s appointment as a judge.”</p>\n<p>Ambedkar, too, had reason to think along similar lines. In June 1927, after five orthodox Hindus, who were part of a mob that attacked the dalits at Mahad, were sentenced by the (colonial) district magistrate to four months’ rigorous imprisonment, he said: “Had the chief officers in the district been Hindus, justice would have been denied. Under Brahmin Peshwa rule I would have been trampled to death by an elephant.”</p>\n<p>In the Indian judiciary, according to a CSDS study cited in 2007 by <a href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/brahmins-in-india/234783\" title=\"Outlook\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Outlook</em></a>, 47 per cent of all Supreme Court chief justices between 1950 and 2000 were brahmins, who constitute a mere 3% of the population.</p>\n<p>If Ambedkar and many dalits sought to strategically gain from the presence of the British empire, and saw it a more benign force compared to the brutal Peshwa-brahminism – which forced untouchables in the region to tie a broom to their waists to sweep away their footprints, and hang spittoons around their necks to collect their saliva – Gandhi, as late as in October 1920, had this to say of the same empire:</p>\n<p>“I put my life in peril four times for the cause of the empire – at the time of the Boer War when I was in charge of the Ambulance Corps whose work was mentioned in General Buller’s dispatches, at the time of the Zulu revolt in Natal when I was in charge of a similar corps, at the time of the commencement of the late war when I raised an Ambulance Corps and as a result of the strenuous training had a severe attack of pleurisy, and, lastly, in fulfilment of my promise to Lord Chelmsford at the War Conference in Delhi, I threw myself in such an active recruiting campaign in Kheda district involving long and trying marches, that I had an attack of dysentery which proved almost fatal. I did all these in the belief that acts such as mine must gain for my country an equal status in the empire.”</p>\n<p>If history is a contest for power and supremacy for both Gandhi and the brahminic-Peshwai forces that assassinated him, for dalits the principal object of history has been the pursuit of equality and justice, a battle for freedom and the reclamation of their human personality. The battle against caste is as much a battle of ideas and identities. If the non-dalits use this historic opportunity to humanise themselves, the Battle of Bhima Koregaon II of 1 January 2018 will have served some purpose.</p>\n<p><em>The author is publisher, Navayana</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212652/atrocities-nationalism-offer-history-lessons-beyond-bhima-koregaon/\">The Atrocities of Nationalism Offer History Lessons Beyond Bhima Koregaon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters/Thomas Peter</p></div>\n<p>Soft power is the ability of a country to shape other countries’ views, attitudes, perceptions and actions without force or coercion. Its importance has been acknowledged for centuries, though the term was only <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2004-05-01/soft-power-means-success-world-politics\" title=\"coined\" target=\"_blank\">coined</a> by American political scientist and author Joseph Nye in the late 1980s.</p>\n<p>A country’s soft power depends on many factors, including its performance, global image and international reputation. A state can use soft power to attract supporters and partners towards its policies, views and actions.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, the case of China’s giant pandas.</p>\n<p>In 685 AD <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/14/china.conservation\" title=\"Empress Wu Zetian\" target=\"_blank\">Empress Wu Zetian</a> of the Tang Dynasty presented two giant pandas to the Japanese emperor. More than a millennium later, in 1941, Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek gifted another pair to the Bronx Zoo in appreciation of the US’s wartime help. Pandas remain a hallmark of Chinese soft power <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a04a532-be92-11e7-9836-b25f8adaa111\" title=\"even today\" target=\"_blank\">even today</a>.</p>\n<p>These animals have become symbols of China’s efforts in wildlife preservation and environmental protection. They are a way for China to communicate a caring and genial approach and culture.</p>\n<p>And soft power will remain a key strategy for China into the coming decades. In October 2017, at the governing party’s national congress, President Xi Jinping <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-southchinasea/chinas-xi-strikes-conciliatory-note-broadens-diplomatic-focus-idUSKCN0JE04J20141130\" title=\"outlined steps\" target=\"_blank\">outlined steps</a> to enhance China’s soft power and make its culture more globally appealing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will improve our capacity for engaging in international communication so as to tell China’s stories well, present a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China, and enhance our country’s soft power.</p></blockquote>\n<p>China is stepping into a soft power vacuum created by the US’s new administration. Since Donald Trump was elected president, the US has eschewed soft power. It’s withdrawn from a global climate change agreement; renegotiating a number of bilateral treaties and taken an openly “America first”, and somewhat isolationist stance. Its cordial relations with many traditional allies have become strained.</p>\n<p>China has spotted the gap and is attempting to woo many countries whose US relations are wavering. One of China’s key weapons is the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e96e20c-e742-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da\" title=\"One Belt, One Road\" target=\"_blank\">One Belt, One Road</a>” programme, a USD $900 billion initiative that aims to strengthen land and sea transportation links through major investments in transport infrastructure in Asia, Europe and Africa.</p>\n<p>This is the equivalent of the US’s <a href=\"http://marshallfoundation.org/marshall/the-marshall-plan/history-marshall-plan/\" title=\"Marshall plan\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall plan</a>, which significantly improved West European countries’ economies after World War II. This help was not altruistic; nor is China’s “One Belt, One Road” programme. Assisting other nations through economic growth is a way of wielding soft power and advancing a country’s global standing. This will be important for China, which needs to counter its reputation as a one party state with hegemonic intentions.</p>\n<p><strong>How soft power has featured</strong></p>\n<p>China’s <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/45124/1/601791185.pdf\" title=\"economic success\" target=\"_blank\">economic success</a>, massive <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/sierens-china-speeding-ahead-of-the-rest-of-the-world/a-40303445\" title=\"infrastructural development\" target=\"_blank\">infrastructural development</a>, academic and research progress, cultural heritage and success in sports will continue to increase its soft power in the future.</p>\n<p>Culture and tourism are always important aspects of soft power. Some 138 million tourists visited China in 2016, a <a href=\"https://www.travelchinaguide.com/tourism/2016statistics/inbound.htm\" title=\"growth of 3.5%\" target=\"_blank\">growth of 3.5%</a> over 2015</p>\n<p>Similarly, 122 million Chinese visitors <a href=\"https://www.travelchinaguide.com/tourism/2016statistics/outbound.htm\" title=\"went abroad\" target=\"_blank\">went abroad</a> in 2016, a growth of 4.3% over 2015. This increasing interchange of the visitors will give foreigners an insight into Chinese culture, history and its economic might – all of which will further enhance China’s soft power.</p>\n<p>China is also emerging as a global leader in terms of academic and research progress. High income countries’ share of global research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/how_much_do_countries_invest_in_rd_new_unesco_data_tool_re/\" title=\"fell\" target=\"_blank\">fell</a> from 88% to 69.3% between 1996 and 2013.</p>\n<p>China alone filled this gap. It increased <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/how_much_do_countries_invest_in_rd_new_unesco_data_tool_re/\" title=\"its share\" target=\"_blank\">its share</a> from a paltry 2.5% to 19.6% in 17 years. Recently, China’s average annual R&amp;D expenditure growth has been 18.3%, compared to an anaemic growth rate in upper and middle income countries of 1.4%.</p>\n<p>Increased educational and research activities have ensured that the number of foreign students in China is <a href=\"https://chinapower.csis.org/china-international-students/\" title=\"increasing rapidly\" target=\"_blank\">increasing rapidly</a>. China now ranks third in attracting foreign students, after the US and UK. Its universities are <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-china\" title=\"climbing the global rankings\" target=\"_blank\">climbing the global rankings</a>. This, along with rapid internationalisation, policies that support foreign students, and affordability of study and living costs compared to the West, means China could soon become the top destination for international students.</p>\n<p>And the reverse is also true. Of some <a href=\"http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170530122432533\" title=\"five million\" target=\"_blank\">five million</a> international students pursuing higher education outside their countries, nearly 25% are Chinese. It’s another form of cultural interchange that will contribute to China’s soft power, as are the many <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chinas-confucius-institutes-arent-perfect-but-have-much-to-offer-africa-51596\" title=\"Confucius Institutes\" target=\"_blank\">Confucius Institutes</a> set up around the world to showcase China’s culture, history, language, economic and social development.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average rate is about 25%. The US rate of 21% would be one of the most attractive tax rates on corporate income amongst all major economies, and certainly among the sought-after investment destinations. Investment decisions of multinational enterprises with the ability to locate operations in a destination of their choosing will surely favour the US, if this tax plan is implemented.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10135822/image11.png?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10135822/image11.png?fit=600%2C378\" data-orig-size=\"600,378\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10135822/image11.png?fit=300%2C189\" data-attachment-id=\"212478\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Source:  EY Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide &lt;/p&gt;\n\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10135822/image11.png?resize=733%2C462&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212475/budget-2018-india-improve-corporate-income-tax-regime/image11/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10135822/image11.png?fit=600%2C378\" alt=\"Source: EY Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide \" data-image-title=\"image11\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212478\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: EY Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide</p></div>\n<p><span>The impact on developing countries with weak investment climates – such as India – who need to attract foreign direct investment to their shores can be severe. India already offers huge tax incentives to multinational companies in a bid to attract investors, losing much-needed tax revenues. If drawn into a competitive tax war, India may need to make further concessions if it is to offset the reductions in tax rates in the US, putting further pressure on tax revenues.</span></p>\n<p><span>The consequences to the investment-GDP ratio in India could be significant. Already, the gross fixed capital formation statistic continues to decline year after year. It has come down from a high of 37% of GDP in 2007-08 to 28.9% for Q2 of 2017-18 (as per the CSO Press Release of November 30, 2017). The Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) <a href=\"https://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=warticle&dt=2018-01-01%2016:06:58&msec=306\" title=\"reports that new investment proposals\" target=\"_blank\">reports that new investment proposals</a> are likely to stabilise around Rs 8 trillion in 2017-18 which, would be about 60% of the new proposals made during 2016-17 and would be the lowest level since 2004-05. This would be the third consecutive year of a fall in new investments since they spiked momentarily in 2014-15, the difference is that the fall in 2017-18 would be sharper than in earlier years. In this context, a sharp reduction in corporate tax rates in a large, attractive investment destination like the US could have a further negative impact on India’s competitiveness. The economic uncertainty to the investment climate in India <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/97981/investment-climate-demonetisation/\" title=\"caused by demonetisation\" target=\"_blank\">caused by demonetisation</a> and the shabby design and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) does not help.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211608/budget-2018-rural-distress/\" title=\"Budget 2018: Centre Must Tackle Unfulfilled Promises, Rural Distress as It Walks Fiscal Tightrope\" target=\"_blank\">Budget 2018: Centre Must Tackle Unfulfilled Promises, Rural Distress as It Walks Fiscal Tightrope</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The consequences for tax revenues would also be significant. While the value-added tax (VAT) and other indirect taxes are now the mainstay of revenues in the OECD and developed countries, corporate income taxes still contribute over 30% to the total central government revenues in India. And if India is forced to cut corporate tax rates or offer huge tax sops to attract investment, corporate tax revenues will be hit. India already has a low tax-GDP ratio of around 16-17%, roughly half the OECD average of 34%.</span></p>\n<p><span>The finance minister needs to begin to think of strategies to counter the negative impact of a tax war on business taxation.

India started out with an overly complex, poorly-designed GST, which has dampened investor sentiment and created tremendous compliance burdens on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The administration on its part has found administering the GST a challenge, and ad hoc changes in the tax slabs applicable to commodities has not helped. The finance minister <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211753/can-budget-2018-set-road-map-make-gst-truly-good-simple-tax/\" title=\"needs to announce a roadmap\" target=\"_blank\">needs to announce a roadmap</a> to a simpler, more efficient GST regime, with no more than three rate slabs and a high threshold so SMEs are spared the burden of complying with an onerous tax. Jaitley must also figure out how to help states build capacity to improve recovery and reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers. This will not only help improve the business climate but also lead to higher revenues.</span></p>\n<p><span>Second, to revive the investment climate, the finance minister needs to do only one thing – act on his own promise made in his very first budget of 2015-16, i.e., that he will eliminate most tax incentives and put in place a flat 25% tax rate. (Perhaps now that the US will have a 21% rate, even a lower rate may need to be considered for India). Given that there exist a range of tax incentives, there is limited room to reduce the headline tax rate due to revenue considerations. The fact is, while the headline tax rate is 30%, with the various cesses and surcharges, the actual headline rate is 34.61%, or almost 35%. However, most large companies can employ the services of tax lawyers and accountants and – using the various tax incentives – get the tax liability down to close to the effective CIT rate of 23 or 24%. The end result? India gives out a signal of being a “high tax” economy, but ends up with low revenues owing to tax incentives.</span></p>\n<p><span>Getting rid of tax incentives will also signal a level playing field to SMEs who are less able to employ tax professionals to help them plan their businesses in a way that helps them reduce their tax liabilities.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is important to point out that tax incentives are hardly ever a guaranteed means to attract investment. To achieve that, the finance minister has to focus on real factors such as improving infrastructure, fixing the banks and ensuring India lives up to its image of an open, multicultural, secular, free democracy. </span></p>\n<p><span>In case CIT reforms do lead to potential revenues losses, the finance minister needs to look at how revenues could be increased from other direct tax instruments, such as the personal income tax and the property tax. In India, personal income taxes constitute just about 2% of GDP, whereas the OECD average is 8.5% of GDP. Property tax is one of the least utilised tax instruments in the developing world, with India collecting less than even half a percent of GDP. There is potential to increase tax revenues here, given that countries like the UK and the US collect over 3% of GDP from this tax.  </span></p>\n<p><span>Another option is for the finance minister to focus more on excises. Some excises have positive externalities, apart from raising revenues: there are health gains to be had by increasing the taxation of tobacco products, for example, apart from greater tax revenues. Carbon taxes can increase revenues while limiting carbon emissions. Taxes on fuels also serve the same dual purpose.</span></p>\n<p><em><span><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/rajul-awasthi/\" title=\"Rajul Awasthi\" target=\"_blank\">Rajul Awasthi</a> works for the World Bank on tax reforms.

Credit: IPS</p></div>\n<p><span><strong>Ottawa, Canada:</strong> </span> If there is one political principle that has been constant throughout the history of human civilisation it is the fact that land is power. This is something that is particularly true and often painfully so, for women who farm in Africa.<br>\n<span></span></p>\n<p>Though women in Africa are far more likely to farm than men, they are also much less likely to have secure rights to the land where they cultivate crops and they typically hold smaller plots of inferior quality.</p>\n<p>As a researcher who studies the role of gender in agriculture, I want to do my part to address this injustice, because when women have <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/blog/four-things-you-need-know-about-womens-land-rights\" title=\"stronger rights to land\" target=\"_blank\">stronger rights to land</a>, their crop yields increase and they have higher incomes and more bargaining power within the household. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3657746/\" title=\"Research\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> has shown that stronger land rights leads to other benefits such as better child nutrition and improved educational attainment for girls.</p>\n<p>But as I delve deeper in to the issue, I frequently encounter another political constant, which is the fact that information is power. And one manifestation of the chronic neglect of women in agriculture is the lack of data that would help illuminate and address their plight.</p>\n<p>For example, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has launched the <a href=\"http://www.globalgoals.org/goalkeepers/datareport/\" title=\"Goal Keepers Initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Goal Keepers Initiative</a>, which is making a concerted effort to track progress toward achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Examining the first ever report on the program launched just a few weeks ago, the first thing I did was scroll down to the section on Goal 5, “Achieve Gender Equality and Empower all Women and Girls.” When examining the indicators related to gender, which include tracking the percentage of women who have secured land rights, I kept encountering the phrase, “Insufficient data” in big, bold red capital letters!</p>\n<p>Without data, it is impossible to track progress or identify policies and interventions that are achieving gender equality. In order to develop solutions – whether around land rights or the many other challenges women and girls face – we need data that highlights current problems and assesses their impact.</p>\n<p>A good example of how sex-specific data fosters progress is in financial inclusion. Sex-specific data gives us information about who is accessing which kind of products, which channels they use and what the gaps are. Being aware of these gaps is essential to overcome them and this is impossible without data sets for both men and women. In Rwanda, <a href=\"http://opendatacon.org/sex-disaggregated-data-a-means-towards-gender-equality/\" title=\"use of sex-specific data\" target=\"_blank\">use of sex-specific data</a> has led to the targeting of groups who are excluded from the financial system, raising the financial inclusion index rise from 20% in 2008 to 42% in 2012.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Data2X_MappingGenderDataGaps_FullReport.pdf\" title=\"report\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by Data2X, an initiative of the UN Foundation, indicates that although close to 80% of countries globally regularly produce sex-specific statistics on mortality, labor force participation and education and training, less than one-third of countries separate statistics by sex on informal employment, entrepreneurship (ownership and management of a firm or business) and unpaid work, or collect data about violence against women. This leads to an incomplete picture of women’s and men’s lives and the gaps that persist between them, which constrains the development of policies and programs to address these gaps.</p>\n<p>A key challenge to collecting these data sets is investment. We need financial investments to collect data on the situation of women and girls at different levels – local, national and international. A <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/gender/using-data-to-measure-gender-equality.html\" title=\"study\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> carried out by the UN Statistics Division in collaboration with the UN regional commissions in 2012, showed that out of 126 responding countries only 13% had a separate budget allocated to specific gender statistics, 47% relied on ad-hoc or project funds and the remaining 39% had no funds at all.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2016/05/Gates-Foundation-Announces-80-Mill-Doll-Comm-Closing-Gender-Data-Gaps-Acc-Progress-for-Women-Girls\" title=\"invested US $80M\" target=\"_blank\">invested US $80M</a> to improve the collection of sex specific data. In Uganda, the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2016/05/09/more-and-better-gender-data-a-powerful-tool-for-improving-lives\" title=\"World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study</a> is collaborating with the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/edge/\" title=\"UN Evidence and Data for Gender Equality initiative\" target=\"_blank\">UN Evidence and Data for Gender Equality initiative</a> and the Uganda Bureau of Statistics to collect and analyze asset ownership by different members of households.</p>\n<p>It would help to know for example what assets women own so as to develop programs and policies that benefit both men and women and that close persistent gender gaps. At <a href=\"https://www.idrc.ca/\" title=\"Canada’s International Development Research Centre\" target=\"_blank\">Canada’s International Development Research Centre</a>, we are supporting sex-specific <a href=\"https://www.idrc.ca/en/initiative/centre-excellence-civil-registration-and-vital-statistics-systems\" title=\"reporting and registration of vital and civil events \" target=\"_blank\">reporting and registration of vital and civil events </a> – including births and deaths to help track progress on such indicators as women’s reproductive health and child mortality.</p>\n<p>Globally, there is still no available data on how many women own customary land. One challenge is that the rules, norms and customs which determine the distribution of land and resources are embedded in various institutions in society – family, kinship, community, markets and states. For example, when I was visiting Mali in 2012, I attended a village’s community meeting where I witnessed the village chief grant a local women’s group a local deed so they could farm together and raise their incomes. But there was no formal document or record.</p>\n<p>Without this data, when land is privatised or formalised, women often lose control of customary land. For example in post-independence Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, during the land registration and formalisation experience, lack of data and <a href=\"https://www.usaidlandtenure.net/issue-brief/land-tenure-property-rights-and-gender/\" title=\"consideration of women in customary land rights\" target=\"_blank\">consideration of women in customary land rights</a> led to the documentation of land in the name of the head of the household only, often a man. This gave the man authority to use, sell and control the land, with women losing the customary access and rights that they had previously enjoyed.</p>\n<p>International agencies and governments must commit to investing in collecting more data on women and girls. Closing this gender data gap is not only useful for tracking progress of where we are with the SDGs, but it can also point to what interventions are working, and what needs to be done to accelerate progress towards gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.</p>\n<p>What gets measured matters and what matters gets measured. Women and girls matter.</p>\n<p><em>(IPS)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212445/leaving-women-and-girls-behind-in-the-data-revolution-is-not-an-option/\">Leaving Women and Girls Behind in the Data Revolution Is Not an Option</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

For the first time in Seychelles’ history, the ruling party, the People’s Party, lost the 2016 parliamentary elections and the majority of seats in the 33-member house went to the opposition coalition, Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS). Therefore, despite the literal definition of his formal designation, Ramkalawan is the leader of the majority of the members in the parliament. Seychelles has a presidential form of government, but parliament has significant powers of oversight.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020544/India-Seychelles.png?fit=675%2C582\" data-orig-size=\"675,582\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020544/India-Seychelles.png?fit=300%2C259\" data-attachment-id=\"212650\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Seychelles&lt;/p&gt;\n\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020544/India-Seychelles.png?resize=675%2C582&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212476/seychelles-slow-removing-hurdles-indias-assumption-island-project-leader-opposition/india-seychelles/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11020544/India-Seychelles.png?fit=675%2C582\" alt=\"Seychelles\" data-image-title=\"India-Seychelles\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seychelles map</p></div>\n<p>India has been looking to consolidate and strengthen its strategic position in the Indian ocean region, especially with China’s growing naval presence and pro-active courting of small island nations. Seychelles’ Assumption, along with Agalega in Mauritius, were two islands in the Indian Ocean that India had committed to develop ‘infrastructure’ in, during Narendra Modi’s visit in 2015. These were supposed to be among the concrete outcomes of India’s revamped strategy for the Indian ocean region, launched as <a href=\"http://www.indiafoundation.in/sagar-indias-vision-for-the-indian-ocean-region/\" title=\"SAGAR\" target=\"_blank\">SAGAR</a>.</p>\n<p>Under Seychelles law, the Assumption island agreement must be ratified bythe  parliament.

Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p>Even as the opposition came on board, there was more delay as the Seychelles government wanted to modify some clauses. These related to the capacity of the military infrastructure that India had committed to build for the Seychelles defence forces. According to Ramkalawan, Seychelles would like to see larger facilities in keeping with the demand of the defence forces, since Assumption island would be the hub to patrol its waters to prevent illegal fishing and drug smuggling in the region. There were also some other technical issues, like the location of the jetty.</p>\n<p>India will also get access to these facilities on the island, strategically located on the southern Indian ocean. However, despite such descriptors used in some media reports, Ramkalawan insisted that Assumption was not a military base for India.</p>\n<p>According to Indian officials, New Delhi is still awaiting the amendments from Seychelles to the agreement. Once they agree on the changes, the amendments would get the approval through an exchange of letters by the two countries. Thereafter, the finalised document will be tabled in the Seychelles parliament.</p>\n<p>Ramkalawan indicated that the agreement would come to parliament by February – with the possibility of earlier passage by the end of this month.</p>\n<p>India has had a very close security relationship with Seychelles, providing training and equipment for its defence forces. New Delhi has provided two patrol boats, one interceptor and a Dornier aircraft to the coast guard. India conducted a hydrographic survey for Seychelles in December 2015. Six coastal radar systems were installed by India. However, three of them were damaged in a recent cyclone, while the other three may also need to be upgraded. The intimacy in this relationship over the years can be easily demonstrated by the fact that in 1986, the then Seychelles president Francis Albert Rene <a href=\"https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/13331/2/Brewster%20Flowers%20are%20Blooming%20Naval%20Review%202011.pdf\" title=\"rushed back home from Zimbabwe on ‘Air India One’\" target=\"_blank\">rushed back home from Zimbabwe on ‘Air India One’</a> loaned by Rajiv Gandhi, after receiving news of a possible coup.</p>\n<p>Seychellois of Indian origin account for over 10% of the total population of 96,000. That’s why Ramkalawan’s current trip to India is even more significant. He is participating in the meeting of parliamentarians of Indian origin, but in a personal milestone, will become the first person from Seychelles who will be travelling back to India to successfully trace their origin.</p>\n<p>As per Mauritian government records, his grandfather, ‘Harrychurn’ left the village of ‘Pursounee’ in Chhapra district in 1883, boarded a ship, the  <em>Shaw Alam,</em> in Kolkata and arrived in Mauritius after a 10 or 12 week journey to work as an indentured labourer. After he died at the age of 48, his wife and two sons migrated to Seychelles.</p>\n<p>With the help of the Indian government, Ramkalawan will be tracing his great-grandfather’s steps back to the village in Bihar this week.</p>\n<p>Here are edited excerpts from Seychelles Leader of Opposition Wavel Ramkalawan’s interview with <em>The Wire</em>:</p>\n<p><strong>What are the reasons for the delay in starting the Assumption Island project? Is it only to do with legal issues?</strong></p>\n<p>They should have foreseen the legal issues and dealt with them. For example, when the prime minister came to Seychelles, the ruling party had an absolute majority in the parliament.</p>\n<p>But, (president) James Michel, sort of, did not want to talk about the project.

Given it was a sensitive document, he called me and gave me a copy.</p>\n<p><strong>That was in 2016 and now we are in 2018. Why is it taking so long to get the agreement to the parliament for ratification?</strong></p>\n<p>Our minister of foreign affairs has been very slow. You will be surprised to know that foreign secretary and principal secretary have both been replaced and now hopefully, there will be a new surge of energy so that these things move forward.</p>\n<p>I spoke to the president last night (January 7) and said that things need to happen. Because they were supposed to have happened on December 15 (2017). This was supposed to have been tabled then. But, then the ministry of foreign affairs failed to see sense. Now, we are hoping, because the president in the new year visited Assumption island, along with the attorney general and the head of the military, now hopefully, ratification could be as early as end of this month.</p>\n<p>In the final document, which would need to be signed off by both parties, there will be certain changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Has Seychelles agreed to be part of China’s one belt, one road (OBOR)?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>China must certainly be pushing for Seychelles to be part of its maritime silk road project.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I know.</p>\n<p><strong>What would the opposition’s position be if the Seychelles government agrees to be part of OBOR?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, it will have to be cleared by the parliament. Until I see what the implications are, I will not be able to give you a clear answer. When you talk of military, what is it all about? Is it like… well, we were part of the European Union military cooperation in the fight against piracy. We knew what exactly was in there.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10221416/narendra-modi_759.jpg?fit=759%2C422\" data-orig-size=\"759,422\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10221416/narendra-modi_759.jpg?fit=300%2C167\" data-attachment-id=\"212639\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;PM Narendra Modi unveiling a plaque and operationalisation of radar for the CSRS India-Sychelles Cooperation Project in Mahé, Seychelles, in 2015.

How do you see the power dynamics evolving in the region and India’s role vis-à-vis China?</strong></p>\n<p>When you look at Mauritius, the fact (is) that you have a population that is over 50% Indian origin. There is a natural affinity towards India. Seychelles is the same way. You have a strong Indian base population in Seychelles. The link is there. The same with the Maldives. With Sri Lanka, there have been problems, still there is the connection. Same with the Comoros as well. So, whatever influence China specifically may want to have in the Indian Ocean, it will be totally different from the natural influence that India will have.</p>\n<p>Yes, at the same time, it is not something that we can take for granted.</p>\n<p>Take for example – in Seychelles, China came along and gave us the Supreme Court, the law courts, the national assembly, poly technic and they are also involved in the construction of houses. However, even though they are giving all these things, we know that they are doing so not because of the natural affinity as far as the people are concerned, but because they are buying us – and this is what makes the difference.</p>\n<p>And I think that the role of India will always be a powerful role and therefore, I do not see how any country – especially when we are talking of China – how they will have the same influence.</p>\n<p><strong>If I may give an example in your neighbourhood. India has had a very close relationship with Maldives, with a big aid budget and inter-connected economic linkages. However, the Chinese have made definite inroads into Maldives, with big infrastructure projects. India may have historical links with all the countries in Indian Ocean region, but that cannot be taken for granted.</strong></p>\n<p>No, no…nothing can be taken for granted. But, at the same time, given that there is a basis for this relationship among the countries in the Indian Ocean – I think this basis gives it added strength.</p>\n<p>India doesn’t have to buy its way through. When you buy your way through, you are not sure whether it’s real or not.</p>\n<p>You can compare it to the role of Taiwan. Taiwan assisted the ANC (African National Congress) during the liberation years. But then it was based on money. It was based on who could pay more. And now of course, China is the main partner (of South Africa). But why is that so? This is because it was just a question of buying. There was nothing deep. There was no affinity. They could drop Taiwan and go for China. It is basically the same difference. Whereas, with India, there is a link.</p>\n<p><strong>True. But even then, aren’t bilateral relations between nations basically transactional at a certain level?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, there is that element. But at the same time, I also believe that there is something extra. I can take myself as an example. I mean having known that my great grandfather was an indentured labourer who came from Bihar – automatically, there is now something deeper. There is an affinity (with India). This search to go back to Bihar and hopefully meet my ancient relatives.</p>\n<p>In fact, I know myself, I may end up saying that I want to make a positive contribution towards the education of say my great-great cousin. So, the emotional attachment will have a greater significance.</p>\n<p>Whereas with China, this does not exist. And this is where I feel that the role of India will be taken more seriously.</p>\n<p>India is being proactive and we are following everything… This is what will matter. You are right that nothing can be taken for granted. India is not taking anything for granted. Just like other European countries as well vis-à-vis China in Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>The ruling party has been in power since 1977. How would you assess this one year of unique situation where the president and parliament are controlled by different political parties? Has there been a learning curve to working with each other?</strong></p>\n<p>We had a one very strong ruling party. That was the former Seychelles People’s United Party (SPUP), then it changes its name to Seychelles People’s Progressive Front and now People’s Party (<em>Parti Lepep </em>or PL). That party was so powerful that it believed it would never lose any election.</p>\n<p>In fact, when I started politics and we talked about change, their members would laugh and suggested that it may happen in 2050 or 3000.</p>\n<p>Things started to change in 2015, when for the first time we had the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-seychelles-election/seychelles-presidential-race-heads-into-second-round-idUSKBN0TP04520151206\" title=\"second round\" target=\"_blank\">second round</a> in presidential elections and they (PL) felt that things were not too good.</p>\n<p>After they lost the majority in the house at the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-seychelles-%20politics/seychelles-%20opposition-wins-%20first-vote-%20in-decades-%20idUSKCN11I12H\" title=\"national assembly elections\" target=\"_blank\">national assembly elections</a>, the president then, Mr Michel, felt that he could not work with the opposition, because he is not someone who is prepared to negotiate. That’s why he stepped down and Mr Faure, the present president came in.</p>\n<p>He (President Faure) took a different attitude. He felt from day one that his party had lost its popularity. He was more of a realist. And thus, we started to talk.</p>\n<p>And soon, as we started to talk, it was a different story. He has made the difference with his approach.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of consultation which goes on right now. I am one who had always said that I am prepared to talk, I am prepared to consult to share views because it is not about myself, it is about the country. And Mr Faure has presented himself as the person who is ready to talk.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there still some major issues that cause friction between you and the president, for example on the budget?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, there are differences in the way the parties think. But again, another element that is important for you to know (is) that having taken over as president, Mr Faure – and these were his exact words – he divorced himself from the party.</p>\n<p>He was the secretary general of the party and at the election of the party executive, everybody thought he would be the party leader. But he did not present himself as a candidate. So now, he is not a member of the party executive. In fact, the vice president is the president of the party.</p>\n<p>When he took the decision not to be involved in party politics, this was another indication that he wanted to move away and be independent.</p>\n<p>But, yes, we do disagree on certain things that he wants to put forward.</p>\n<p>When we discuss the budget, there are many things we don’t accept. This year when we look at the budget for the president’s office, we decided to freeze certain million rupees. We have said to them that we are not happy with the way things were. Please sort it out and come back to us.</p>\n<p>When we look at some of the structures of (the) state, we do not agree. But at the same time, I am the leader of opposition. I have said that I am not the executive. The people of Seychelles voted for them to be in the executive. Until the people of Seychelles decide otherwise, we also have a duty to allow the executive to function. So, this is where we give them leeway to function. Even though we are not satisfied with certain structures, we still give them the money to run that programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you put your name forward in the next presidential elections?</strong></p>\n<p>I intend to put my name forward as the presidential candidate for the party (Seychelles National Party or SNP). It would, of course, be for the party to decide. But I will definitely stand. As I said, I lost the presidential elections in 2015 by 193 votes. And in 2016, the party won the popular vote and therefore I feel that I stand a good chance of winning the election. It is not just that I have a good chance of winning the election, but it is also about working for the country. I also think that the party has a very good programme for the country.</p>\n<p><strong>You are the chair of the truth and reconciliation committee of the parliament which was created for the first time after the elections. There is not much awareness in the rest of the world about what happened in the ‘dark years’ as you had referred to it. Why it is necessary for those days to be remembered and accountability to be fixed?</strong></p>\n<p>In 1977, we had the <em>coup d’état</em>. Mr (France Albert) Rene declared Seychelles as a one-party state and shut down all other political parties. Supporters of the other parties, especially the party of Mr (James) Mancham, were persecuted. They were seen as enemies of the people. People were detained illegally. They were rounded up and placed in prisons. Some people spent over six months in prisons. Some even longer. Upon being released, they were told that they could not stay in Seychelles. That’s when lots of them left and went into exile in England, in Canada in France and in Australia. These were the four main countries, and some in South Africa. But apart from that, a number of people were killed. Bodies of some were found. Bodies were considered disappeared.</p>\n<p>Then the government brought in a law to acquire anyone’s property. There was a compulsory acquisition of property and it was mainly land belonging to opponents of the ruling party. People would lose their jobs, because they were thought to be belonging to the party of Mr Mancham. (A) number of people were arrested, tortured and then released. That was the time also when the army was formed, as we didn’t have one before.</p>\n<p>Human right abuses were rampant and people lived in a lot of fear. People were scared to talk. Thousands <a href=\"https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1979VICTOR01723_e.html\" title=\"left the country\" target=\"_blank\">left the country</a>.</p>\n<p>Even the schooling regime was changed. Upon reaching the age of 13, all students who want to continue with their education, were placed in villages called national youth service. It meant that between the age of 13-14 and 16, they were removed from their parents. It was to instil communism in them. But this failed miserably. This is part of the dark years, and we want to sort this out through this commission and hopefully move on.</p>\n<p><strong>You have said that next month the Seychelles parliament may consider a new law to set up a national commission to hear testimonies about those years of suppression. But this law will also be to provide immunity to persons of even heinous crimes, if they confess. Are you including even the two former presidents under this?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two issues here. One, the <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sc/sc001en.pdf\" title=\"constitution\" target=\"_blank\">constitution</a> prescribes that a former president can only be charged within three years of leaving office. After that, he has immunity. One thing that we in the opposition are thinking of changing is to amend this section in the constitution. We do not have two-third majority, but we want to have cooperation of the ruling party.</p>\n<p>This is also related to the fight against corruption. Evidences of corrupt practices often surface much later. That’s why we want to remove the immunity.</p>\n<p>That is the first step that we have to take. Once we take this step and remove the immunity, only then will the possibility of bringing a former president to court on evidence of witnesses under the truth commission be there. Until the first step is taken, the second step cannot happen.</p>\n<p>Mr Michel still falls within those three years, that’s true. If there is anything that is found against him, then yes, we should be able to initiate something there.</p>\n<p><strong>You are the first person from Seychelles who would be going to their ancestral village. Why has it taken so much time?</strong></p>\n<p>The more I think of it, I am starting to believe that my family were the only descendants of an indentured labourer from Bihar, who actually made it from Mauritius to Seychelles.</p>\n<p>The first piece of information that I got was the birth certificate of my grandfather from Mauritius. I knew his name from the marriage certificate. So, when I knew his name, I got his birth certificate. And on his birth certificate, which was interesting, was the immigration number of his father who was an indentured labourer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10181538/collage1.jpg?fit=750%2C400\" data-orig-size=\"750,400\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10181538/collage1.jpg?fit=300%2C160\" data-attachment-id=\"212577\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10181538/collage1.jpg?resize=750%2C400&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212476/seychelles-slow-removing-hurdles-indias-assumption-island-project-leader-opposition/collage1-27/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10181538/collage1.jpg?fit=750%2C400\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"collage1\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212577\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seychelles’ Leader of Opposition shows the copies of immigration records that trace the journey of his great-grandfather from India’s Bihar state</p></div>\n<p>So, with that number, I then, through the Mahatma Gandhi institute (in Mauritius), got all his details which include the age that he left, his height (5’6), his village (‘Pursounee’ in Chapra district).</p>\n<p>I got this (details from Mauritius) a couple of years back. But, I had received the birth certificate of my grandfather some time earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Then why did it take you so long to come to India to trace back your family’s journey?</strong></p>\n<p>I had always said that I would do it (visit the village in India).

The full text of his speech is reproduced below.</em></p>\n<p>§</p>\n<p>I am grateful to so many friends for gathering this afternoon for a conversation on a subject that should be a matter of vital concern to all of us.</p>\n<p>Rather than feeling outraged, I am inclined to be thankful to the government and its empowered instruments like the UIDAI and the police for slapping a criminal case against <em>The Tribune</em> and my colleague, Ms Rachna Khaira.</p>\n<p>I wish to reiterate – with all the seriousness and as responsibly as possible – that what Ms Khaira did was nothing more than perform her duty as a professional journalist. And we at<em> The Tribune</em> did nothing more than what any other set of editors in a newspaper would have done.</p>\n<p>And, let me confess: We at <em>The Tribune</em> do not think of ourselves as manning the barricades. We do not subscribe to permanent insurrection. We are not chasing any revolution. We believe in the Constitution and its values; we assiduously seek to provide space to the voices of dissent.</p>\n<p>And yet we are sought to be hauled up for doing a spot of honest, legitimate investigative reporting; we are sought to be intimidated for practising  a bit of old fashioned journalism. And so, if the arrogant rulers of the day can think of wanting to arrest the reporter and the <em>Tribune</em> editor, which journalist in India can feel safe and confident in pursuing an honest story?</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for suddenly making the entire media fraternity realise the need for solidarity and strength.</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for throwing the harsh provisions of the law at us because suddenly it was evident  to one and all – from the most pro-government to the most professionally detached media outlets – that the sub-inspector can come calling on anyone of us, whatever be the colour of our partisanship.</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for reminding us that each one of us has an opportunity every day to stand up to the power; to question the bureaucratic theology; to dispute the officially-mandated orthodoxy.</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for proving once again that the state does not have any monopoly over competence; that the state depends upon functionaries who are not – and cannot be – gods; that these functionaries are often inept, inadequate and ill-equipped to be the repositories of our welfare.</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for exposing themselves and their false pretences.</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for re-introducing a dash of passion and energy and anger into the heart of every single Rachna Khaira who is out there in every single newsroom.</p>\n<p>We need to be thankful to the authorities for being so clumsy, so bureaucratic and so haughty – because responsible journalism never felt as joyful as it does this afternoon.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212594/harish-khare-tribune-uidai-aadhaar-data-breach/\">‘Responsible Journalism Never Felt as Joyful’</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> At the peak of the controversy surrounding whistleblower Indian Forest Service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi exposing major corruption in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made a telephonic call to the then health minister Harsh Vardhan to discuss the issue, an RTI has revealed. The hospital administration and the Union health ministry had been pushing for Chaturvedi’s removal from the post of chief vigilance officer (CVO) at the premier medical institution at the time.</p>\n<p>But while Chaturvedi was later divested of the charges, no action was taken against those who were indicted by him in his investigation as CVO.</p>\n<p><strong>PM made call to health minister</strong></p>\n<p>Queries filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act have revealed that Prime Minister Modi made a call to Harsh Vardhan on August 23, 2014, to discuss the issue of removing Chaturvedi from the post of the CVO at AIIMS.</p>\n<p>“The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India had a telephonic discussion with the Hon’ble Union minister of health and family welfare regarding relieving the additional charge of CVO, AIIMS, New Delhi from Sh. Sanjiv Chaturvedi, DS, AIIMS, New Delhi. A detailed note in this regard is submitted for perusal of Hon’ble Prime Minister of India,” a letter sent by the then Union health secretary Lov Verma to principal secretary to the prime minister, Nripendra Mishra, revealed.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Chaturvedi had sent an exhaustive note to Modi in September 2014, disclosing details of all the cases of corruption exposed and acted upon by him in his tenure as CVO from July 2012 to August 2014. He had enclosed all the letters written by the then Rajya Sabha MP JP Nadda which demanded<span> his removal from AIIMS and a halt to all the corruption cases investigated by him.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Nadda made minister despite allegations of supporting corruption at AIIMS</strong></p>\n<p>According to the RTI replies, the prime minister’s office took note of these letters and on October 8, 2014, sought a comment from the Union health secretary on Chaturvedi’s allegations. However, despite Chaturvedi highlighting <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/3928/nadda-protecting-the-corrupt-aiims-whistleblower-tells-tribunal/\" title=\"Nadda’s stance on corruption at AIIMS\" target=\"_blank\">Nadda’s stance on corruption at AIIMS</a>, Modi made him the Union health minister in November 2014, which automatically made him the ex-officio president of AIIMS, and thus, Chaturvedi’s superior. This was unfair as in one of his prayers, Chaturvedi had also urged Modi to provide protection to him and to prevent further witch-hunting.</p>\n<p>Though it appeared that the prime minister’s office was keen on pursuing Chaturvedi’s complaint and followed its note to the health secretary with a reminder on February 10, 2015, to expedite the comments, replies to other RTI queries reveal exactly the opposite.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10170118/2015_2largeimg126_Feb_2015_085310690gallery.jpg?fit=660%2C415\" data-orig-size=\"660,415\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10170118/2015_2largeimg126_Feb_2015_085310690gallery.jpg?fit=300%2C189\" data-attachment-id=\"212562\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10170118/2015_2largeimg126_Feb_2015_085310690gallery.jpg?resize=671%2C422&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212518/rti-reveals-modi-called-health-minister-discuss-removal-aiims-whistleblower-sanjiv-chaturvedi/2015_2largeimg126_feb_2015_085310690gallery-2/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10170118/2015_2largeimg126_Feb_2015_085310690gallery.jpg?fit=660%2C415\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"2015_2largeimg126_Feb_2015_085310690gallery\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212562\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">File photo of Sanjiv Chaturvedi standing outside the All India Institue of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

A number of cases, including the case of work withdrawal, is still pending before the courts. One of the pending cases is the zero appraisal report case<strong> </strong>in which he succeeded in getting a stay order in September 2017. All this indicates that the government did not stand by him.</p>\n<p><strong>Modi made the call, but did not act</strong></p>\n<p>While it is not known what transpired in the conversation between Modi and Harsh Vardhan, the RTI replies reveal a level of inertia in governance. Ideally, Modi should have either taken an action against Chaturvedi in case his documents were false or Nadda should have been sacked in keeping with the much-proclaimed policy of zero tolerance against corruption.</p>\n<p>But neither of the two options were exercised. Nadda, in fact, was given a free hand and went on to close all the major corruption cases exposed by Chaturvedi, overruling the Central Bureau of Investigation’s recommendations for action against the accused. Even the <a href=\"http://smartinvestor.business-standard.com/pf/Pfnews-387740-Pfnewsdet-Parliamentary_Standing_Committee_report_on_corruption_in_the_hospital_has_no_foundation_AIIMS.htm\" title=\"87th report of the standing parliamentary committee\" target=\"_blank\">87th report of the standing parliamentary committee</a> tabled in August 2015 had ‘strongly deprecated’ the attitude of the health ministry in tackling corruption at AIIMS. But Modi and his office has maintained complete silence on the issue.</p>\n<p><b>An intimated bureaucracy</b></p>\n<p>The RTI replies have also revealed how the bureaucracy was intimidated by the Centre to proceed against Chaturvedi. File notings of health secretary Verma, an IAS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre, 1978 batch, have revealed that on May 23,<sup> </sup>2014, he had set aside all the objections raised by Nadda over the appointment of Chaturvedi as CVO, declared the controversy as closed, and lauded Chaturvedi for his integrity and performance. But file notings of August 13, 2014, reveal that after the Modi government came to power, Verma moved a proposal for Chaturvedi’s removal which was signed by around 20 officers of the health ministry within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212518/rti-reveals-modi-called-health-minister-discuss-removal-aiims-whistleblower-sanjiv-chaturvedi/\">RTI Reveals Modi Called Health Minister to Discuss Removal of AIIMS Whistleblower Sanjiv Chaturvedi</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters/Danish Siddiqui/Files</p></div>\n<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses global investors at the annual Davos World Economic Forum (WEF), the Indian cabinet <span data-term=\"goog_1498314598\">on Wednesday</span> further eased foreign direct investment (FDI) norms in key sectors like retail, civil aviation, construction and power exchanges.</p>\n<p>The move comes at a time when the Indian economy is going through a soft patch and the government is fiscally constrained to step up public spending to support recovery.</p>\n<p>Now foreign companies can invest upto 100% through the automatic route in their single brand retail operations in India. Until now, they were allowed to invest only upto 49% through this route. For additional investment, they were required to obtain government approval.</p>\n<p>The mandatory requirement of purchasing 30% goods locally, a major put-off for foreign retailers, too has been diluted. Now the government has decided “to permit single brand retail trading entity to set off its incremental sourcing of goods from India for global operations during initial 5 years, beginning <span data-term=\"goog_1498314599\">April 1</span> of the year of the opening of first store against the mandatory sourcing requirement of 30% of purchases,” said an official release.</p>\n<p>“For this purpose, incremental sourcing will mean the increase in terms of value of such global sourcing from India for that single brand in rupee terms in a particular financial year over the preceding financial year, by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading entity, either directly or through their group companies. After completion of this 5 year period, the single bran retailer will be required to meet the 30% sourcing norms directly towards its India’s operation, on an annual basis,” the release further stated.</p>\n<p>The decision will benefit world’s leading smartphone maker Apple and Swedish home furnishing major IKEA, which have set up shop here.</p>\n<p>Industry experts welcomed the move. “For foreign retailers, coming to India and then waiting for government approval was not a good thing,” Anil Talreja , partner, Deloitte India, told <em>The Wire</em>.</p>\n<p>As many as 50 retailers have been keen to enter the Indian market. But because of  the complicated approval route for investment proposals, they have been hesitant.</p>\n<p>Today’s cabinet decision will force these players to rethink, said Talreja.</p>\n<p>To widen competition for the purchase of Air India, which is to be put on the block soon as part of the disinvestment plan, the government has also lifted the restriction barring foreign airlines from picking up stakes in the national carrier. Now overseas players can take upto 49% stakes in Air India subject to government approval.</p>\n<p>This is a major climb-down by the Narendra Modi government, which had earlier disfavoured purchase of Air India assets by foreign players. It seems that domestic private operators’ low interest in the national carrier has forced the government to change its mind.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10183303/2018-01-10T103340Z_1_LYNXMPEE090J8_RTROPTP_4_AIR-INDIA-FRANCE1.jpg?fit=4108%2C2632\" data-orig-size=\"4108,2632\" data-image-title=\"An Air India Airbus A320neo plane takes off in Colomiers near Toulouse\" class=\"wp-image-212588\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10183303/2018-01-10T103340Z_1_LYNXMPEE090J8_RTROPTP_4_AIR-INDIA-FRANCE1.jpg?fit=300%2C192\" data-attachment-id=\"212588\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;An Air India Airbus A320neo plane takes off in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, December 13, 2017.

Until now, foreign investors were supposed to invest in power exchanges through the secondary market only. Now the restriction has been lifted and foreign players can invest upto 49% via the primary market as well.</p>\n<p>As of now, India has just operational power exchanges – Indian Energy Exchange and Power Exchange of India. But the cabinet decision might open the door for setting up of a third power exchange in the country. The government is considering raising the ceiling for single-player foreign investment from 5% to 15%, industry sources said.</p>\n<p>The cabinet has also allowed 100% FDI in real estate broking services by clarifying that it does not amount to real estate business.</p>\n<p>With domestic private players reluctant to make fresh investment, the Modi government has been wooing foreign investors with relaxed FDI norms. It has recently abolished the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, the screening committee which was an anathema to foreign investors.</p>\n<p>In November 2015, the government liberalised FDI norms for more than 15 sectors including construction to attract investment.</p>\n<p>The annual Davos jamboree begins on <span data-term=\"goog_1498314600\">January 22</span>.

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>An RTI filed by Rahul Sehrawat, a resident of Hisar, Haryana, has shed light on how the state government spent a staggering Rs 3,79,500 to buy just 10 copies of the Bhagavad Gita during the International Gita Mahotsav in November 2017. Each copy reportedly cost the government more than Rs 37,000.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Times of India</em>, “Sources confirmed that the copies were prepared with special paper and were designed in such a manner that they looked like ancient manuscripts.”</p>\n<p>The copies were reportedly given as gifts to VVIPs attending the event. More so, the RTI reply states that the state also paid Rs 15 lakh to BJP MP and Bollywood star Hema Malini and Rs 10 lakh to Delhi BJP president and actor Manoj Tiwari for their performances at the event.</p>\n<p>But the information, provided by the Kurukshetra Development Board, does not fully delve into why a total of Rs 15 crore had been sanctioned for the event as it only explains how Rs 4.32 crore was spent. The RTI reply shows that ‘Tanvi Stationers’ was paid for the ten copies.</p>\n<p>It has been reported that the Haryana government has denied these allegations.</p>\n<p>At the time of the event, Haryana chief minister ML Khattar had said that “the money was spent on creating awareness in society and was needed in the larger interest of society”, and that the expenses had been incurred after a great deal of “deliberation”.</p>\n<p>Among the ‘VVIPs” who attended the event were Union minister Uma Bharti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and the governors of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. It was inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind.</p>\n<p>The opposition has questioned the need to spend such large sums of hard-earned taxpayer money on such frivolous gifts. Calling the government an “event management company”, Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda quipped that he hoped that the government had “not used gold in preparing the copies”.</p>\n<p>“The RTI information itself is sufficient to prove grave misuse of public money,” Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader and Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala was reported as saying by <em>Scroll</em>. “I hope the chief minister [Manohar Lal Khattar] would conduct a fair inquiry into such misappropriation of public money.”</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdchautala%2Fphotos%2Fa.692963067389108.1073741827.692941134057968%2F1750092095009528%2F%3Ftype%3D3&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"664\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212551/haryana-govts-flagrant-waste-taxpayer-money-10-copies-bhagvad-gita-bought-rs-3-8-lakh/\">Haryana Govt’s Flagrant Waste of Taxpayer Money: 10 Copies of Bhagvad Gita Bought for Rs 3.8 Lakh</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

That was when Kashmir was gradually emerging from a months-long uprising, during which close to 100 civilians were killed and several hundred others lost partial or complete eyesight.</p>\n<p>The People’s Democratic Party (PDP)-Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) alliance has now announced <em>panchayat</em> elections in the state from February 15 onwards – the first major activity on the part of the government in Kashmir after more than a year. It comes at a time when mainstream politics, which was marginalised after the six-month-long street protests in 2016 triggered by the killing of rebel militant commander Burhan Wani, is trying to make a comeback.</p>\n<p>“Violence is not a solution to any issue. Besides, these (panchayat) polls are a means to empower people at the grassroots levels and ensure redress to their day-to-day problems through active participation in the government,” a senior PDP minister told <em>The Wire</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Overdue election and  BJP’s ‘push’</strong></p>\n<p>While the government has been repeatedly saying that panchayat institutions are a means to decentralise power and decision-making, the elections to it have never been a regular feature in J&amp;K. In 1978, <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/after-32-years-jk-panchayat-members-set-to-get-their-due/article4157166.ece\" title=\"rural body elections were held in the state\" target=\"_blank\">rural body elections were held in the state</a> when Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah was the chief minister. The next such exercise was conducted after 23 years, in 2001, and the last panchayat election was held a decade after that in 2011. The polls have now been pending for the past one-and-a-half years, since the previous panchayats completed their term in July 2016.</p>\n<p>While the government has on occasion tried to hold polls, in September 2017, Union home minister Rajnath Singh while on a three-day visit to the state asked the government to begin preparations for the reconstitution of panchayat institutions. Soon after that, <a href=\"http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/governor-vohra-promulgates-the-jammu-and-kashmir-panchayati-raj-amendment-ordinance-2017/\" title=\"governor N.N. Vohra promulgated an ordinance\" target=\"_blank\">governor N.N. Vohra promulgated an ordinance</a> setting the ball rolling for the same.</p>\n<p>According to a senior official, there has been a “constant push” from the BJP for conducting polls. In one of its meetings in Jammu on December 22, the RSS-BJP coordination committee had instructed ministers of the right-wing party to mount pressure on the PDP for holding panchayat elections.</p>\n<p><strong>A ‘tricky’ decision</strong></p>\n<p>The April 2011 panchayat elections <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panchayat-polls-in-jammu-ladakh-and-north-kashmir-can-be-held-from-may-15-ceo/story-aOgkaU3S0j2lBlcLIeKDZO.html\" title=\"witnessed a record 80% turnout\" target=\"_blank\">witnessed a record 80% turnout</a>. The electoral exercise was conducted barley a few months after the summer uprising of 2010 in which over 120 civilians were killed. The announcement of polls had surprised many since at the time anger was running deep. But on D-day, long queues outside polling booths dealt a setback to separatists who had called for a complete boycott.</p>\n<p>While the government is hoping for a repeat of 2011 as it prepares for fresh elections, many remain wary. “With the kind of situation we are passing through, it (the announcement of elections) was unexpected and many people will not appreciate it. I don’t think time the is conducive,” said political analyst Noor M. Baba.</p>\n<p>According to him, the decision is fraught with danger and could lead to “further deterioration in situation if things go wrong”. “If the exercise goes smoothly, it will be a win-win situation for the government, and more importantly it will push mainstream political discourse to the front. But god forbid if there is a backlash, the situation could turn ugly and then the responsibility with lie with the government,” Baba told <em>The Wire</em>, though he insisted that decentralisation of power through panchayat polls should always be welcomed and that the institutions should be left alone.</p>\n<p>While the government is banking on protest and stone-pelting incidents in the Valley petering out, there is still anger on the ground, particularly in south Kashmir – which is spread over four districts and was the epicentre of the 2016 uprising. Till the first half of last year, south Kashmir was a no-go area for mainstream politicians.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10150329/mehbooba-mufti-1506424490.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10150329/mehbooba-mufti-1506424490.jpg?fit=715%2C431\" data-orig-size=\"715,431\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10150329/mehbooba-mufti-1506424490.jpg?fit=300%2C181\" data-attachment-id=\"212508\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10150329/mehbooba-mufti-1506424490.jpg?resize=715%2C431&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212467/separatists-call-boycott-threats-militants-cast-shadow-upcoming-jk-panchayat-polls/mehbooba-mufti-1506424490/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10150329/mehbooba-mufti-1506424490.jpg?fit=715%2C431\" alt=\"Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti.

Similarly, mainstream politicians – from both ruling and opposition parties – haven’t been able to hold party functions without security. While the situation is similar in north Kashmir, the opposition National Conference held a couple of party functions there following the announcement of elections.</p>\n<p>The chief minister <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/politics/mehbooba-mufti-hopeful-of-jammu-and-kashmir-choosing-ballots-over-bullets-in-2018-panchayat-polls-4275767.html\" title=\"has expressed optimism\" target=\"_blank\">has expressed optimism</a> that the polls will be smooth. “I hope people will choose ballots over bullets,” she tweeted.</p>\n<p><strong>The challenges</strong></p>\n<p>However, barely two days after the government announced the poll dates, the “joint resistance leadership” comprising Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik <a href=\"https://kashmirobserver.net/2017/local-news/resistance-camp-calls-panchayat-poll-boycott-27174\" title=\"called for its complete boycott\" target=\"_blank\">called for its complete boycott</a> saying “such an exercise is only meant to harm national interests of Kashmir”.</p>\n<p>“We cannot vote to strengthen hands of tyrants …elections and institutions formed by these elections are detrimental to interests of Kashmiris and as a living nation we all should keep away from this farce exercise and boycott these elections in totality,” a statement issued by the trio said.</p>\n<p>The boycott call by separatists isn’t the only challenge the government faces. The militant organisation Hizbul Mujahideen has <a href=\"http://www.news18.com/news/india/hizbul-mujahideen-threatens-to-pour-acid-into-eyes-of-panchayat-poll-candidates-1626377.html\" title=\"purportedly threatened\" target=\"_blank\">purportedly threatened</a> to “pour acid” into the eyes of those who participate in the elections.</p>\n<p>“In 2016 you saw that how many youth lost their eye sights (to pellets). We have planned whosoever fights elections, he will be dragged out of his home and concentrated acid will be poured into his eyes so that he loses his eyesight,” Hizb’s operational commander Riyaz Naikoo is heard telling another militant during a conversation, a clip of which has been circulated on social media.</p>\n<p>While J&amp;K police has said it is verifying the authenticity of the audio clip, in the past similar audios and videos have surfaced on social media wherein militant groups have confirmed their stand on different issues.</p>\n<p>The open threat by the militant outfit has sent both security agencies and the government into a tizzy. “We shouldn’t approve of violence in any form…but one thing is clear that the outcome of the election will decide how coming months will shape up in Kashmir.

This deliberately provocative piece asks what these convictions signal – whether lower-caste politicians are more likely to be corrupt, or more likely to be caught, compared to upper-caste politicians whose social position allows them to go scot-free with impunity for equal or more serious crimes. Ashis Nandy, the well-known political psychologist, unleashed a virtual tornado a few years back by <a href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/most-of-the-corrupt-from-scsts-obcs-ashis-nandy/788010\" title=\"claiming\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> that it is the former – that SC-ST politicians are more likely to be corrupt – and suggested that this fact makes the polity more democratic.</p>\n<p>Both these opinions are based on casual empiricism on the part of their authors. Given that the only instances of publicly-known corruption of politicians would be those that result in convictions, the question of whether lower caste politicians are more corrupt, or get convicted more often, will remain up in the air. The widespread mainstream imagination will most likely confirm its prior belief that they <em>are</em> more corrupt and bemoan another instance of the worsening of public culture due to the rise of lower castes in politics.</p>\n<p>This is a good time to pause and see if there is any systematic evidence that allows us to assess the performance of politicians, both inside and outside houses to which they are elected. Have there been serious academic studies that compare SC politicians with upper caste politicians? Marc Galanter, assessing the changing perceptions about the performance of SC politicians over the 1960s and ‘70s, <a href=\"http://www.epw.in/journal/1979/7-8/annual-number-specials/perspectives.html-18\" title=\"found\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that perceptions had become more favourable over the two decades, in that SC MLAs were increasingly viewed as ‘effective’ and ‘articulate’ inside assemblies.</p>\n<p>This is not just a matter of perception. If SC MLAs are systematically ineffective (or less effective than their upper caste counterparts) either inside assemblies or outside, it will show up in an objective assessment. However, this appraisal would need to be rigorous and not based on casual empiricism or anecdotal evidence. A <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/social-justice-through-inclusion-9780190646615?cc=us&lang=en&\" title=\"recent book\" target=\"_blank\">recent book</a> by Francesca R. Jensenius does precisely that. The author uses publicly-available data (combining detailed data from the 1971-2001 censuses of India on both reserved and non-reserved constituencies), and a clever empirical strategy to produce a nuanced, in-depth and solid treatise on the effect of electoral quotas at the <em>constituency level</em> over three decades. What adds value to her work is the fact that she supplements her study with more than 100 in-depth interviews with Indian politicians, civil servants, activists and voters from four Indian states (Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka) as a part of her qualitative fieldwork in order to understand the mechanisms that produce the results that her data reveal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/203734/ugly-reality-caste-violence-discrimination-urban-india/\" title=\"The Ugly Reality of Caste Violence and Discrimination in Urban India\" target=\"_blank\">The Ugly Reality of Caste Violence and Discrimination in Urban India</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>As she shows, politicians in India spend most of their time in their constituencies, with a very small amount of their time taken up by assembly meetings. If SC politicians are “weak” or “inefficient”, we should expect to see less overall development in constituencies reserved for SCs. Also, if SC politicians systematically try to benefit the SC community within their constituencies, we should expect to see more redistribution to SCs in reserved constituencies than in comparable general (non-reserved) constituencies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10120601/download2.jpeg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10120601/download2.jpeg?fit=806%2C545\" data-orig-size=\"806,545\" data-image-title=\"A supporter of BSP waves a flag featuring the party’s chief Mayawati during an election campaign rally in Lucknow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212322/how-connecting-caste-and-political-corruption-presents-an-incomplete-picture/a-supporter-of-bsp-waves-a-flag-featuring-the-partys-chief-mayawati-during-an-election-campaign-rally-in-lucknow/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10120601/download2.jpeg?fit=806%2C545\" alt=\"\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212409\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10120601/download2.jpeg?fit=300%2C203\" data-attachment-id=\"212409\" data-image-meta=\"{\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10120601/download2.jpeg?resize=967%2C654&ssl=1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Bahujan Samaj Party supporter waves a flag featuring the party’s chief Mayawati during an election campaign rally in Lucknow. Credit: Reuters/Pawan Kumar</p></div>\n<p>She examines both – changes in the overall level of development, as well as the distribution of resources between SCs and others – in each constituency. Her dataset includes estimates of development indicators for more than 3,100 state assembly constituencies from the 15 largest Indian states between 1971 and 2001, making it possible to examine development patterns in reserved and general constituencies over a 30-year period.</p>\n<p>She finds no negative developmental effects of electoral quotas, i.e. development indicators are no worse in reserved constituencies, compared to non-reserved constituencies, controlling for other factors. Additionally, there have been several positive outcomes as a result of quotas, going beyond standard development indicators. She finds that quotas <em>have </em>contributed to breaking social boundaries by bringing a marginalised and stigmatised community into positions of power – a group that most likely would have been elected in smaller numbers had it not been for these quotas. This has also contributed to a reduction in caste-based discrimination in reserved constituencies.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/199881/story-india-story-caste/\" title=\"‘Story of India Is the Story of Caste’\" target=\"_blank\">‘Story of India Is the Story of Caste’</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Where is corruption in this picture? We don’t know and, most likely, will never know. Given that corruption, both petty and big-ticket, is <a href=\"http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/india-is-most-corrupt-in-asia-pacific-69-paid-bribes-for-govt-services-report-2459823.html\" title=\"all-pervasive\" target=\"_blank\">all-pervasive</a> in the entire country, it would be difficult to empirically sustain the case that it is predominantly due to lower castes. Also, what is missing in the popular discussion on corruption is the other side of the picture. If politicians are caught with ‘assets disproportionate to their known sources of income’, it is because some deep pockets finance them in return for all kinds of favours. Just as bribe-takers are corrupt, bribe-givers are corrupt too. And, we know for a fact, that SCs are seriously under-represented among the deep pockets, the rich and the elite.</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that mainstream opinion will wake up one day and realise that its preconceptions about SC politicians being more corrupt lack empirical validity and offer <em>mea culpa</em>. The point simply is that the belief about greater lower caste culpability in acquiring disproportionate assets is more likely a myth than a reality. This is analogous to the myth about the decline in “merit” or “efficiency” as a result of affirmative action, which persists despite lack of empirical evidence, because it feeds neatly into the public antipathy towards any policy of compensatory discrimination.</p>\n<p>To the extent corruption lowers the quality of development, if SC politicians were indeed more corrupt, we should have seen some manifestation in development indicators in their constituencies. But factors affecting development are unrelated to whether the elected representatives are SC or upper caste. While the development indicators in reserved constituencies have been no worse, reservations, which have resulted in a substantial group of elected politicians from the so-called lower castes, have produced a range of other positive benefits outside the narrow prism of development. This can lead to one of two conclusions: either that far from lowering the quality of public culture, the presence of lower caste politicians has actually infused it with critical missing elements, vital to the strengthening of democracy. Or, if we do find a worsening, the caste of elected representatives has nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/ashwini-deshpande/\" title=\"Ashwini Deshpande\" target=\"_blank\">Ashwini Deshpande</a> is a professor of economics at the University of Delhi.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212322/how-connecting-caste-and-political-corruption-presents-an-incomplete-picture/\">Links Between Caste and Political Corruption Aren’t Based on Concrete Evidence</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

I managed to escape. Safe and with police now,” Siddiqui tweeted from a friend’s Twitter account early in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Looking for support in any way possible #StopEnforcedDisappearances,” he added in the same tweet.</p>\n<p>Rights groups have denounced the<span> kidnap</span>pings of several social media activists over the past year as<span> attempt</span>s to intimidate and silence critics of the Pakistan’s security establishment.</p>\n<p>Last year, five<span> Pakistani </span>bloggers went missing for several weeks before four of them were released.

Limited KYC will allow agencies to do their own paperless KYC process without access to the Aadhaar number,” the notification states.</span></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10164126/Screen-Shot-2018-01-10-at-4.40.15-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10164126/Screen-Shot-2018-01-10-at-4.40.15-PM.png?fit=794%2C522\" data-orig-size=\"794,522\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10164126/Screen-Shot-2018-01-10-at-4.40.15-PM.png?fit=300%2C197\" data-attachment-id=\"212552\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10164126/Screen-Shot-2018-01-10-at-4.40.15-PM.png?resize=794%2C522&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212523/data-breaches-leaks-uidai-rolls-new-security-measures/screen-shot-2018-01-10-at-4-40-15-pm/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10164126/Screen-Shot-2018-01-10-at-4.40.15-PM.png?fit=794%2C522\" alt=\"A screenshot of the UIDAI notification.

The latter will only be allowed to initiate limited KYC processes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Essentially, local AUAs will carry out the same KYC process but do it with an “unique UID token” instead of an Aadhaar number. </span></p>\n<p><span>“UID token allows an agency to ensure uniqueness of its beneficiaries, customers etc without having to store Aadhaar number in their databases while not being able to merge databases across agencies thus enhancing privacy. All agencies should use UID tokens within their system” the notification states.</span></p>\n<p><span>When a local AUA pings UIDAI for an authentication request, UIDAI (in response to the limited KYC request) will return a unique UID token. This token will remain unique for an Aadhaar number for all authentication requests by that particular entity – however for a particular Aadhaar number, there will be different tokens when it comes to different AUAs and sub AUAs.</span></p>\n<p><span>Crucially, however, global AUAs will not need to adhere to the token system. When they perform authentication requests will be given the Aadhaar number and a token.</span></p>\n<p><b>System rollout date?</b></p>\n<p><span>In order for these two new security measures to work, all AUAs will need to rejig their systems, to make sure they can accept a VID instead of an Aadhaar number and use a UID token within their database instead of an Aadhaar number.</span></p>\n<p><span>The UIDAI plans on rolling out “necessary APIs with implementation” by March 1, 2018 and all agencies will have to migrate to the new system by June 1, 2018 failing which their authentication services will be discontinued.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212523/data-breaches-leaks-uidai-rolls-new-security-measures/\">After Data Breaches and Leaks, UIDAI Rolls Out New Security Measures</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Ruth Mace</p></div>\n<p>From medieval witch hunts in Europe to contemporary “witch doctors” in Tanzania, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-last-witch-hunter-why-modern-visions-of-witches-dont-conjure-up-reality-49862\" title=\"belief in witchcraft\" target=\"_blank\">belief in witchcraft</a> has existed across human societies throughout history. Anthropologists have long been fascinated by the phenomenon, but have struggled to study it with quantitative methods – our understanding of how and why it arises is therefore poor.</p>\n<p>But a study we conducted of one Chinese region provided an opportunity to test the most common hypothesis – that witchcraft accusations act as punishment for those who do not cooperate with local norms. According to this theory, witch tags mark supposedly untrustworthy individuals and encourage others to conform out of fear of being labelled. However, some empirical studies have shown that witch labelling instead <a href=\"http://ir-library.ku.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/123456789/13223/The%20Impact%20of%20Magic%20and%20Witchcraft....pdf;sequence=1\" title=\"undermines trust\" target=\"_blank\">undermines trust</a> and social cohesion in a society.</p>\n<p>Our study is based on 800 households in five villages in south-western China. We examined the social behaviour of those who were labelled with a “witch” tag, and compared it with those who were not. The work, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038_s41562-017-0271-6\" title=\"published in Nature Human Behaviour\" target=\"_blank\">published in Nature Human Behaviour</a>, was the basis of a long-term collaboration between scientists from University College London, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and Lanzhou University.</p>\n<p>To determine the social networks and cooperation between households, we conducted house-to-house surveys, asking who had children, marriages and partnerships with whom. We also collected data on gift-giving, and on working groups on farms during harvest and planting seasons to see who was helping other households with their farming. All these measures gave rise to four social networks between households based on kinship, reproductive partners, gifts exchanged or farm work.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic poison</strong></p>\n<p>While in the area, we were occasionally warned not to eat in certain households, as women there were believed to be supernatural “poison givers”. The label they used – “<em>zhu</em>” or “<em>zhubo</em>” – is sometimes also translated as “witch”. It was common knowledge which homes were so labelled and we were surprised to find it accounted for 13% of the households.</p>\n<p>The tag was one of the strongest predictors of assortment on social networks. Those from tagged households rarely had children or partnerships with those from untagged households, nor did they exchange gifts or work on each others’ farms very often. However, tagged households were helping each other and reproducing with each other, which mitigated the costs of exclusion from mainstream social networks.</p>\n<p>We also played an “economic game” in the villages, where each person was given a small sum of money and asked to donate any proportion of it they wished to the village (to be divided among all the players). We found no evidence that those tagged as “witches” were any less cooperative in this game than any others.</p>\n<p>In fact, we found that labelled households were very similar to other households, except the tagged households were more likely to be headed by women and were actually slightly wealthier than average.</p>\n<p>We also discovered that the process of acquiring the label was opaque. Even victims often did not know who had started a rumour about them, they may just begin to notice others avoiding them. Some sources report such tags running in the family, with daughters inheriting the status from their mothers. Hence the origin of the slur could have occurred long ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Interpreting the results</strong></p>\n<p>Anthropologists who believe that the fear of loss of reputation (by witch labelling or other reasons) can be a huge driver of cooperation in the wider community <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16981?WT.feed_name=subjects_social-evolution\" title=\"often back their arguments\" target=\"_blank\">often back their arguments</a> with laboratory experiments using economic games. Such experiments also show that those who punish transgressors can gain reputational benefits themselves.</p>\n<p>However real world examples of this are hard to come by. Most studies of witchcraft are not quantitative and do not examine social networks as we have done. While this study suggests there is no evidence that those labelled with this harmful tag were uncooperative, it does not fully explain why such accusations stick in some cases and not in others.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is that witch accusation has evolved from competition between households. Labelling may have become a way for people to get ahead of their rivals and gain a competitive advantage in reproduction or resources. However, the sources of competition may be different in different cases.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09120549/file-20180108-83585-z24puf.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09120549/file-20180108-83585-z24puf.jpeg?fit=754%2C566\" data-orig-size=\"754,566\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09120549/file-20180108-83585-z24puf.jpeg?fit=300%2C225\" data-attachment-id=\"211999\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09120549/file-20180108-83585-z24puf.jpeg?resize=754%2C566&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211991/women-accused-witchcraft-study-rural-china-gives-clue/file-20180108-83585-z24puf/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09120549/file-20180108-83585-z24puf.jpeg?fit=754%2C566\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"file-20180108-83585-z24puf\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211999\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Giant Buddha Statue of Leshan, Sichuan, China.

For example, middle aged women are the most common victims, and accusations of poisoning are frequently involved. But there are also many differences. Another idea for the origins of witchcraft denunciations is that they are common when patriarchal institutions <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4407326\" title=\"are trying to establish dominance\" target=\"_blank\">are trying to establish dominance</a> over matriarchal ones. This could possibly also apply in this case as Buddhism, the most common religion in the area, is more male-dominated whereas the traditional social structure in the region is “matrilineal”, where descent is usually traced through the female line.</p>\n<p>A patriarchal dimension to witchcraft accusations could also explain the prevalence of women as victims both in traditional societies, and even in modern contexts that can resemble “witch hunts”, such as online bullying specifically targeting women.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/counter.theconversation.com/content/89730/count.gif?resize=1%2C1&ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The more research we do, the closer we can get to understanding and tackling the mechanisms behind these practices that can be devastating for women across the world.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://theconversation.com\" title=\"The Conversation\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a>.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>At midnight on December 20, 2017, I reached Trichy Airport from Bangkok by Air Asia Flight FD-110. I was on a holiday to Madurai (Tamil Nadu) and Adoor (Kerala) to participate in a few family get-togethers and celebrate Christmas with friends and colleagues.</p>\n<p>At around 0040, I reached the immigration desk. The lady officer on duty signalled that there was something wrong as soon as she keyed in my passport number. She had a surprised look and asked me to spell my name. I did so like an obedient child. She keyed in something again and with the same look, left the counter. Within five minutes, she returned with a male officer, probably the in-charge, and showed him what was on the computer. He read it, tried to key in my details again. He then looked at me grudgingly and instructed the lady to tell me to wait. Twenty minutes later, I went to the lady officer to enquire if there was a problem. Without a word, she signalled to the male officer asking him to come to the counter. He tried to key in my details once again, after which he firmly instructed the lady to “tell the airlines people to take their guest” and went back to his counter. I tried to talk to him, but he avoided me. I then asked the lady officer for an explanation. “You cannot go out”, she said and left the counter. I tried to talk to others but in vain.</p>\n<p>The Air Asia ground staff, who were a witness to all this, called their senior officer who informed me that I would have to wait at the airport until a return flight was available. “We are sorry sir, we can do nothing about immigration.” I was then escorted to a room labelled “entry denied,” where I stayed for another 20 hours, protected by extremely caring armed personnel and completely cut off from friends, families and the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>I didn’t have an Indian SIM and the airport didn’t have free Wi-Fi, so I could neither inform my friend waiting outside the airport nor my host in Madurai,  Henri Thipagne, a senior lawyer and executive director of Madurai-based People’s Watch. Both of them didn’t know why my entry into India was rejected. Worried and confused, they moved the court with a habeas corpus writ as soon as the courts began business on December 20, 2017. The court didn’t issue an interim order as asked for, but asked the immigration authorities to answer why my entry was denied.</p>\n<p>On January 1, 2018, the chief immigration officer thus replied: “The habeas corpus petition is misconceived since the alleged detainee is not in illegal custody… The Nepali national was not allowed entry into India as he was blacklisted and is a subject of “ban entry” Look Out Circular for indulgence in NGO activities.” He denied the petitioner’s claim that my human rights were violated and “prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to dismiss HCP (MD) No. 1842 of 2017 (the case number) as devoid of merits and thus render justice.” Alas, the officer has become a victim because of me. I feel sorry for him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/368817109/Immigration-Response#from_embed\" title=\"Immigration Response\" target=\"_blank\">Immigration Response</a> by <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/user/286754081/The-Wire#from_embed\" title=\"The Wire\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a> on Scribd</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/368817109/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-RAks7ZyZSPTJ3Tmqdk1m&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" width=\"100%\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" title=\"Immigration Response\" height=\"600\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Origin of the blacklist </strong></p>\n<p>In February 2016, I had travelled to Madurai via Chennai to participate in a workshop that aimed to explore ways to work closely with state and national human rights institutions in India. An immigration officer in Chennai wanted to know the reason for my travel. I frankly told him why I was travelling to Madurai. He  jotted down all that I said in great detail. On my return, I was asked to explain in detail what I did during my stay in Madurai, where I went and whom I met. This was quite abnormal. Smelling a rat, I informed my colleagues in Madurai about what had happened. They said: “Oh, you must have said something that you were not supposed to. It was a mistake to identify yourself as a human rights professional.” I failed to understand why my professional identity should be a problem in a democratic country founded by Gandhi.</p>\n<p>Two months later, I visited Delhi to see a doctor at AIIMS in relation to my intestinal complaint. It is then that I understood the meaning of what my friends had tried to convey to me earlier. At the Delhi immigration, after reading my profile that I am sure was created at the Chennai immigration, the officer on duty quizzed me on the reason for my visit to India. I told him that I was going to AIIMS to consult a doctor. He then asked me to produce proof that I was in Delhi for medical treatment. I presented a copy of my e-mail communication with the doctor. It took some 20 minutes for me to get the clearance.</p>\n<p>Since then, I have entered India via Delhi at least thrice for ‘medical reasons’.</p>\n<p>So, this time, too, I was aware of the probability of being quizzed and was prepared for it. But I had never imagined that the matter would go this far.</p>\n<p>Personally, the 20 hours that I spent at Trichy Airport did not deject me. I had time to finish reading Carol Dweck’s <em>Mindset</em>. The book gave me some fuel to understand the mindset “that allows people to thrive during some of the challenging times in their lives.”</p>\n<p>During my detention, I was treated extremely well. Air Asia provided water and food and the security personnel allowed me to walk freely around the lounge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alarm bells</strong></p>\n<p>It is no big deal for a mighty country like India to blacklist, detain and deport me. My deportation, which is a breach of the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship that enables citizens of Nepal and India to move freely across the border without passport or visa, does not make any news that could morally shame India. Nor does it affect India’s bilateral relations with my country, Nepal. My government will not even dare to ask India for the reason of my deportation.</p>\n<p>What is alarming, however, is not my deportation but the reason given for it. Dissecting the central argument of the immigration officer – that I was not allowed entry into India as I was blacklisted for indulgence in NGO activities – does not auger well for the future of democracy in India.</p>\n<p>In his heart of hearts, the immigration officer seemed to believe that NGO activities are criminal. Connecting the dots from Chennai, Delhi and Trichy suggests the entire immigration corps is trained along these lines. Maybe this is the line of reasoning of the Indian bureaucracy as a whole.</p>\n<p>NGOs are central constituents of a functional democracy. They play a key role in empowering the marginalised communities, who would otherwise go unaided because of their marginal status in society. I think such a democracy was what Gandhi had envisioned and Ambedkar had worked towards.</p>\n<p>I am a human rights activist contributing in a small way towards building a society in which everyone is equal and lives with dignity. I will keep pursuing this personal motto. Obstacles like the Trichy experience will only embolden my resolve.</p>\n<p><em>The next hearing in the case is on January 18.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mukunda Raj Kattel is Director of Bangkok-based Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA).

The violence that takes place in cities goes beyond robbery and assault, the gang that controls the corner, the abuses, the drug ring that terrorises the neighbourhood or the illegitimate use of force by diverse actors.</p>\n<p>Violence is also hunger, a lack of basic services, and an unjust legal system. And it is discrimination based on ethnicity, birthplace, sexual orientation and age.</p>\n<p><strong>Urban design is for white young productive men</strong></p>\n<p>Women are the omitted subjects in much urban design and planning. As Saskia Sassen <a href=\"http://www.harvarddesignmagazine.org/issues/41/built-gendering\" title=\"expressed in a 2016 article\" target=\"_blank\">expressed in a 2016 article</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Urban planning is not gender neutral. While there has long been research on how urban systems fail to respond to women’s needs, it was only a decade ago that the subject surged. Since then, countless cities have been host to initiatives addressing a version of the ‘urban-planning gender gap’.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Much research and theory is now focusing on gender and cities, bringing light to these omissions and to the subordinate situations of women in cities.</p>\n<p>Gender is here used as an <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7EDRBR2/jscott.pdf\" title=\"analytical category\" target=\"_blank\">analytical category</a> useful for highlighting the asymmetries between men and women. Society is not binary therefore it is equally concerns LGTBI population, youth, ethnicities, others.</p>\n<p>Even as change is happening, many women experience the city differently than men. Women combine productive work with family duties, fragmenting the use of time and space. During daylight hours, public spaces are more likely to be used by women, spending time in nearby parks, with children, disabled and/or senior citizens. And yet, those spaces are mainly designed for men’s needs. Urban design and planning, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/design/2012/11/evolution-urban-planning-10-diagrams/3851/\" title=\"particularly since Modernism\" target=\"_blank\">particularly since Modernism</a>, has answered to a universal citizen: white young productive men.</p>\n<p>Millions of women and girls experience violence as a kind of pandemic, natural, invisible and justified. Only recently has it been seen as resulting from patriarchal conditions where ideology and culture hide symbolic dominance and economic exploitation.</p>\n<figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>A simple street light can reduce violence</strong></p>\n<p>This recognition has produced diverse initiatives. For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/publications/whose-city-evaluation-urban-safety-women-10-countries\" title=\"Safe Cities for Women Campaign\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Cities for Women Campaign</a> developed in Brazil by Action Aid for the municipality of Garanhuns, located in the state of Pernambuco, launched a plan of public policies for women’s safety.</p>\n<p>It includes strengthening the focus on women in special courts of justice, police stations, police training, improvement in public transport, investment in street lights, training on gender and violence against women in schools, and more. Renata, a transsexual woman, political leader in Garanhuns and an active member of the Women’s Forum of Pernambuco, <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/whose_city_web.pdf\" title=\"reports on the positive actions\" target=\"_blank\">reports on the positive actions</a> taken by the city, including how a simple investment in street lighting is reducing violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Denying women’s work</strong></p>\n<p>If our understanding of cities and potential policy reforms are to enhance social progress, we must revisit urban planning from a gender-based perspective. The use of time and space should be central to gendered planning.</p>\n<p>Mothers use time in fragments – domestic tasks, school and health care each gets its own slice of time.</p>\n<p>Women’s responsibilities as family careers are not recognized at the workplace and thereby their economic contribution to both reproductive and productive work is rendered invisible.

For instance, in the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-U7rN3LOCWkJ:https://www.imf.org/%7E/media/Files/Publications/WP/wp1734.ashx\" target=\"_blank\">Latin<br>\nAmerica and the Caribbean region</a>, female participation in the work force increased by 21% between 2002 and 2012, totalling over 100 million women.</p>\n<p>In this period, the region registered significant economic growth and a decrease in poverty, but not among women. In 2002, there were 109 poor women for every 100 poor men; in 2012 the ratio rose to 118.</p>\n<p>These trends point to a disjuncture between <a href=\"http://www.edcities.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/ana-falu-EN.pdf\" title=\"economic growth and overall social progress\" target=\"_blank\">economic growth and overall social progress</a>, a pattern not unique to this region. Women constitute the <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_457317.pdf\" title=\"majority\" target=\"_blank\">majority</a> of the low-paid service sector.</p>\n<figure>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/198517/original/file-20171211-10977-a75koq.jpg?resize=754%2C503&ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Haitian domestic worker, 2012.

Further, poor women have high fertility rates, having twice as many children than rich women. Accessing sexual, health and reproductive rights is severely limited due to low social and economic status.</p>\n<p>The patterns in Latin America are evident throughout the world. Data on the informal sector in India shows that home-based workers, numbering 23.5 million, are mostly women. In the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265561368_Making_Home-based_Work_Visible_A_Review_of_Evidence_from_South_Asia\" title=\"South Asian context\" target=\"_blank\">South Asian context</a>, women’s work place is often determined by social and cultural constraints on mobility. As a result, <a href=\"https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjlabec/v_3a20_3ay_3a2002_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a170-169.htm\" title=\"home-based work\" target=\"_blank\">home-based work</a> is the one or only possible option for women to secure an income. As in Latin America, this pattern is unlikely to change even in times of robust development, such as India saw over the past two decades.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking risks to build citizenship</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to space and income considerations for social progress, it is central to consider the intangible dimension of violence suffered by women in private and public spaces, just because they are women. The persistence of male violence on the bodies of women to discipline them, is one of the most universal human-rights violations in the world.</p>\n<p>Diverse instruments have been adopted across the world: laws, protocols, participatory planning and gender budgeting. But progress is slow, as with all policy, political will and adequate resourcing are key to achieve impact.</p>\n<p>Reports on violence in cities find reports that 60% of women feel unsafe in urban spaces. Criminality and threats limit women´s freedom of movement. Women are poor in rights: political participation, autonomy, equal access to work, infrastructure, transportation and security all are marked by limited recognition of women’s rights.</p>\n<p>Women can become invisible subjects in a context where the city is a political territory for making citizenship. That is why women often have to build their citizenship by taking risks. While this risk-taking builds confidence in terms of advocacy, it nonetheless requires significant economic, cultural and symbolic resources.</p>\n<hr>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/201165/original/file-20180108-83585-2h9xo5.png?w=1160&ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em><img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/counter.theconversation.com/content/88279/count.gif?resize=1%2C1&ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">This post belongs to a series of contributions coming from the <a href=\"https://www.ipsp.org/\" title=\"International Panel on Social Progress\" target=\"_blank\">International Panel on Social Progress</a>, a global academic initiative of more than 300 scholars from all social sciences and the humanities who prepare a report on the perspectives for social progress in the 21st Century.

Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p>Nearly every time Section 377 comes up for discussion, particularly when a court or a group of people state it should be read down to legalise the naturalness of homosexual sex, narrow-minded hard-liners commoditise the LGBTQ community as an import from another nation, implying such behaviour was ‘smuggled’ into India.</p>\n<p>This consistent baseless contention has lost its way as the focus shifts to the Indian constitution and logic – a sort of a battle between fact and fiction.</p>\n<p>Back in August, when the Supreme Court spelt out its view on privacy, questioning the existence of Section 377 and its over-reaching interference over sexuality, and now through its latest decision to revisit the law, the focus has shifted to the constitution, to fundamental rights and the importance of ‘dignity’ and ‘privacy’.</p>\n<p>Yet, even as logic seems to slowly prevail in this long-drawn battle, it is alarming how many leaders take to television and other forums to claim that homosexuality has no place in the Indian constitution. As one such person, Pandit Ajay Gautam, told a national television channel, the constitution does not mention homosexuals.</p>\n<p>What he never said and what is often left out of any such debate, is that the constitution does not mention the word heterosexual either.</p>\n<p>Gautam is part of a circle that is not merely biased, but is no different from a large section of society who see themselves as ‘obvious’ and ‘regular’ to a system, as well as in charge of it. Hence, anyone else is a beneficiary of what they dole out. Therefore, the constitution to them is heterosexual in nature and any person wishing to be included in that constitution need to be identified and defined as accepted within the parameters that they state. In short, they are the benchmark of everything, and all else has to fall in line.</p>\n<p>However, the constitution, without a doubt, was written keeping in mind diversity and inclusion for every citizen, whatever shape, size, colour, religious belief, sexuality, language they may be. This brings it down to individual choices and the many individuals that make up communities, regions or the nation at large. It was never one or the other.</p>\n<p>What is forgotten conveniently is that the laws that were made, or are to be made, are a reflection of this constitution. When the constitution refers to citizens and their fundamental rights, it includes us all. Having said that, the laws that follow, be it to protect women or children, are aimed at interpreting the larger purpose of fundamental rights even when none of them are defined as heterosexual or homosexual or if no specific gender binary is emphasised.</p>\n<p>People like the Gautam are representative of a feudal mindset soaked in patriarchy that wishes to control the system and a narrative that makes them so powerful where their sense of morality overrides the constitution and its ethos. The legacy created by such a mix is such that even victims don’t see the crimes committed against them and this is best represented by the acceptance of domestic violence and forced marriages.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/20708/love-gets-second-chance-as-supreme-court-moves-to-re-examine-verdict-on-homosexuality/\" title=\"Love Gets Second Chance as Supreme Court Moves to Re-examine Verdict on Homosexuality\" target=\"_blank\">Love Gets Second Chance as Supreme Court Moves to Re-examine Verdict on Homosexuality</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s not difficult for people like Gautam to build a following as there is a growing tendency to mix sin and religious beliefs with criminality. There is also no effort to even understand the irrelevance of the law or a law that is a result of a perceived ‘threat’ to a religious belief. Section 377 falls bang in the middle of such a reality. This, unfortunately, gives irrational minds and voices a place in what should be a logical, human rights debate.</p>\n<p>However upset and irritated one might be by the views of people like Gautam, most of us are truly liberals: ready to listen, engage, share our stories, draw similarities, invoke nature, define our identity, enjoy privacy and share spaces. When we seek our rights, we don’t wish to infringe on other people’s rights.</p>\n<p>As the SC said: “What is natural to one may not be natural to the other.”</p>\n<p>That is the charm of nature and the beauty of diversity that frees everyone to feel secure in themselves – so free that one doesn’t need to control anyone else.</p>\n<p><em><a title=\"Sharif Rangnekar\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/sharif-ranganekar/\">Sharif Rangnekar</a> is a communications consultant and a former journalist.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212199/section-377-bigotry-constitution-heterosexual-or-homosexual/\">Section 377, Bigotry and Why the Constitution Is Neither Heterosexual or Homosexual</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Most countries consider as illegal the<span> Israel</span>i settlements built in the territory which<span> Israel </span>captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>\n<p><span>Israel </span>disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>\n<p><span>Israel</span>i authorities were due to<span> approve </span>on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.</p>\n<p>There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian officials. The Palestinians say<span> Israel</span>i settlements in the<span> West </span><span>bank</span>, a key issue in peace talks, deny them a viable contiguous state.</p>\n<p>US-brokered peace talks between<span> Israel </span>and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by US President Donald Trump’s administration to restart them have shown little sign of progress.</p>\n<p>Asked about the construction plans, a US State Department official said there had been no change in policy on settlements and the<span> Israel</span>i government had made clear that going forward “its intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the president’s concerns into consideration.”</p>\n<p>“The US welcomes this. As the president has said repeatedly, the administration is firmly committed to pursuing a comprehensive peace between<span> Israel</span>is and Palestinians,” the US official said on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>The White House said on Monday US vice president Mike Pence will visit the region from January 20 to 23, embarking on a tour originally planned for December after Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of<span> Israel</span>.</p>\n<p>Pence will hold talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Jordan’s King Abdullah and <span>Israel</span>i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.</p>\n<p>Trump’s decision on Jerusalem and announcement in December that the US would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv enraged the Palestinians who said the US can no longer broker peace with<span> Israel</span>.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212416/israel-approve-hundreds-new-settler-homes-west-bank/\">Israel to Approve Hundreds of New Settler Homes in West Bank</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Sirius said in a statement its programming agreement was with<span> <em>Breitbart</em></span>, not with<span> Bannon</span>.</p>\n<p>In an effort to try to repair the damage<span> from </span>the book, <span>Bannon </span>said his “treasonous” comment was directed at a former<span> Trump </span>campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who also attended the meeting at <span>Trump </span>Tower. The author of the book, Michael Wolff, disputed<span> Bannon</span>‘s account.</p>\n<p>“<span>Bannon </span>died of his own sword,” said Roger Stone, a long-time<span> Trump </span>friend. “A classic example of hubris and beginning to think you are smarter than the boss.”</p>\n<p>Wolff’s book, <em><span>Fire </span>and Fury: Inside the<span> Trump </span>White House</em>, characterised<span> Trump </span>as mentally unstable, inept and unprepared for the presidency.</p>\n<p><span>After </span>publication of the book last week, major Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer, who owns a stake in<span> <em>Breitbart</em></span>, issued a statement distancing herself<span> from</span><span> Bannon</span>, saying she did not support his “recent actions and statements.”</p>\n<p><strong>Supported Roy Moore</strong></p>\n<p><span>Bannon </span>joined<span> <em>Breitbart</em> </span>in 2012 and helped raise the profile of the<span> news </span>site, which he once called the platform for the so-called alt-right, a loose confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.</p>\n<p>“I’m proud of what the<span> Breitbart </span>team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class<span> news </span>platform,”<span> Bannon </span>said in a statement cited by<span> <em>Breitbart </em></span><em><span>News</span></em>.</p>\n<p><span>Bannon </span>did not immediately respond to a request for comment<span> from </span>Reuters.</p>\n<p><span><em>Breitbart</em> c</span>hief executive Larry Solov, in a statement on the organisation’s website, called<span> Bannon</span>“a valued part of our legacy.”</p>\n<p>“We will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish,” Solov said.</p>\n<p><span>After </span>leaving the White House in August,<span> Bannon </span>picked a fight with the Republican establishment that may have cost the party a US Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama.</p>\n<p>He supported Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in his primary fight against incumbent Luther Strange, who was backed by<span> Trump </span>and mainstream Republicans.</p>\n<p>Moore won the primary but lost to Democrat Doug Jones in December’s general election<span> after </span>Moore was accused of sexual misconduct against teenagers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212330/bannon-steps-breitbart-news-drawing-fire-trump/\">Steve Bannon Steps Down From Breitbart News After Drawing Fire From Trump</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

No casualties were reported.</p>\n<p>Fresh<span> clash</span>es also broke out in Tebourba, a town 40 km (25 miles) west of Tunis where one protester was killed on Monday, witnesses said, and soldiers could be seen there and in Jelma, a central town where<span> clash</span>es were also reported.</p>\n<p>The main opposition party had hours earlier called for protests to continue until the government scrapped what it called an unjust 2018 budget including price and tax hikes.</p>\n<p>While Tunisia is widely seen as the only democratic success story among the nations where Arab Spring revolts took place in 2011, it has had nine governments since then and none of them have been able to tackle growing economic problems.</p>\n<p>Europe is concerned about stability in Tunisia, partly because unemployment there has forced many young<span> Tunisian</span>s to go abroad: The number of boats smuggling migrants to Italy has been rising and Tunisia has also produced the largest number of jihadists heading for battlefields in Iraq, Syria and Libya.</p>\n<p>Public anger has been building since January 1, when the government raised the prices of petrol and other items and hiked taxes on cars, phone calls, internet usage and hotel accommodation as part of those economic reforms.</p>\n<p>A year ago, the government agreed to a four-year loan programme with the International Monetary Fund worth about $2.8 billion in return for economic reforms.</p>\n<p>“Today we have a meeting with the opposition parties to coordinate our movements, but we will stay on the street and we will increase the pace of the protests until the unjust financial law is dropped,” opposition Popular Front leader Hamma Hammami told reporters.</p>\n<p>Adding to pressure on the government, Nourredine Taboubi, head of the labour union UGTT, demanded the minimum wage and aid for the poor be raised within a week, state news agency TAP said.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called for calm, saying the economy would improve this year. Chahed, who heads a coalition of Islamist and secular parties, has been under constant pressure from labour unions over the faltering economy.</p>\n<p>“People have to understand that the situation is extraordinary and their country is having difficulties, but we believe that 2018 will be the last difficult year for the<span> Tunisian</span>s,” Chahed said.</p>\n<p>The 2011 uprising and two major militant attacks in Tunisia in 2015 damaged foreign investment and tourism, which accounts for 8% of its economic activity.</p>\n<p><strong>‘Sacrificing the poor’</strong></p>\n<p>The demonstrations have so far been much smaller than previous protests since the overthrow of autocrat ruler Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.</p>\n<p>But those confrontations between the government, labour unions, Islamists and secular forces also started on a small scale before escalating.</p>\n<p>Analysts say Chahed could amend some of his reforms. Under pressure from unions, officials have already agreed to increase public sector salaries this year and to avoid compulsory lay-offs which could provoke protests.</p>\n<p>The government says it wants to cut the public sector wage bill to 12.5% of gross domestic product in 2020 from about 15% now by offering voluntary redundancies.</p>\n<p>But it is also trying to impose higher petrol prices and contributions to social security, which are tough for many people to swallow after years of hardship.</p>\n<p>“At the time of Ben Ali, which we did not like, I filled my stand with vegetables, fruits and other items with 10 dinars, and now 50 dinars do not fill this gap. The situation has worsened dramatically,” said Fatma, a market woman in a Tunis.</p>\n<p>“The government is sacrificing the poor and the middle class by raising prices and ignoring tax evaders and businessmen,” she said.</p>\n<p>Separately, a judge ordered the arrest of a finance ministry official on suspicion of graft, another judge said, the first such move against a senior official since Chahed announced a crackdown last year.</p>\n<p>The country’s anti-corruption committee says graft is widespread. It has presented cases against 50 state officials accused of corruption.</p>\n<p>(<em>Reuters</em>)</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212372/unrest-continues-in-tunisia-police-clashes-with-protesters-in-capital/\">Unrest Continues in Tunisia, Police Clashes With Protesters in Capital</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Montecito needs your love and support.”</p>\n<p>Oprah Winfrey, who also lives in Montecito and had left her home during the wildfires, had not posted about the mudslides as of Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>Some areas of Santa Barbara County early on Tuesday were pounded with more than a half-inch of rain in five minutes, a rate that far exceeds the normal flash flood threshold, officials said.</p>\n<p>“Where are the frogs and locusts? We’re waiting for them,” Dominic Shiach, a restaurateur from Montecito who evacuated due to last month’s fire, said by telephone. He lives just outside the latest evacuation zone.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212373/thirteen-killed-california-mudslide-area-already-ravaged-wildfire/\">Thirteen Killed in California Mudslide in Area Already Ravaged by Wildfire</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque</p></div>\n<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The US Environmental Protection Agency will<span> replace </span>Obama-era carbon and clean<span> water </span><span>regulations </span>and open up a national debate on<span> climate </span>change in<span> 2018</span>, part of a list of priorities for the year that also includes fighting lead contamination in public drinking<span> water</span>.</p>\n<p>The agenda, laid out by<span> EPA a</span>dministrator Scott Pruitt in an exclusive interview with Reuters on Tuesday, marks an extension of the agency’s efforts under President Donald Trump to weaken or kill<span> regulations </span>the administration believes are too broad and harm economic growth, but which environmentalists say are critical to human health.</p>\n<p>“The<span> climate </span>is changing. That’s not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100?… I think the American people deserve an open honest transparent discussion about those things,” said Pruitt, who has frequently cast doubt on the causes and implications of global warming.</p>\n<p>Pruitt reaffirmed plans for the<span> EPA </span>to host a public debate on<span> climate </span>science sometime this year that would pit<span> climate </span>change doubters against other<span> climate </span>scientists, but he provided no further details on timing or which scientists would be involved.</p>\n<p>Pruitt said among the<span> EPA</span>’s top priorities for<span> 2018 </span>will be to<span> replace </span>the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama’s centerpiece<span> climate </span>change regulation which would have slashed carbon emissions from power plants. The<span> EPA </span>began the process of rescinding the regulation last year and is taking input on what should<span> replace </span>it.</p>\n<p>“A proposed rule will come out this year and then a final rule will come out sometime this year,” he said. He did not give any details on what the rule could look like, saying the agency was still soliciting comments from stakeholders.</p>\n<p>He said the agency was also planning to rewrite the<span> Water</span>s of the United States rule, another Obama-era regulation, this one defining which US<span> water</span>ways are protected under federal law. Pruitt and Trump have said the rule marked an overreach by including streams that are shallow, narrow, or sometimes completely dry – and was choking off energy development.</p>\n<p>Pruitt said that in both cases, former President Barack Obama had made the rules by executive order, and without Congress. “We only have the authority that Congress gives us,” Pruitt said.</p>\n<p>Pruitt’s plans to<span> replace </span>the Clean Power Plan have raised concerns by attorneys general of states like California and New York, who said in comments submitted to the<span> EPA </span>on Tuesday that the administrator should recuse himself because as Oklahoma attorney general he led legal challenges against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Biofuels and Staff Cuts</strong></p>\n<p>Pruitt said he hoped for legislative reform of the US biofuels policy this year, calling it “substantially needed and important” because of the costs the regulation imposes on oil refiners.</p>\n<p>The Renewable Fuel Standard, ushered in by former President George W. Bush as a way to help US farmers, requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply every year.</p>\n<p>Refining companies say the<span> EPA</span>-administered policy costs them hundreds of millions of dollars annually and threatens to put some plants out of business. But their proposals to change the program have so far been rejected by the Trump administration under pressure from the corn lobby.</p>\n<p>The<span> EPA </span>in November slightly raised biofuels volumes mandates for<span> 2018</span>, after previously opening the door to cuts.</p>\n<p>The White House is now mediating talks on the issue between representatives of both sides, with input from<span> EPA</span>, and some Republican senators from states representing refineries are working on possible legislation to overhaul the program.</p>\n<p>Pruitt said he also hoped Congress could produce an infrastructure package this year that would include replacing municipal<span> water </span>pipes, as a way of combating high lead levels in certain parts of the United States.</p>\n<p>“That to me is something very tangible very important that we can achieve for the American people,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pruitt added that<span> EPA </span>also continuing its review of automobile fuel efficiency rules, and would be headed to California soon for more meetings with the California Air Resources Board to discuss them.</p>\n<p>California in 2011 agreed to adopt the federal vehicle emission rules through 2025, but has signaled it would opt out of the standards if they are weakened – a move that would complicate matters for automakers serving the huge California market.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Pruitt said<span> EPA </span>is continuing to reduce the size of its staff, which fell to 14,162 employees as of January 3, the lowest it has been since 1998, under Ronald Reagan when the employment level was 14,400. The<span> EPA </span>employed about 15,000 when Obama left office.</p>\n<p>Nearly 50% of the<span> EPA </span>will be eligible to retire within the next five years, according to the agency.</p>\n<p>(<em>Reuters</em>)</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212348/obama-era-climate-water-regulations-to-be-replaced-by-trumps-epa-in-2018/\">Obama Era Climate, Water Regulations to Be Replaced by Trump’s EPA in 2018</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

We must listen, we must hear. We must provide answers within our means,” Khamenei was quoted as saying, hinting that not only the government of Rouhani, but his own clerical<span> leader</span>ship must also respond.</p>\n<p>“I am also responsible.

Credit: The Wire</p></div>\n<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> All roads leading to the Parliament Street police station in New Delhi were blocked on Tuesday (January 9). Hundreds of police personnel, several barricades and water cannons and numerous units of Rapid Action Force guarded this section of the street. Yet people found their way through the narrow creek-like lanes, left open only for pedestrians, to join the Yuva Hunkar rally – a protest called by several young and independent leaders against what they called the Narendra Modi government’s “anti-people” policies.</p>\n<p>Until yesterday afternoon, confusion prevailed among participants over whether the rally was actually happening or not. Several media houses on January 8 ran the story that the the meeting was denied permission by the Delhi police. This came after the deputy commissioner of police New Delhi tweeted about it, tagging various news agencies:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">No permission granted so far by Delhi Police to hold proposed protest at Parliament Street in view of NGT orders.

Prashant Bhushan, eminent lawyer and one of the speakers at the event, was quick to point out that the DCP’s tweet was misleading.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Please don’t mislead people <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DCPNewDelhi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" title=\"@DCPNewDelhi\" target=\"_blank\">@DCPNewDelhi</a>.NGT orders are for Jantar Mantar, not Parliament St. SC has always held right to peaceful protest meetings is a fundamental right.

The DCP, on the other hand, did not give any clarification on his tweet, even as a section of the media echoed his view.</p>\n<p>However, at the venue, the police let the rally happen in a peaceful way. Since the event was a fully organised affair – pre-erected tents, hundreds of chairs, loudspeakers and a power-generator – it led to many activists alleging that the Delhi police and a section of the media had deliberately spread misinformation about the rally.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Rather than asking us why we are going ahead with the rally “despite not having permission”, media should ask the Delhi Police why they kept lying about cancellation of permission.

Along with this, the events will also try to bring young men and women under one oppositional umbrella against increasing right-wing violence on Muslims and Dalits.</p>\n<p>Leaders like Jignesh Mevani, Shehla Rashid, Umar Khalid, Akhil Gogoi, Kanhaiya Kumar, Richa Singh, Manoj Manzil and many others spoke at yesterday’s event to launch the nation-wide independent protests.</p>\n<p>“I believe in a sewing machine. I am here to unite the people who have been left scattered because of 22 years of BJP’s divisive politics in Gujarat. They (Hindutva activists) talk about love <em>jihad</em>. I talk about only love. We will celebrate both April 14 (Ambedkar’s birth anniversary) and February 14 (Valentine’s Day),” shouted Mevani, as his microphone kept malfunctioning.</p>\n<p>“In the name of <em>ghar wapsi, </em>cow protection and love jihad, the government is trying to deflect attention from issues of <em>roti, kapda, makaan, shiksha aur chikitsa </em>(bread, cloth, shelter, education and health). A conspiracy to manufacture a fake enemy is going on these days. Let me tell the government – that you keep taking the side of Adanis and Ambanis and we will keep talking about issues of Dalits, Adivasis, minorities and the poor,” he said as he invoked the violence against Dalits at Bhima Koregaon, Una and Saharanpur.</p>\n<p>“I want to ask the prime minister: what would he choose between<em> Manusmriti</em> and the Indian constitution?” he said while repeatedly alleging that the government had initiated an unprecedented crackdown on its opposition.</p>\n<p>“Why did the police fire on protesting farmers in Madhya Pradesh? Why are students being treated as criminals? Why are leaders like Chandrasekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ of Bhim Army and Assam-based activist Akhil Gogoi facing the National Security Act? Where is there no action against Najeeb Ahmed’s (the JNU student who disappeared 15 months ago) disappearance?” asked the recently-elected MLA from Vadgam, Gujarat, asserting that he will keep raising questions about such issues both in the Gujarat assembly and on the streets.</p>\n<p>JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar said that the BJP did not want to save India’s democracy but the interests of corporate groups.</p>\n<p>“We are not against any particular caste or religious group. We only demand that that democratic and constitutional values should be implemented. Democracy has given us the right to speech and dissent. The BJP does not want Ram<em> rajya </em>as it claims. It only wants to divide the Hindus and Muslims. You must understand that in the fight between Hindus and Muslims, only Nathruam Godse (Mahatma Gandhi’s murderer) will win. They (the Sangh <em>parivar) </em>says that god exists in every human. So didn’t god exist in Afrazul (the migrant worker who was <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/202831/rajasthan-muslim-man-hacked-to-death-video/\" title=\"brutally hacked to death\" target=\"_blank\">brutally hacked to death</a> in Rajsamand, Rajasthan recently)?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“The RSS regards Tulsi Das as a great poet. I oppose his <em>shloka </em>where he said illiterates, Shudras, women and untouchables should always be dismissed. But I also want to ask the RSS: the same poet had also said that Ravan fought on a chariot while Ram took him on with bare feet. What was then (L.K.) Advani <em>ji</em> doing on a chariot?” Kumar said, referring to Advani’s infamous<em> rath yatra</em> during the Ram <em>janmabhoomi</em> movement in the 1990s.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xn_Pa4woC8\" height=\"500\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>Similarly, JNU student leader Shehla Rashid asked, “Adityanath, who has hundreds of cases against him, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/208455/bjp-uttar-pradesh-adityanath/\" title=\"withdrew all of them\" target=\"_blank\">withdrew all of them</a> when he became the chief minister. But he has the gall to slap National Security Act on Chandrasekhar who stood for the rights of Dalits.”</p>\n<p>“When the young people of India organise a rally, then the police comes to arrest them. They are charged with sedition. But when Shambhulal Regar (who allegedly killed Afrazul) is arrested, Bajrang Dal activists take the court premises hostage, hoist a saffron flag in the court but let alone sedition, the police doesn’t charge them with even minor sections,” she said, while saying that she and other leaders would directly be in contact with the youth without depending on any external agency like the media.</p>\n<p>Bhim Army’s president Vinay Ratan Singh said that he wanted to establish the Bhim Army across India and will protest to get Chandrasekhar released. “When Dalits and other marginalised groups show their strength on streets, only then RSS’s divisive politics can be defeated.”</p>\n<p>Student leader from Bihar Manoj Manzil  said that the education system in India is a mess and the government is doing nothing to address the problems of common students. “The RSS cheated the country during the freedom struggle by discreetly brokering deals with the British.  All they did was to spread hate. It supported crooks like Ram Rahim (of Dera Sacha Sauda), so how can we expect jobs and social justice from this government? I will work in Bihar to unite the youth so that this arrogant government can be defeated.”</p>\n<p>Former Allahabad University leader and currently a part of the Samajwadi Party, Richa Singh said, “When Indira Gandhi had declared emergency, then the young people of India ensured that she was defeated. If the Modi and Yogi governments think that they can destroy this movement, then they should understand that the youth will unite and ensure its downfall. Our fight is from Saharanpur to Nagpur. And we will not stop.”</p>\n<p>Assam’s farmers’ leader and activist Gogoi spoke out against Hindutva ideology. “Under the Modi government, farmers, youth, Dalits and backward classes are being attacked, but it is only working towards turning India into a Hindu rashtra. Assam is a beautiful state where all communities live together but even there, the BJP is pitting the Hindus against Muslims. It wants Bangladeshi Hindus to come to Assam and drive the Muslims out of the state to strengthen its vote bank.</p>\n<p>The leaders announced that in the next few months, they would constitute teams to organise rallies in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212316/yuva-hunkar-rally-youth-leaders-modi-govt/\">Delhi’s ‘Yuva Hunkar’ Rally Only the Beginning, Say Youth Leaders Protesting Modi Govt Policies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Krupa Kumaresan</p></div>\n<p>Even in prose, Sharanya Manivannan’s writing never loses its lyricism, and never lets you forget that she is an accomplished poet. In her second book of poems, <em>The Altar of the Only World</em>, she wields this lyricism to trace the journeys of three mythological characters – Sita, Lucifer, Inanna – and through them, the defining experience of finding one’s way back to oneself, back to life, after heartbreak.</p>\n<p>These are no ordinary characters, and this is no ordinary heartbreak; like Inanna’s journey into the underworld, like Sita’s embrace of the Earth, and like Lucifer’s fall from the heavens, this journey is transformational.</p>\n<p>The beloved here in almost incidental. It is the experience of love, and through that, the mystical and sacred experience of knowing one’s own soul, one’s own capacity for love and wisdom, that is central. The writer and poet spoke to <em>The Wire</em> about the process of writing this collection. Edited excerpts from the interview:</p>\n<p><strong>You have dedicated this book to Veenapani Chawla. Can you tell us more about your relationship with her and how she impacted your work?</strong></p>\n<p>Veenapani was a visionary theatre artist who founded the Adishakti campus outside Pondicherry. She passed away in 2014. When I first visited Adishakti, I was 23 years old and freshly grieving the loss of my grandmother, and it was a time of a lot of tumult in my life. Being in that strange, forest-like campus for a month had a transformative effect on me – both curative and devastating.</p>\n<p>To begin with, the power of nature was so profoundly tangible there. I would literally weep into Earth. I also developed an admiration for what she had created artistically. Adishakti’s pedagogy is legendary, and Veenapani created it through intense study. Meeting her, being there, completely changed the trajectory of my life. I saw what was possible: devotion to art, nature and divinity. And the concept of absolute sovereignty. That you did not have to be shorn of love, desire or companionship just because you rejected the paradigms of a conventional life. Or had that conventional life reject you. And her generosity – my goodness.</p>\n<p>Like so many iconoclastic women, she was the subject of intense jealousy both during her life and posthumously. She was a powerhouse. She was gentle, she was sweet, she was childlike too. And I think I was very childlike around her, for I often fell silent in admiration. But she knew my poems. She wore Fabindia shirts in a men’s size 36, and I would bring her one as a gift each time. One night, I saw her refuse to take a knife from someone’s hand and I adopted the superstition immediately.</p>\n<p>The last time I saw her, I was wearing a blue tank top and she was walking out for her morning swim. And she called out to me, “Hello, blue girl”. The day she died, I was in Chennai and a blue butterfly came into my room and sat on my head. I did not go to her funeral. But I think I was forgiven.</p>\n<p>I suppose all of this is really to say: I cannot separate the influence on my work from the influence on my life.</p>\n<p><strong>You have said that this book is about the afterlife of love. I would like to ask a series of questions around this theme. </strong><strong>So many of the poems portray the wisdom that is gained from loss, particularly loss of love, but the healing in them is not linear. Instead, great pain and immense generosity exist side by side. Can you talk about the messiness of emerging from heartbreak? It’s a shift in paradigm, isn’t it – if the heartbreak is acute enough?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141210/The-Altar-of-the-Only-World-15-copy.jpg?fit=1524%2C2339\" data-orig-size=\"1524,2339\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141210/The-Altar-of-the-Only-World-15-copy.jpg?fit=195%2C300\" data-attachment-id=\"212086\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141210/The-Altar-of-the-Only-World-15-copy.jpg?resize=307%2C471&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212010/i-painted-universal-writer-poet-sharanya-manivannan-latest-book-poetry/the-altar-of-the-only-world-15-copy/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141210/The-Altar-of-the-Only-World-15-copy.jpg?fit=667%2C1024\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"The-Altar-of-the-Only-World-15-copy\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212086\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sharanya Manivannan <br><em>The Altar of the Only World</em><br>HarperCollins, 2017</p></div>\n<p>Absolutely. There is a kind of heartbreak that changes your life because it kills you, and you’re reborn. That will seem hyperbolic only to those who haven’t experienced it. And there are other kinds: heartbreaks that teach, heartbreaks that mislead and manipulate, heartbreaks that deepen one’s sensory understanding of the world, heartbreaks that deepen one’s political understanding of the world, heartbreaks that deepen one’s capacity to love the world.</p>\n<p>There are so many kinds, and unless one operates consistently from a place of fear and barricades (and actually, sometimes all the more if so), one experiences so many variations.</p>\n<p>Heartbreak is also a palimpsest. Each time afterwards, one retraces that journey. It’s a shadow under the fresh pain. It doesn’t always sting or throb, but it’s there.</p>\n<p><strong>There is also often a lot of compassion for the limitations of the lover, and many things to be gained from the loss of the lover. Could you elaborate on this?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s ultimately this: who the lover was, what they did to you, what they could not or cruelly refused to do, doesn’t matter. It matters only at the burning start of the heartache, but ultimately the journey is made only by you, and the projection, shadow or echo you choose to have accompany you. I say choice as though one has control over it, but one doesn’t. You have to walk far way into that journey before choices really come to you.</p>\n<p>You feel love only as deeply as your heart has the capacity to bear. How you love speaks only for who you are. Not for who you love, not for who receives or refuses it.</p>\n<p>Let me put this another way in less esoteric terms. I have no feeling, no sentiment, for the one who broke my heart when I first started to write this book. I forgive the last one who broke my heart because I know he made the best choices for himself, but it was wrong of him to not have asked for my forgiveness before I gave it to him. My pain burned like camphor, burned and burned until it evaporated.</p>\n<p>But who are these people? It doesn’t matter. There are these poems. There is my life. And there are other people, other lovers, that someone who reads this book will see in its pages. Their own projections, shadows, echoes – and reflections. Who is more important then, tell me – the lover, or the one left behind?</p>\n<p><strong>Often the love in the poems appears to be a kind of perfected love, not in its reality, but certainly in its intensity, and the rawness with which the protagonists feel it. This is a life-changing love. What happens after such a love ends?</strong></p>\n<p>It dies in fits and starts. It dies a little when they show you their true face. It dies a little when they push you away. It dies a little when they do something irrevocable. And still it thrums in you, in you alone, even when it dies in the most painful place of all: your imagination, your heart. So there is that aftermath, first of all. The aftermath of separating from the beloved, and gasping for air as you struggle to believe and accept there are no more memories to be made, no more love to be lived. And the aftermath itself is long. Which I suppose is where the question of intensity vs reality comes into play. It’s gone, it’s impossible, it can never be – so why does it still fill your being?</p>\n<p>That’s really where the psychic landscape of the book is. And one can wander in that place for a long time. Some loves let you go with an eventual, unexpected gentleness. Others wake you in the night with dreams you should not still be having years after. What part of you wandered back through time and space to spend the night in that old hunting ground? I think Cher asked the right question. “Do you believe in life after love?” I do. Oh, I do. And I also believe in love. Eternal and otherwise.</p>\n<p>Someone asked me a beautiful question after I read from the book at a college last month. They wanted to know who the beloved in the final poems is. This was astute, as I thought I had concealed this well, a little balm after the harrowing journey. There is someone who comes, “breeze-like,/ infusing these quiet afternoons/ with your susurrus”, who the narrator names as “precious one” in the last poem.</p>\n<p>This was something I wanted to keep just as open-ended as who the betrayer addressed in most of the book is (is it Ravana, Rama, Hanuman? The poems deliberately confuse). But there is someone ultimately, a companion if not a lover, an animal if not a nature spirit if not a human being, and I believe this to be true of life as well. It’s a mistake to primarily seek lover after lover, partner after partner, because to do so allows one to live only in one element, one role. There are other modes of loving and being. There are ways of knowing oneself that don’t require from you the self-destruction, the effacement, of those devastating loves and seductions.</p>\n<p><strong>This book shares lot of the concerns (love and consequence) and approaches (the use of mythology) of your last book, <em>The</em> <em>High Priestess Never Marries</em>. Do you think they can be read as companions?</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps. I wrote <em>The High Priestess Never Marries</em> in five years, contained within the nine years in which I wrote <em>The Altar of the Only World</em>. Any work of art contains its maker’s experiences and preoccupations. To my mind they are very distinct works. I think <em>Altar</em> has a darkness that <em>Priestess</em> circumvents. But a reader may certainly see the overlap.</p>\n<p>To return to my answer to your prior question, the way both books end is certainly in simpatico. The privileging of romantic love, sexual partnership or the contract of marriage over all other bonds is something I reject. So Shyama, the protagonist of the last story in <em>Priestess</em>, “Sweetness, Wildness, Greed”, speaks of how her friends were her significant others through a decade of unpartneredness.</p>\n<p>And our Sita-Lucifer-Inanna composite speaks to a precious someone who walks alongside her in the sanctuary she has built fertilised by the ashes of who she once was. I wrote the poems ‘After Everything’ and ‘Gathering’ with two particular friends of mine in mind, loves of my life.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141803/Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-2.17.35-PM.png?fit=908%2C789\" data-orig-size=\"908,789\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141803/Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-2.17.35-PM.png?fit=300%2C261\" data-attachment-id=\"212089\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141803/Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-2.17.35-PM.png?resize=908%2C789&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212010/i-painted-universal-writer-poet-sharanya-manivannan-latest-book-poetry/screen-shot-2018-01-09-at-2-17-35-pm/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09141803/Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-2.17.35-PM.png?fit=908%2C789\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-2.17.35-PM\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212089\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sharanya Manivannan. Credit: Anjan-Kumar</p></div>\n<p><strong>Some of the poems centre dance/theatre/performance in their tellings – could you share what these arts mean to you and why they’re important to your poetry?</strong></p>\n<p>I just love art in all its forms, and although literature is my abode, I feel the way we perceive artistic canons is all wrong. Among the Ramayanas I studied, what moved me most were what exist in folksongs and little known variations. Which is why Sita in <em>Altar</em> experiences déjà vu as she flies over Lanka for the first time, in the poem ‘Daughter By Blood And By Way Of Sea And Sky’. Her origin story, to me, is the one in which Mandodari, Ravana’s wife, consumes a grail of blood kept for a sacrifice and becomes pregnant. She then sets the baby into the sea in a basket, like Moses or Karna (my first mythological love, who featured heavily in my first book of poems, <em>Witchcraft</em>).</p>\n<p>This story is also what allows Draupadi to enter the book and speak to Sita in the poem ‘Fire-Forged, Blood-Born’, for Draupadi too was born of similar dark magic. That to me was the singular link between these two epic heroines, who otherwise are very dissimilar. This is my Sita. Not a docile goddess born <em>ayonija</em> – miraculously, literally “in the absence of a cunt”. The traditional, monolithic understanding of Sita cannot, in my view, be rehabilitated to fit modern feminist expectations without essentially having her be written into a new character. But freeing her from the bonds of the canonical complicates her enough for us to see ourselves in her, and therefore have empathy for ourselves.</p>\n<p>These stories come to us as oral renderings, and therefore as performances. One doesn’t have to look far to find the non-canonical. Tamil Nadu, where I live, has long had a tradition of sympathy if not a feeling of glory for Ravana. The cover of <em>Altar</em> was inspired by shadow puppetry, and in Kerala, these performances present the Tamil Kambaramayanam alongside Malayalam commentary. So for instance, in the Surpanakha sequence, there is room for her side of the story. She can discourse on desire. She can discourse on consent. She can perhaps even discourse on assault. I have heard of a Wayanad Ramayana in which Sita returns to her natal home in Mithila. There’s a Bhojpuri folksong in which she rejects the engagement. When we say subversion, we only mean subverting the sanctioned.</p>\n<p>The truest tellings of these tales sprout from the heart, from the hearth and from labour. How fortunate we are that some of them are preserved, even if only in the form of rumours and excerpts. May they prosper. May they multiply.</p>\n<p><strong>There is also the major theme of art itself bringing the protagonists back to themselves, no matter what heartache they have to endure. How does the process of creating and communing with art figure in this journey?</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps this is a mirror-within-mirror optical illusion. Art allowed – allows – me to endure. If I couldn’t make it, I could consume it. And in the case of the Inanna poems, it is incantation that allows survival and escape from death. Language is intent. She intends to live. Her words allow passage back into the world.</p>\n<p><strong>The poems are quite often literally cosmic in nature – love and its consequences play out in the stars, as stardust, in the constellations, as the sun and the moon. You are working closely with the stories of three mythological characters – Sita, Inanna and Lucifer – so it isn’t surprising that the relationships in the poems seem archetypal in nature – but could you expand on the cosmic scale of these tellings?</strong></p>\n<p>If Sita was Earth and the forest and the element of fire, Lucifer opened up the heavens to me. The word ‘Lucifer’ is Latin for light-bearer, and he is associated with Venus as the morning star (which was what led me to Inanna, who is the same). It was easy then to understand Lucifer’s exile on cosmic terms, if not on a cosmic scale: a literal casting from heaven, the burning out of a star, the sorrowful hum of a pulsar as it implodes.</p>\n<p>I see the three mythic figures as well as the composite character that emerges in the book as absolutely archetypal, yes. For the experience of heartbreak is universal. The Jungian possibilities of mythology are very interesting to me, because I believe much of the key to healing lies within stories and how we tell them.</p>\n<p>So for instance, why did a character like Sita, which feminism cannot really rehabilitate, appeal to me? I think it’s because I didn’t see the context or the trappings when that appeal first occurred. I didn’t see the crown, or the consort, or the signet ring or the kidnapping or even the trials by fire. I saw only the interior emotion: abandonment, rejection, unrequited love. So Sita could be anyone. Sita is everyone. On the canvas of her story and through the vocabulary of her motifs, I painted the universal.</p>\n<p><i><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/shreya/\" title=\"Shreya Ila Anasuya\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Shreya</span> <span>Ila</span> <span>Anasuya</span></a> is a writer of fiction and non-fiction.

Credit: Twitter</p></div>\n<p>As the 62nd Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) at the UN in New York draws near, women from every corner of the world will convene to deliberate on the theme of CSW 2018: Challenges and Opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls. This year, the theme of empowerment has added significance. The #MeToo movement has shocked our collective conscience and made it impossible to ignore that empowerment goes far beyond economic agency.</p>\n<p>Women’s economic empowerment has enormous consequence. McKinsey Global’s research shows that gender equality adds 12 trillion dollars to the global economy, yet women are conspicuously absent from boardrooms and in some communities, school rooms. The evidence is now clear when women are absent from the marketplace, the market suffers. Although the cost analysis is important, the Me too movement has helped unmask the way in which sometimes, women’s economic participation pays lip service to women’s power, while serving those in power. Feminism’s urgent charge is not to commodify women through glossy stories and data, but to pierce those veils to identify the underlying power structures and structural barriers that prevent women’s access to and retention in the market.</p>\n<p>Feminism’s newest avatar, “economic feminism,” poses a complicated challenge to the pursuit of gender-equality around the world. By providing legal economic rights to women, empowerment is framed as voluntary and structural barriers are normalised. Entrepreneurial women are proudly paraded as proof of gender equality, a by-product of a transformation in the culture that sees value in women. In this cultural shift, if a woman is not in the marketplace, it is because she has made a choice not to work, and not because of debilitating structural inequalities. This thinking masks patriarchy’s power over women.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/191500/me-too-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment/\" title=\"#MeToo Campaign Showed That Misogyny is a Deeply Cultural Issue.

Here’s Why It Was Sorely Needed</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>“Economic feminism” in its unquestioned authority, can pose a threat to women’s advancement around the world. The importance attached to economic instrumentalist arguments for women’s rights can hide unexamined challenges. Without a doubt, the plethora of recent research from the IFC and McKinsey Global confirming that gender equality significantly boosts economic growth is to be celebrated for giving a tangible economic reason for countries to improve the status of women. Unfortunately, this message has been warped by some economies, and economic policies such as Abenomics supplant important social change policies on sexual abuse and hold back feminism’s goal of full realisation of gender equality under law. The reality is that women continue to face inequality that goes beyond just economic opportunity.</p>\n<p>Several countries, including Japan have put forward “win-win” economic policies, but they ignore controversial and difficult social policies such as violence against women. This approach is similar to the nations that peddled the “Asian Values” theory in the 1990s. The better approach is to reveal the interconnectedness of women’s economic participation with equal protection of laws.</p>\n<p>In many corners of the world from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, women have unequal access to property and land. Women’s unequal access to citizenship, residency, inheritance, and decision-making in public and private often subordinate women’s economic participation.</p>\n<p>Gender equality in all laws, most importantly family laws, have a profound impact on shaping and advancing women’s economic participation. In many countries, laws that regulate women in their families require women to get permission from their husbands to travel and disallow married mothers to confer citizenship on their children. Several states have legislation that do not recognise women as heads of household and control their free movement. Laws around the world permit underage and forced marriage for girls. Every two seconds, a girl is forced into marriage. Women married as children will reach one billion by 2030.</p>\n<p>Martha Minow, the former Dean of Harvard Law School, has argued that the rules of family law construct not only roles and duties of men and women but can shape rules about employment and commerce and perhaps the governance of the state.</p>\n<p>Violence is one of the most insidious barriers to women’s economic empowerment. Where a woman suffers sexual and other forms of abuse, her capacity to work and function are severely impaired. Fortune estimates that it costs the US $500 billion, but the human cost cannot be computed. Even Fortune argues that when talking about equality, the focus should include violence—or, more specifically, violence against women. According to a McKinsey Global Institute, violence is one of the biggest factors holding American women and all other women back.</p>\n<p>Feminism’s and the Metoo movements power lies in its potential to disrupt seemingly immutable gender norms. The international women’s rights community, as it convenes in New York, cannot be swayed by the promise of economic opportunity alone, it must continue to press on issues of violence, sexual abuse and discrimination that disallow women from participating in an economic activity and inhibit their full empowerment.</p>\n<p><em>Rangita de Silva de Alwis is Associate Dean of International Affairs at University of Pennsylvania law School &amp; Advisor, UN SDG Fund.</em></p>\n<p><em>(IPS)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211983/metoo-movement-disrupts-creeping-commodification-feminism/\">Why the #MeToo Movement Disrupts the Creeping Commodification of Feminism</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Youtube</p></div>\n<p>The performance exhibited the everyday reality pertaining to the experiences of a man behind bars – from unpalatable food and water inside the jail to the system that makes bribing  wardens an inevitable actuality.</p>\n<p>Adding to this was former inmate Bilal Khan’s real-life demonstration of the blot that prison leaves on one’s life. “Whatever has been shown is real and a projection of our own experiences. Since we have been through it, it was easier to enact it,” said Golu, a former inmate and performer.</p>\n<p>Juxtaposed against this thread of the realities of prison was the theme of positivity – many prisoners, much like Malcolm X’s account says, have enough time on their hands to learn how to read and write, among other things.</p>\n<p>“In an atmosphere of negativity that is made worse because you do not have independence unlike the outside world, we indulged ourselves in drama. I practiced yoga and comforted those who seemed depressed,” says Dinesh Sharma, another former inmate, who, through his performance in <em>The Gallows Project</em>, showcased his determination to remain positive inside prison.</p>\n<p>Set against the above background was prison reforms activist Vartika Nanda’s recitation of poetry penned by incarcerated women in Tihar jail from her book <em>Tinka Tinka Tihar</em>. A poignant excerpt from a poem by Seema Raghuvanshi, an undertrial at Tihar, dealt with the latter’s imaginations in prison, in a world beyond the cells of Jail no. 6 in Tihar.</p>\n<p>Enacting Mirza Ghalib’s rumination on incarceration from <em>Quaid-e-Hayat</em>, a book based on the life of the Urdu poet, the performance by dastango Darain Shahidi featured the poet remembering the days of his childhood spent in the alleys of Akbarabaad (now Agra) – a pleasant world that had just drifted away in a blink of his eye.</p>\n<p>The concluding act was by Farooqui himself, where he narrated Oscar Wilde’s <em>The</em> <em>Ballad of Reading Gaol </em>about his experiences in prison – particularly about witnessing the sentencing and execution of a fellow inmate.</p>\n<p>“I saw the misery and helplessness that everyone goes through, when I was in prison. It is not a question of wrong or right but rather what one goes through,” said Farooqui when asked why he chose to do <em>The Gallows Project</em>. “I had read about so many writers, so many artists, who, after being imprisoned, left their writings, and such moving writings… It is time to showcase that again and make us reexamine the notion of punishment,” he added.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/shreya-valiramani/\" title=\"Shreya Valiramani\" target=\"_blank\">Shreya Valiramani</a> is a final year student at Jindal Global Law School, Sonepat, Haryana, and an intern with </em>The Wire<em>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212087/gallows-project-team-dastangois-rendition-experiencing-prison-death-penalty/\">Team Dastangoi’s Rendition of Experiencing Prison and the Death Penalty</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

I was kept naked, tied to a rope, my genitals and toes were given electric shocks, and a roller was run over my legs.” This is not the memory of a German concentration camp survivor, or of a torture victim in Congo. It is the testimony of a young resident of Anantnag in Kashmir, who was picked up and interrogated by the Special Operations Group of the Jammu and Kashmir State Police in 2004.<br>\nAnd this is just one among hundreds of similar testimonies presented in <a href=\"https://jkccs.wordpress.com/2017/05/04/structures-of-violence/\" title=\"Structures of Violence\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Structures of Violence</em></a>, a monumental study of state violence in Kashmir released two years ago by the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS). The report has been widely read in Kashmir, but studiously ignored by the Indian media.</p>\n<p>JKCCS was co-founded by Parvez Imroz and Parvez Khurram, two public-spirited lawyers who have done sterling work on human rights in Kashmir for many years. I met them on the occasion of my third visit to Kashmir last October, and spent some time with their team. The JKCCS researchers, many of whom are volunteers, share the spartan premises of a small office in Srinagar but they work with passion. While preparing this report they travelled far and wide,<br>\ncollected countless testimonies, submitted numerous RTI applications and tried their best to identify those guilty of human rights violations.</p>\n<p>Most of the torture victims who spoke in this harrowing report were not “militants”, as armed insurgents are called in Kashmir (the militants are simply killed, so their testimonies have been lost). Many of them are relatives or neighbours of suspected militants, who were thought to have information of interest, such as the whereabouts of militants. Others were accused of having sheltered militants, hidden weapons on their behalf or engaged in so-called anti-India activities. Others still, it seems, were just being punished for acts of rebellion or defiance.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"bookmark noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211649/kashmir-valley-unrest-pellet-guns/\" title=\"Why a Nine-Year-Old Kashmiri Boy Half Blinded by Pellets Doesn’t Want to Grow Up\" target=\"_blank\">Why a Nine-Year-Old Kashmiri Boy Half Blinded by Pellets Doesn’t Want to Grow Up</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Some aspects of the testimonies are extremely disturbing. The details of torture, for one, are unbearable. Significantly, the same methods are described again and again in different testimonies from multiple locations. This shows that the facts are not made up or exaggerated by the victims. It also means that torture in Kashmir is not a matter of occasional abuse perpetrated by drunk, deranged or disobedient army officers. It is planned, systematic and based on standard methods that must have official sanction. Many of the victims quoted in the report mention being stripped naked, beaten with sticks, held under water, trampled under heavy rollers, hung upside down and electrocuted – not for a few minutes, but for hours on end. Other standard methods include pulling out nails, inflicting burns (with cigarettes, rods, stoves or melted polythene) and stretching legs at 180-degree angle. Once in a while, an innovation is reported. For instance, one victim states that a hot needle was inserted in his penis.</p>\n<p>Another disturbing fact is that torture is not reserved for adult men – women are also tortured from time to time, and even children. One of the most horrific testimonies comes from a minor girl (perhaps 14 years old) in Palhallan: “The army and the gunmen were interested in the whereabouts of my neighbour who was a militant with HM [Hizbul Mujahideen]… First, the gunmen, on the instructions of Liyaqat, stripped me of all my clothes. Then they beat me with sticks, many of which kept getting broken. Then the two employed a thick roller on my legs. They poured melted polythene into my vagina. After that I lost consciousness.” Her brother, a 10th-grade pupil, was also badly tortured the same day. Like many victims’ families, these children’s family did not lodge a complaint as they “feared retaliation from Major Liyaqat.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KASHMIR-k0fD-621x414@LiveMint.jpg?fit=621%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"621,414\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KASHMIR-k0fD-621x414@LiveMint.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-attachment-id=\"157763\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KASHMIR-k0fD-621x414@LiveMint.jpg?resize=632%2C421&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/157722/jammu-and-kashmir-human-rights-violation-afspa-states/kashmir-k0fd-621x414livemint/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KASHMIR-k0fD-621x414@LiveMint.jpg?fit=621%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"AFSPA\" data-image-title=\"KASHMIR-k0fD–621×414@LiveMint\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-157763\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">J&amp;K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti had earlier been one of the most vociferous opponents of AFSPA due to human rights violations. Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p>Also disturbing is the realisation that torture is not just a matter of short-term pain, but also, quite often, a lifelong tragedy. Many victims suffer long-term health damage such as disability, impotence, depression or chronic pain. The costs of health care compound the economic loss due to reduced earning abilities. To this must often be added the cost of ransom money, prolonged litigation, or protection from further harassment. Some victims had to sell their land or other assets to cope with these losses and costs.</p>\n<p><em>Structures of Violence</em>, however, is not just a detailed account of torture and other acts of state violence (including sexual violence, enforced disappearance, extra-judicial killings and massacres). It is also an insightful analysis of the institutional structures that underlie this violence – not only the army, the para-military forces and the police but also sections of the judiciary and legislature. The analysis builds on the notion of “command responsibility”, that is, the idea that army and police officers are responsible for the actions of persons who act at their command. The report examines the command structures involved in the reported atrocities, and goes out of its way to identify and name responsible officers.</p>\n<p>The actions of these officers were made possible, in part, by a series of authoritarian laws, such as the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts (AFSPA) and Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA). These laws give the army and the police sweeping powers to arrest, detain, question and sometimes even kill offenders or suspected offenders. But this is only one part of the story. The other part is that the army and the police often go well beyond what is permissible under the law, with virtual impunity. For instance, none of these laws permit torture, yet torture is routine in Kashmir and (with rare exceptions) nobody is ever held accountable for it. The problem is not just the law, but also the climate of lawlessness and the impunity with which the security forces operate. To illustrate, the prosecution of army personnel under AFSPA requires the state government to seek the sanction of the central government. Sanction has never been<br>\ngranted so far, according to the state government’s response to an RTI application, presented in Annexure 8 of the report.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in some cases where the victims of torture did lodge formal complaints, monetary relief was granted or recommended by the courts. But despite the admission that torture had taken place, the perpetrators were protected by government authorities. The structures of violence also have economic aspects, such as institutionalised corruption. The families of the victims of incarceration and torture are routinely asked for money to secure the release of the victims. In some areas, arresting young men and then extorting ransom money seems to be good business for army or police officers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"bookmark noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/173758/kashmir-hurriyat-detention-psa/\" title=\"Detained Under Public Safety Act, 80-Year-Old Kashmiri Political Activist Completes a Year in Jail\" target=\"_blank\">Detained Under Public Safety Act, 80-Year-Old Kashmiri Political Activist Completes a Year in Jail</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Some of the methods discussed in the report bear an uncanny resemblance to similar patterns in other areas where counter-insurgency operations are taking place. Much like the Special Police Officers (SPOs) in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the so-called Ikhwanis have been deployed in Kashmir to outsource some of the security forces’ shady work to desperate local youth. These armed youngsters are often out of control and supplement their “official” work with criminal activities, such as extorting money or settling scores. Feared and reviled by the local population, they often end up being killed. Some of them were tortured or liquidated by their own handlers in the security forces, after they turned inconvenient.</p>\n<p>The <em>Structures of Violence</em> report does not deal with atrocities committed by the militants – that is not its subject matter. However, it is clear from some of the testimonies that militant outfits also commit atrocities from time to time. In Kashmir, as elsewhere, armed struggle has often had a corrupting influence. Judging from the report, it is not uncommon for youngsters to join a militant <em>outfit</em> with high ideals but later find themselves misusing their power, turning<br>\ninformers to protect themselves, joining the Ikhwanis, or returning to civilian life as corrupt politicians. The structures of violence extend beyond the state, but the state has a special responsibility to abide by the law and democratic principles.</p>\n<p>The atrocities described in the report happened in the past, from the early 1990s onwards. As I pored over it, I kept asking myself whether the same methods were still being used today. When I put this question to one of the JKCCS volunteers, she said, “Of course!”  If things have actually changed, let the government show some evidence of it, and also prosecute those responsible for past atrocities.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/jdreze/\" title=\"Jean Dreze\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Dreze</a> is a visiting professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212100/torture-testimonies-detained-youth-kashmir/\">A Never-Ending Nightmare in Kashmir</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Amnesty International</p></div>\n<p><strong>Srinagar:</strong> In a remarkable feat, 16-year-old Insha Mushtaq, who became the face of pellet victims who lost their vision during the 2016 uprising in Kashmir, has cleared her class 10 board examinations. The results were declared on January 9.</p>\n<p>The teen gave the examinations with the aid of a helper who wrote the answers as she dictated. Despite being declared ‘qualified’ in her mathematics paper, Insha will have to appear for it again as it was noted that ‘she needs to improve’.</p>\n<p>The news has spread joy in Kashmir. Insha’s father, Mushtaq Ahmad Lone, who was engaged as a driver with the state-run Motor Garages Department, started receiving congratulatory calls and messages soon after the results were declared and the news of Insha’s success began to spread online.</p>\n<p>“We are very happy today,” Lone tells <em>The Wire</em>, adding that Insha worked hard to memorise her lessons with the help of her teachers. Over the past year, Insha recorded the lessons she had with a home tutor, later listening to them again in order to memorise them. “Everyone supported her to continue her studies, including her teachers, classmates and our relatives,” says Lone.</p>\n<p>Soon after the news broke, social media congratulated her, with people sharing photos and calling her an inspiration for continuing to study despite the grievous pellet injuries she suffered.</p>\n<p><strong>Living in the dark</strong></p>\n<p>Insha was hit by pellets on the evening of July 11, 2016, three days after Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was killed when she opened a window to look outside her home in Sedow village of south Kashmir’s Shopian district.</p>\n<p>“I was at home when I was hit by hundreds of pellets, mostly on my face,” Insha was quoted as saying in an Amnesty International <a title=\"report\" href=\"https://thewire.in/177431/losing-sight-in-kashmir-amnesty-report-highlights-trauma-of-pellet-gun-victims/\">report</a> titled “Losing Sight in Kashmir”, on the impact of pellet-firing guns. The report had also noted that many school and university students who had been hit in the eyes continue to have learning difficulties.</p>\n<p>“They (pellets) even went inside my mouth,” Insha said. “I want the forces who fired the pellets to be punished, but I know the state does not care. I have no faith in their system.”</p>\n<p>Over 1,200 persons were reportedly hit by pellets in their eyes during the summer 2016 uprising which left them partially or completely blind. Nearly 14% of the pellet victims were below the age of 15.</p>\n<p>In its report, Amnesty International last year had called for a “complete and immediate ban” on the use of pellet shotguns in Kashmir. The report noted that the use of the shotguns in Kashmir had “blinded hundreds and killed at least 14 people since July 2016″.</p>\n<p>Despite undergoing treatment for months and several surgeries in New Delhi and Mumbai hospitals, Insha has not able to see anything even after she returned to Kashmir in February last year, only just a “faint light in my left eye and nothing in my right eye.”</p>\n<p>Before July 2016, she used to come home from school and first finish her homework before going out to play with her cousin sisters. Her favourite subjects in school were science, mathematics and physics. But July 11 changed her life forever, leaving her in darkness. Even though she’s started to get used to it.</p>\n<p>“Now I can’t even eat or go to bathroom without help. My school bag and my books are lying in a corner,” she says, disappointed at her immobility and her dependence on her parents. “I can’t look at my books again. I wish I could read again and go to my school again. Now I’m dependent on others.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t make out if it’s a day or night time as it’s all the same for me,” she says, adding that she hoped to resume her studies and attend school again. She also misses her classmates and friends.</p>\n<p>“But what I miss the most are my eyes,” she says.</p>\n<p>Insha has not lost hope despite losing her vision. Energetic, intelligent and articulate, she also spoke of what she could do with her life even if she could not see anything. When asked what she wants to become as she grows up, she said she had wanted to become a doctor. “Maybe I can be an engineer now,” she says with a bright smile.</p>\n<p><em><a title=\"Majid Maqbool\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/majid-maqbool/\">Majid Maqbool</a> is a journalist and editor based in Srinagar, Kashmir.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212302/blinded-pellets-2016-kashmiri-teen-insha-mushtaq-clears-class-10-boards/\">Blinded by Pellets in 2016, Kashmiri Teen Insha Mushtaq Clears Her Class 10 Boards</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

The man was Air Marshal Asghar Khan, who, true to his famous punctuality, had arrived for a prize distribution ceremony where I also got to meet him. The air marshal had retired several years ago but according to my uncle, “he arrives a good 15 minutes before any event he is invited to”. A few years later, Asghar Khan was to snap at the leaders of the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA) in a letter to the Jamat-e-Islami (JI) leader Professor Ghafoor Ahmed, chastising them for their tardiness and lamenting the fact that he has to unnecessarily wait for them for hours for the PNA meetings to start. The air marshal breathed his last on January 5. He was the subcontinent’s first jet pilot, the first native head of the Pakistan Air Force and one of the last political stalwarts of his country.</p>\n<p>Asghar Khan belonged to the Malikdin clan of the Pashtun Afridi tribe from Tirah but was born in Jammu where his father, an army officer, was stationed. He later went to the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College (RIMC), Dehradun. Asghar Khan first got his commission in the British Indian Army but then moved to the Royal Indian Air Force (IAF) and was commissioned as a pilot officer. His first posting was at the Peshawar base. He was later a flight commandant against the Japanese on the Burmese front and then had the unique distinction of soaring as the subcontinent’s first jet pilot in a Gloster aircraft. He met Sukarno of Indonesia who invited him to join their fight against the Dutch colonisers. Asghar Khan seriously considered the option and asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah for counsel. Jinnah advised him to work for the anticipated new country, Pakistan. When the subcontinent was partitioned he was stationed at Ambala as chief flight instructor. As fate would have it, his replacement, Wing Commander Nair, asked the PAF’s first chief Air Vice Marshal Allan Perry-Keene to have Asghar Khan and his family evacuated to Pakistan in the air chief’s plane. Perry-Keene obliged. Asghar Khan later said that the train he and his family were originally supposed to board for Pakistan from Ambala was attacked during the partition riots and there were no survivors.</p>\n<p><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09231243/asghar-khan-pakistan-observer.png?fit=696%2C510\" data-orig-size=\"696,510\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09231243/asghar-khan-pakistan-observer.png?fit=300%2C220\" data-attachment-id=\"212287\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09231243/asghar-khan-pakistan-observer.png?resize=404%2C296&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212284/asghar-khan-air-marshal-dogged-opponent-military-rule-pakistan/asghar-khan-pakistan-observer/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09231243/asghar-khan-pakistan-observer.png?fit=696%2C510\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"asghar-khan-pakistan-observer\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212287\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">In Pakistan, Wing Commander Asghar Khan commanded the PAF training school Risalpur, where he was host to the country’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the day the latter made his famous speech:” a nation without an air force is at the mercy of its enemies … PAF should be second to none”. Asghar Khan considered this to be his mandate. He became the first native air chief of the PAF and, at age 37, the youngest ever to lead it. He served two tenures as the air chief and retired a few months before the 1965 war with India. The PAF Academy Risalpur now bears his name. He later served as chief of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), from where he retired in 1968.</p>\n<p>Asghar Khan was the air chief at the time of the March 1965 Indo-Pak army skirmish in the Rann of Kutch. When he came to know about the battle, he immediately realised that the PAF’s closest base, Maripur (now Masroor), would be barely able to support an air effort in the Rann of Kutch. Asghar Khan picked up the phone and called his old batch-mate, Arjan Singh, who was serving as the IAF chief and convinced him to keep both the air forces out of the war. Asghar Khan told the Indian air chief that should the IAF get involved, the PAF would be compelled to respond elsewhere, thus broadening the theatre of war.  Singh consulted with Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and agreed with Asghar Khan’s suggestion. Both air chiefs took flak at home but ended up averting a disaster, though not for long.</p>\n<p>Asghar Khan used to lament the fact that the Pakistan army not only initiated every single one of the four wars with India but also kept the PAF in the dark about each one. In fact, after getting a whiff of General Ayub Khan’s misadventure in Kashmir, Asghar Khan tried to dissuade him by correctly advising that a provoked India is likely to respond along the border in an all-out war. But Ayub Khan, advised by his foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, pursued the intervention in Kashmir which precipitated the 1965 Indo-Pak war.</p>\n<p>Asghar Khan firmly believed that Pakistan does not face an offensive threat from India. His view was that for millennia, the subcontinent has been geopolitically introvert, not expansionist and that Pakistan has nothing to fear from India unless it keeps provoking its giant neighbour.</p>\n<p><strong>From the air to politics</strong></p>\n<p>Asghar Khan formally threw his hat into the political ring in November 1968 when he openly declared his opposition to the military dictator Ayub Khan.</p>\n<p>He was immensely popular among the urban classes when he led the anti-Ayub Khan campaign in both West and the then East Pakistan. He was considered a viable alternative first to Ayub Khan and later to Bhutto. When General Yahya Khan replaced Ayub Khan and imposed his own martial law, Asghar Khan opposed the military dictatorship again, this time returning his national awards Hilal-e-Pakistan and Hilal- Quaid-e-Azam, in protest.</p>\n<p>Ironically, his nemesis and the ostensible democrat, Bhutto served as a minister under both of those martial law regimes. In fact, Asghar Khan – a soldier to boot – had the unique distinction of opposing four martial regimes viz. Generals Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf. He was one of the few West Pakistani politicians to travel to Dhaka to meet Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rehman to find a solution to the East Pakistan crisis.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09230953/Sheikh-mujib-and-asghar-khan-twitter.png?fit=989%2C586\" data-orig-size=\"989,586\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09230953/Sheikh-mujib-and-asghar-khan-twitter.png?fit=300%2C178\" data-attachment-id=\"212286\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09230953/Sheikh-mujib-and-asghar-khan-twitter.png?resize=989%2C586&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212284/asghar-khan-air-marshal-dogged-opponent-military-rule-pakistan/sheikh-mujib-and-asghar-khan-twitter/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09230953/Sheikh-mujib-and-asghar-khan-twitter.png?fit=989%2C586\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Sheikh-mujib-and-asghar-khan-twitter\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212286\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheikh Mujib Rehman and Asghar Khan. Credit: Twitter</p></div>\n<p>In March 1969, he announced the formation of his Justice Party  at the residence of his friend and fellow RIMCian, the secular Baloch leader Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The Justice Party was later merged with several outfits to form the Pakistan Democratic Party but the merger did not work out due to the shenanigans of Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan. Asghar Khan later founded the Tehrik-e-Istaqlal (TI) but contested the 1970 elections as an independent and lost from Rawalpindi to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The honourable man that he was, he conceded his defeat instantly and wholeheartedly. However, when the PPP government blatantly rigged the 1977 elections, Asghar Khan protested along with the other PNA leaders like Maulana Mufti Mahmud, Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari and Begum Nasim Wali Khan, and became Bhutto’s worst nightmare. The Bhutto regime targeted Asghar Khan, his family and his party viciously. In addition to several arrests and house arrests, his Abbottabad residence was mysteriously burnt to the ground during those days, his brother-in-law was charged with treason and his party’s rallies were physically attacked by PPP goons.</p>\n<p><strong>Bhutto to Zia and after</strong></p>\n<p>The air marshal was wrongly maligned for inviting Zia-ul-Haq’s martial law by way of a letter, which he had written to the armed forces asking them to disobey any illegal orders of the junta and the Bhutto regime. The fact is that it was Bhutto himself who brought General Zia-ul-Haq to one of the final meetings with the PNA on July 1977, to dissuade them from asking for the army’s withdrawal from Balochistan and disbanding of the infamous Hyderabad tribunal under which he had incarcerated the nationalist Baloch and Pashtun leaders of the National Awami Party (NAP). Bhutto relied on the then ISI chief ,General Ghulam Jilani Khan, and used to call the corps commanders directly and frequently, to lobby them. While several of the PNA parties joined Zia-ul-Haq’s civilian cabinet, Asghar Khan’s TI kept away from the regime.</p>\n<p>After General Zia-ul-Haq toppled Bhutto, he threatened Asghar Khan that he would try him for sedition over that same letter that is maliciously cited even today as his ostensible support to the military. Ironically, Bhutto, who is considered the first elected prime minister of what remained of Pakistan after 1971, imposed an emergency one day after the country adopted its 1973 constitution, and suspended the very fundamental rights guaranteed by it. He organised a paramilitary force called the Federal Security Force (FSF) that was answerable only to him and was deployed to hound his political opponents. He imposed governor’s rule in Balochistan after dismissing the NAP’s elected government. He later incarcerated the NAP leaders on trumped up charges and eventually banned the party through a Supreme Court reference. Some charge Asghar Khan with calling for Bhutto’s hanging in a public rally at Attock. Be that as it may, there is no evidence whatsoever that he connived to have his nemesis physically eliminated. Asghar Khan was known for a stubborn streak and somewhat short temper but vengeance was not one his traits.</p>\n<p>Asghar Khan’s TI was one of the founding parties – along with the PPP led by Bhutto’s widow Begum Nusrat Bhutto and Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari – of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), launched against Zia-ul-Haq’s iron rule. At the height of Zia’s power, Asghar Khan defied him and traveled to Kabul to meet Afghanistan’s communist president Mohammed Najibullah. Upon his return, he wrote a series of articles lambasting the so-called jihad that Zia had unleashed and warned against its blowback for Pakistan. Asghar Khan contested the 1990 elections under the People’s Democratic Alliance, in partnership with Benazir Bhutto’s PPP. The famous Asghar Khan case against the former army chief Mirza Aslam Beg for interfering with the 1990 elections through distributing money illegally to favourite politicians, was yet another battle in his constant fight against the role of generals in politics.</p>\n<p>I had the good fortune of meeting the air marshal at the TI’s provincial offices in Sukarno Square, Peshawar, then managed by his vice president, Inamullah Khan. I last met him at a 2007 rally against General Pervez Musharraf’s regime in Islamabad, where I also got to share the stage with him. In his usual firm tone, terse tenor and husky voice, Asghar Khan chastised the other politicians that if they really wanted to do something against Musharraf they should be criss-crossing the country to run a proper movement, instead of all congregating in Islamabad.</p>\n<p>Asghar Khan was an odd man in the wheeling-dealing political crowd of Pakistan. Many Pakistani leaders, including the three-time prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif, started their career in the TI. Asghar Khan believed in sticking to his political ideals and in continuous action to achieve them even if an electoral victory remained elusive. His only election win came in the later-annulled 1977 elections but he remained a towering figure throughout his air force and political career, inspiring many with his upright stance and unblemished character. He used to say that electoral victory does not matter to him as his job is to tell the truth and the masses want to hear that truth. He will be fondly remembered for being a stellar officer and a gentleman politician.</p>\n<p><em>Mohammad Taqi is a Pakistani-American columnist; he tweets at @mazdaki</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212284/asghar-khan-air-marshal-dogged-opponent-military-rule-pakistan/\">Asghar Khan: From Air Marshal to Dogged Opponent of Military Rule in Pakistan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: PTI/Kamal Kishore</p></div>\n<p><b>New Delhi: </b>Jignesh Mevani, the face of new-found Dalit assertiveness in Gujarat, made his debut on the national political stage today with a rally here where he called the Narendra Modi government a “threat” to democracy and the constitution.</p>\n<p>Thumbing his nose at the Delhi police, which did not give official permission to the ‘Yuva Hunkar’ (roar of the youth) rally held to demand the release of UP Dalit activist Chandrashekhar Azad, Mevani used the platform to attack Modi over the “Gujarat model” of politics.</p>\n<p>“The 125 crore people of this country are watching that someone is not being allowed to speak for merely demanding the release of Chandrashekhar Azad and effective implementation of the constitution and two crore jobs for the youth,” he said.</p>\n<p>“If an elected representative does not have the right to do so, then this is the Gujarat model,” Mevani said to loud cheers from a crowd comprising student activists from Delhi, Lucknow and Allahabad, among other places.</p>\n<p>The 35-year-old MLA from Vadgam shot to prominence after he launched a campaign across Gujarat against the BJP following the 2016 incident in Una where Dalits were flogged by vigilantes for skinning a dead cow. With Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakor, he formed a troika that substantially helped revive the Congress’s fortunes in Modi’s home state.</p>\n<p>The rally – held on Parliament Street in the heart of the national capital where prohibitory orders are in force through the year – was primarily called to demand the release of Azad, the founder of Dalit outfit Bhim Army.</p>\n<p>Azad, 30, was arrested under the tough National Security Act over Thakur-Dalit clashes in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district last year.</p>\n<p>Though police restrictions ensured the crowd at the rally was not as large as had been expected, former and current JNU student leaders, including Kanhaiya Kumar, Shehla Rashid and Umar Khalid, were on the stage, metres away from the Parliament Street Police Station.</p>\n<p>Assam peasant leader and anti-graft activist Akhil Gogoi and senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan were also present, apart from students from JNU, Delhi University, Lucknow University and Allahabad University, among others.</p>\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4xn_Pa4woC8?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&start=67&wmode=transparent\" width=\"1160\" type=\"text/html\" height=\"683\"></iframe></div>\n<p>An organiser claimed the police and media had “created confusion” about the rally, which accounted for the modest turnout.</p>\n<p>A senior Delhi Police official said no “formal permission was given for the rally, but it was allowed to be held to maintain peace.</p>\n<p>“No formal permission was given for the rally but it was allowed in view of peace and law and order. We wanted to ensure law and order so it took place amid heavy police deployment,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mevani told the gathering he would stand against the politics of hatred and embrace constitutional values and the “politics of love”.</p>\n<p>“I believe in politics of unity. I believe in politics of love, not love jihad. Alpesh Thakor, Hardik Patel and I are being targeted because we demolished their (BJP) pride and arrogance in Gujarat… There’s a looming threat to our democracy and constitution today,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mevani attacked Modi and focused on issues such as the arrest of Azad and the death of Dalit student Rohith Vemula.</p>\n<p>“The prime minister has to reply to all these issues including Koregaon, incarceration of Chandrashekhar Azad, the murder of Rohith Vemula,” he said, referring to the Hyderabad student who committed suicide in 2016.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10000102/jignesh-mevani-pti.jpg?fit=4800%2C2969\" data-orig-size=\"4800,2969\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10000102/jignesh-mevani-pti.jpg?fit=300%2C186\" data-attachment-id=\"212299\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;PTI&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;New Delhi: Dalit leader and Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani during Youth Hunkar rally in New Delhi on Tuesday.

The BJP is not a party but a washing machine which cleanses criminal charges against its leaders.”</p>\n<p>He urged the youth, “No matter how much difficulty you undergo in life or anger you have, do not fall into their trap.”</p>\n<p>Kumar said, “Read any religious books and all of them say there is god in every person. The one who burnt Afrazul to death in Rajasthan has killed the god in him too.”</p>\n<p>Afrazul Khan was hacked and burnt to death in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district in December last year. In a video shared on social media, the accused, who was arrested, was seen declaring that he killed the man to save a woman from “love jihad”, warning that anyone challenging the majority community would “meet the same fate”.</p>\n<p>Kumar picked a line from Tulsidas’ poem and told the Narendra Modi government to choose between ‘Raavanraj’ and ‘Ramraj’.</p>\n<p>“Tulsidas, who the RSS respects, had said Ravan Rathi, Birath Raghuvira (Ravana on the chariot, Lord Rama on foot).</p>\n<p>BJP should choose between the two,” Kumar said.</p>\n<p>Speakers from various states narrated tales of atrocities and vowed to fight what they called BJP-RSS “fascism”.</p>\n<p>The gathering also raised slogans against some TV channels and booed a reporter, leading to police intervention.</p>\n<p>At one point of time, the sound system failed, prompting Mevani to liken it to Modi’s ‘niyat’ (intention).</p>\n<p>“This is like Modi’s niyat,” he said, to the crowd’s loud cheers.</p>\n<p>Kanhaiya said Mevani and the likes of him who had gathered at the event were not aiming for power.</p>\n<p>“We are here to tell people that we will be there for each other during difficult times,” he said.</p>\n<p>When asked which tag suited him the best – a Dalit leader or a youth leader – Mevani said, he along with other youth leaders would rise above caste and religion and raise the issues the youth was facing across the country.</p>\n<p>“Soon, we will expand by joining hands with progressive people and Ambedkarites. The presence of a youth leader from a Dalit family is also necessary,” Mevani said.</p>\n<p><strong>BJP sees Congress plot</strong></p>\n<p>The BJP reacted sharply to the rally, with Union minister and party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad saying that it was the Congress which had “spread hatred” in the country.</p>\n<p>“The nation is watching who is working to break it. It is the Congress which has spread hatred in the country for the longest period,” he told reporters, using the Congress’s association with Mevani to launch an attack on Rahul Gandhi.</p>\n<p>He said Mevani, supported by the Congress in the Gujarat Assembly polls, had joined hands with Umar Khalid, accused of raising anti-India slogans in JNU, and added that Gandhi had strengthened Mevani and his allies.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212293/yuva-hunkar-modi-government-threat-democracy-constitution/\">Yuva Hunkar: ‘Modi Government a Threat to Democracy, Constitution’</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p><strong>Pune:</strong> The relatives of Rahul Babaji Phatangade, the youth killed on January 1 during the violence that broke out at Bhima Koregoan near Pune, Maharashtra, have demanded that lawyer Ujjwal Nikam be appointed as the public prosecutor for the trial. Phatangade’s family, along with members of Maratha Kranti Morcha, held a press conference to call for speedy justice for all those who have suffered losses in the violence.</p>\n<p>Members of the Maratha Kranti Morcha also said that the government should give a time frame within which they would complete the investigation and give out compensations.</p>\n<p>Among those present at the press conference was Phatangade’s cousin Tejas Dhawale. “We want the police and government to arrest those responsible for Rahul’s death as soon as possible. We also want Ujjwal Nikam to be appointed as the public prosecutor to represent the government against those caused the violence and killed Rahul,” Dhawale said. “We are organising a prayer meet on January 10 in our village Kanhur Mesai (in Shirur taluka) on the tenth day of Rahul’s death. We invite all of you to come.”</p>\n<p>Dhawale also said that he does not believe the Sambhaji Bhide is behind the violence that broke out in Bhima Koregaon. As of now, he said, there is no clarity about who killed Rahul and whether any right-wing or Dalit organisation was involved. “The guilty should be punished,” he said.</p>\n<p>When asked about whether his family is associated with any organisation, Dhawale said that they only participated in the morchas held by Maratha Kranti Morcha for reservation and over the Kopardi rape case.</p>\n<p>So far, he says, the police have not shared anything with the family about who killed his brother. “They are just saying that investigation is on track and that they would arrest the culprit soon. Even Girish Bapat, guardian minister of Pune district, just enquired and promised of speedy justice. We just came to know that post mortem report says that Rahul was assaulted from behind. He was wearing a T-shirt with Shivaji’s face embossed on it, but he was not associated with any group. Many of the youth in the village wear the T-shirt,” Dhawale said.</p>\n<p>As false news continues to circulate on social media, Dhananjay Jadhav of Maratha Kranti Morcha has said that a post that calls for a bandh on January 10 is fake. “We have not called for any bandh,” he said. “The Maratha Kranti Morcha demands that the government should commit a time frame within which the investigation would be completed so that people who lost properties or lives are compensated. If the government fails to do so, we will decide our next course of action.”</p>\n<p>Abhaysingh Adsul, another member, said, “We want the government to give Rs 25 lakh as compensation to Phatangade’s family. As Rahul was fond of fitness and regularly went to the gym, the government should open a gym in his village.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Pune rural police has arrested 12 persons in connection with the riots in Bhima Koregaon. As of now, the total arrests stand at 27, of which three are juveniles who have been released on bail.</p>\n<p>“Pune rural police has arrested six people for creating riots, three for attempt to murder and three who are juvenile. The juvenile accused have got bail while the remaining nine have been sent to police custody till January 11,” said Pune police’s public relations officer Ramkrushna Patil.</p>\n<p>The police is also finding it difficult to write reports on the property that was damaged as the number plates of many cars are not visible. It is also reportedly organising meetings between Maratha and Dalit groups in the affected villages – Bhima Koregaon, Sanaswadi and Vadhu Budruk.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212249/relatives-maratha-youth-killed-bhima-koregaon-violence-demand-speedy-justice/\">Relatives of Maratha Youth Killed in Bhima Koregaon Violence Demand Speedy Justice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: TeamIndus</p></div>\n<p>Antrix, the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation, has cancelled a contract it had with TeamIndus to launch <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/81636/teamindus-moonshot-xprize-rover/\" title=\"India's first private rover\" target=\"_blank\">India’s first private rover</a> to the Moon’s surface, <em>The Ken</em> <a href=\"https://the-ken.com/teamindus-isro-call-off-glxp/\" title=\"reported\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> on January 9. As a result, TeamIndus will likely not be able to meet the March 31, 2018, deadline specified for the Google Lunar X-Prize (GLXP) and be forced to drop out.</p>\n<p>While none of Antrix, TeamIndus and Hakuto have issued official statements, <em>The Ken</em> stated that it would be “virtually impossible for TeamIndus to secure another contract on any other rocket and launch before the deadline”.</p>\n<p>According to the contract, a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) would ferry two rovers – that of TeamIndus and <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/89808/rovers-eca-hakuto-isro/\" title=\"another by Japan's Team Hakuto\" target=\"_blank\">another by Japan’s Team Hakuto</a> – to an orbit around Earth. Once in orbit, a spacecraft carrying the rovers would break off and approach the lunar surface. After a hopefully landing gracefully, the rovers would exit the casing. To win the GLXP, each rover would then have travel 500 metres away from its landing spot and then beam high resolution images and videos of its surroundings to Earth. The prize carried a total purse of $30 million, and intended to encourage a “new space race” to the Moon.</p>\n<p>The GLXP had extended deadlines in 2010, December 2014, May 2015 and August 2017. However, the prize’s administrators had said in October 2017 that they were not going to do so any further. It remains unclear if they will stick to their word.</p>\n<p>There had been five contenders for the prize at the start of 2017: America’s Moon Express, Israel’s SpaceIL, India’s TeamIndus, Japan’s Team Hakuto and an international collaboration called Synergy Moon. With TeamIndus and Antrix have called off their deal, India’s first private lunar rover will have to wait to be realised. SpaceIL has also been faced with a <a href=\"https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5047017,00.html\" title=\"funding crunch\" target=\"_blank\">funding crunch</a> that could leave it out. Moon Express and Synergy Moon remain on track, planning to launch with with Rocket Lab and Interorbital Systems respectively.</p>\n<p>Although TeamIndus may appear to have failed at winning the GLXP, its primary mission as it were, its participation allowed it to set up shop, explore opportunities for private spaceflight in India and set the stage for others like it to follow in the future. Similarly, the competition induced 15 other teams around the world to start solving a difficult problem, in the process setting them on the path of other, more long-term goals. For example, Moon Express eventually plans to mine rare-earth elements on the satellite. Astrobotic, which fell out of contention before 2017, plans to launch its Peregrine lander on the natural satellite <a href=\"http://spacenews.com/astrobotic-to-launch-first-lunar-lander-on-atlas-5/\" title=\"in late 2019\" target=\"_blank\">in late 2019</a>. The Peregrine is expected to be able to carry 265 kg of payloads and already has 11 deals from six countries.</p>\n<p>A thorn in the contenders’ sides was a limit imposed by the GLXP: that no team could be funded to more than 10% by a governmental agency. This is in stark contrast to the fact that the bulk of modern space innovation has been funded by grants and subsidies from governments – from the ambitious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Experiments_at_Space_Scale\" title=\"QUESS programme\" target=\"_blank\">QUESS programme</a> to SpaceX’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX#Launch_contracts\" title=\"reusable first stages\" target=\"_blank\">reusable first stages</a> for its Falcon 9 rocket. As a result, TeamIndus was forced to raise Rs 450 crore from private investors. As of October 2017, it had raised and spent <a href=\"http://www.bgr.in/news/teamindus-scouts-for-funds-for-its-lunar-mission/\" title=\"Rs 225 crore\" target=\"_blank\">Rs 225 crore</a>. There were also reports last year that the startup was struggling to pay salaries and procure hardware on time for critical tests, leading many to leave it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211997/indias-first-private-lunar-rover-line-antrix-contract-collapses/\">India’s First Private Lunar Rover on the Line After Antrix Contract Collapses</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

But Monday’s<span>start </span>already brought scathing headlines.</p>\n<p>“Night of the blunt stiletto,” the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> said as several British<span> new</span>spapers judged that <span>May </span>had failed to draw a line under her travails of 2017. Some Conservative lawmakers agreed, suggesting the moves were a<span> reshuffle </span>in name only, leaving little changed.</p>\n<p>“Is that it?” Conservative lawmaker Nicholas Soames said on Twitter. “I don’t mean to be rude or to be seen to be disloyal but there needs to be a major improvement to the<span> reshuffle </span>tomorrow.”</p>\n<p><span>May </span>did find some support in the Conservative ranks, with some saying she was setting the ground for more fundamental change after Britain leaves the EU next year.</p>\n<p>By promoting younger, black and women lawmakers to junior roles in government, she hopes to rid the party of its reputation of being “pale, stale and male”.</p>\n<p>But by playing very much to her own party rather than the country, some critics said<span> May </span>risks losing the chance to revitalise what her aides call her “reform agenda”, already hampered by Brexit, a scandal over sexual harassment and struggling public services.</p>\n<p><strong>Accident-prone</strong></p>\n<p>Monday’s<span> reshuffle </span>was blown off course when health secretary Jeremy Hunt convinced<span> May </span>at a lengthy meeting not to move him to a different job.<span> New</span>spapers said he refused to accept a new post, although a source close to<span> May </span>denied that, and said Hunt simply persuaded her.</p>\n<p>Then education minister Justine Greening refused to take a job at the pensions department and quit instead.</p>\n<p>“Social mobility matters to me and our country more than my ministerial career. I’ll continue to do everything I can to create a country that has equality of opportunity for young people,” she tweeted.</p>\n<p>Losing the only lesbian minister in the cabinet threatens what<span> May </span>hoped to be the narrative of her reshuffle: that she was ushering in a<span> new</span>, more diverse team to counter accusations that the Conservative Party is out of touch.</p>\n<p>The resignation of the<span> new</span>ly appointed board member of a<span> new </span>universities watchdog over sexist tweets did little to help distance<span> May </span>from scandals over sexual harassment last year that brought down two ministers.</p>\n<p>More than 200,000 people had signed a petition calling on Toby Young, author of the satirical memoir <em>How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</em>, to be sacked from the Office for Students for a history of derogatory comments about women.

On January 1, five workers in Mumbai were fixing a sewer line which ran 10 metres below ground level. While being lifted back by a crane, the cable broke, which is not surprising at all, and <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/864005/in-mumbai-death-of-four-sanitation-workers-in-a-manhole-puts-illegal-contract-system-under-scrutiny\" title=\"three of them died\" target=\"_blank\">three of them died</a> on the spot. One worker died the next day and the only surviving worker broke his legs and underwent surgery. In another case, <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/07/three-manual-scavengers-die-of-asphyxiation-in-bengaluru-1747011.html\" title=\"three manual scavengers died on January 7 in Bangalore\" target=\"_blank\">three manual scavengers died on January 7 in Bangalore</a> while cleaning a choked manhole at a residential apartment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/activists-govt-differ-on-definition-of-manual-scavengers/articleshow/62343910.cms\" title=\"D.V. Samuel\" target=\"_blank\">D.V. Samuel</a> of the Safai Karmachari Andolan pointed out that the government does not even consider the sanitation workers cleaning septic tanks and sewer lines as manual scavengers. An alarming number of sanitation workers regularly die due to toxic gases from the human waste that they manually clean by going inside septic tanks and sewer lines. If we refuse to even acknowledge manual scavenging, how are we ever going to stop it?</p>\n<p>There is another blind spot in these cases of sewer deaths – the victims’ caste. Most media reports on the deaths in sewer lines and septic tanks do not mention the caste of the workers. However, it is no secret that most of the sanitation workers in our country are from those castes that are regarded as ‘untouchable’ by Hinduism. While our constitution prohibits forcing Dalits to do any demeaning work, many of them still continue to be engaged in sanitation work and manual scavenging. The practice of manual scavenging is banned under the <a href=\"http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/prohibition-of-employment-as-manual-scavengers-and-their-rehabilitation-bill-2012-2449/\" title=\"Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act of 2013\" target=\"_blank\">Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act of 2013</a>. But in cases when the worker involved is a Dalit, the practice of manual scavenging also violates the <a href=\"http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/1989/The%20Scheduled%20Castes%20And%20the%20Scheduled%20Tribes%20%20(Prevention%20of%20Atrocities)%20Act,%201989.pdf\" title=\"Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989\" target=\"_blank\">Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989</a> with its amendments of 2015.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/157637/manual-scavenging-rehabilitation-laws/\" title=\"To End All Forms of Manual Scavenging, Laws Must Be Better Implemented\" target=\"_blank\">To End All Forms of Manual Scavenging, Laws Must Be Better Implemented</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Rarely do sewer deaths lead to these Acts being invoked. After the recent deaths of two manual scavengers while cleaning a sewer line in Thangadh, Surendranagar district in Gujarat, the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/two-sanitation-workers-died-in-thangadh-demand-for-fir-against-cm-vijay-rupani-for-failing-to-stop-manual-scavenging/\" title=\"chief officer of municipality of Thangadh was charged\" target=\"_blank\">chief officer of municipality of Thangadh was charged</a> with violating the 2013 Act prohibiting manual scavenging and the SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. However, this is very uncommon. Most of the cases of sewer deaths get buried or hidden under various non-serious charges. The Mumbai police, for example, is smart enough to avoid pressing proper charges. In the case of the January 1 death, the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/powai-manhole-mishap-1-more-worker-dead-crane-operator-held/articleshow/62344267.cms\" title=\"Mumbai police booked the crane operator\" target=\"_blank\">Mumbai police booked the crane operator</a> under IPC section 304(A) for causing death by negligence and arrested him. Even when three manual scavengers died in a septic tank in Malad East last year, the police used the same section 304(A).</p>\n<p>The Mumbai police is also good at finding the least powerful person to file a case against. In the case of the Malad deaths, the police did not charge the property owners who had hired those workers. Nor did the police mention in its report anything about the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which was responsible for providing sanitation services in that area. The police found the only surviving worker, who could have died himself had he not been away for some chores, responsible for the three deaths. In the case of the January 1 deaths, the police found the crane operator guilty, arrested him immediately and charged him with Section 304(A). But the police has only “managed to trace the contractor“ so far and has not arrested him yet because it is wondering, in the words of <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/864005/in-mumbai-death-of-four-sanitation-workers-in-a-manhole-puts-illegal-contract-system-under-scrutiny\" title=\"deputy commissioner of police Navinchandra Reddy\" target=\"_blank\">deputy commissioner of police Navinchandra Reddy</a>, “whether the contractor can be held liable for these deaths”. The Mumbai police knows one thing very well – the person who has money is never guilty.</p>\n<p>Coming back to the seven deaths in seven days, it is noteworthy that the two incidents happened in Mumbai and Bengaluru, and not in some remote rural or tribal area where sucker machines might not be available. It is, therefore, important to question why these deaths still occur. Why is it that the BMC, the richest municipal corporation in India, does not care for the lives of those who work for it? Why is it that the people of Bangalore, who can come together to stop the construction of a flyover to save some trees, cannot come together to save some human lives? Why are they still sending manual scavengers down manholes? Do these people consider manual scavengers to be disposable – born to serve them and then die for them?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09184732/sewers-11.jpg?fit=1280%2C720\" data-orig-size=\"1280,720\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09184732/sewers-11.jpg?fit=300%2C169\" data-attachment-id=\"212227\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09184732/sewers-11.jpg?resize=1049%2C590&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212220/seven-manual-scavengers-died-seven-days-still-silence/sewers-11/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09184732/sewers-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"sewers-11\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212227\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Why is the government outsourcing a dangerous work to contractors who hire informally and then escape instead of owning responsibility? Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p>We need to think about why a Dalit has to clean sewers or septic tanks by hand when the rest of society is not expected to do any of such work. Who is forcing the Dalits to remain in this filthy and dangerous job, to live a life of humiliation, and then to die in an abyss – a deep and dark one, full of obnoxious smells and poisonous gases? No one cares about their deaths; no one protests when they happen. What is the reason for our society’s collective silence? Why is everyone from the prime minister, the president, chief ministers and Dalit leaders silent?</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/118940/manual-scavenging-in-india-2017/\" title=\"The Life of Labour: Despite Law Prohibiting it, Manual Scavenging Continues to Claim Lives\" target=\"_blank\">The Life of Labour: Despite Law Prohibiting it, Manual Scavenging Continues to Claim Lives</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The systemic silence on the deaths of the Dalit manual scavengers means that our society also wants to let them happen. These are not accidental deaths but institutionalised and political killings. Every year, the government and people in positions of power come together to decide how much money should be put in to save these lives. This year’s Union budget will also be declared soon. The government keeps cutting down the budget without any justification. From a <a href=\"https://www.counterview.net/2017/03/modi-govt-allocates-1-of-upa-budget-to.html\" title=\"budget of Rs 557 crore in 2013-14\" target=\"_blank\">budget of Rs 557 crore in 2013-14</a> for rehabilitating manual scavengers, we have come down to a petty budget of <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/157637/manual-scavenging-rehabilitation-laws/\" title=\"Rs 5 crore in 2017\" target=\"_blank\">Rs 5 crore in 2017</a>. This was not a mistake, but a ‘plan’ for 2017. So when we noticed that sanitation workers were <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/198993/sanitation-workers-deaths-caste-swachh-bharat/\" title=\"dying at the rate of one every other day in 2017\" target=\"_blank\">dying at the rate of one every other day in 2017</a>, it is hard to not blame the government for letting these workers die without any help.</p>\n<p>It is also not a coincidence that the private contractor responsible for the safety of the workers in Malad fled. Why is the government outsourcing dangerous work to contractors who hire informally and then escape instead of owning responsibility? The answer is that it is, like in any other sector, a mutually agreed upon beneficial situation in which both the government and the contractors can get away with the maximum profits and least responsibilities. That is what they have learned from the professors of neoliberalism – to leave it to the market and let the poor perish and rich flourish.</p>\n<p>So is 2018 a very happy new year for the government where they don’t have to spend any money to save these lives? Maybe the government can avoid all its responsibilities by hiring contractors for everything. The Swachh Survekshan 2018 will fail to ensure the safety of manual scavengers again. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will again fail to include them.</p>\n<p>Along with new year wishes to the government, we also have a request – let us declare a day as National Shame Day. On National Shame Day, our ministers, civil society and fellow citizens can take some time out and think about how they are promoting manual scavenging. We hope that they will realise what they do by letting sanitation workers clean their septic tanks and sewer lines manually instead of using suction machines.</p>\n<p><em>Sheeva Dubey is pursuing her PhD from the School of Communication at the University of Miami and Dhamma Darshan Nigam is with the Safai Karmachari Andolan.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212220/seven-manual-scavengers-died-seven-days-still-silence/\">Seven Manual Scavengers Died in Seven Days.

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> The Supreme Court on Monday batted for the freedom of expression of journalists and and said that some instance of “wrong reporting” should not be held on to forever.</p>\n<p>These observations assume significance in light of the Unique Identification Authority of India <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211333/uidai-files-fir-tribune-reporter-aadhaar-breach-story-report/\" title=\"filing an FIR\" target=\"_blank\">filing an FIR</a> against journalist Rachna Khaira and the Chandigarh-based English newspaper <em>The Tribune</em> for exposing flaws in protection of personal data under Aadhaar, as well as the frequent filing of defamation cases by corporations and politicians against media organisations.</p>\n<p>The court refused to revive a defamation case against senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai and Raghav Bahl – founder and former managing director of Network18 – and dismissed an appeal filed by Rahmat Fatima Amanullah – daughter of former Bihar minister Parveen Amanullah – against a Patna high court order. A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud said: “You must allow freedom of expression by journalists. There may be some wrong reporting. But don’t hold on to it forever.”</p>\n<p>The petitioner had challenged a September 2017 judgement by the Patna high court quashing cognisance taken by a magistrate of her defamation complaint. The petitioner had sought defamation proceedings against Sardesai – the editor-in-chief of the IBN network at the time – and Bahl for a 2011 report in which she was accused of being involved in a land allotment scam.</p>\n<p>It was alleged by the petitioner that the television channel, in order to increase its TRP rating, had ran a story without verifying facts.</p>\n<p>When her counsel said the news item was per se defamatory, Chief Justice Misra orally observed: “In a democracy you must learn to tolerate. The case has continued since 2011. The persons have spent a lot of time and money in defending themselves. Defamation may be constitutionally valid. But an alleged incorrect news item about a scam does not amount to defamation.”</p>\n<p>The CJI further observed, “There could be some error or enthusiasm in reporting an alleged scam. But we must allow freedom of speech and expression to press at the fullest. There may be some wrong reporting. For that they need not be hauled up for defamation.”</p>\n<p>Rahmat Fatima had alleged that on July 18, 2011 IBN7 (now News18) aired a story accusing her of being involved in a scam in the allotment of Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority land and made defamatory remarks against the parents of the complainant as well as the complainant.</p>\n<p>The petitioner alleged that the news story in question had been broadcasted without care, caution or honesty – the ethics that every journalist is supposed to uphold. The high court, however, rejected the complaint and the present appeal is directed against this order.</p>\n<p>The petitioner contended that the news item was telecast and shared with the public with the tacit knowledge and approval of the journalists, who did not verify the genuineness of the information. She further said it amounted to candidly suppressing facts and intentionally making false accusations, highlighting a “wholly imaginary, fabricated and distorted” picture regarding the land allotment. The high court had allowed the petition by Sardesai, who had challenged the magistrate’s decision to take cognisance of the defamation complaint filed by her.</p>\n<p>The high court had said: “In this case, the offence of defamation is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of two years. Hence, cognisance for its conspiracy, under Section 120B of IPC, without the consent of the state government or the district magistrate is bad in law as such not sustainable.”</p>\n<p>“Accordingly, this court is of the view that there is no direct allegation of defamation against the petitioners and cognisance for the offence under Section 120B, that is criminal conspiracy to commit defamation, is barred under the specific provisions of sub-Section (2) of Section 196 of the of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212174/supreme-court-freedom-of-expression/\">Supreme Court Upholds Journalists’ Freedom of Expression</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: NASA</p></div>\n<p>Mining asteroids might seem like the stuff of science fiction, but there are companies and a few <a href=\"http://www.spaceresources.public.lu/en.html\" title=\"governments\" target=\"_blank\">governments</a> already working hard to make it real. This should not be surprising: compared with the breathtaking bridges that engineers build on Earth, asteroid-mining is a simple, small-scale operation requiring only modest technological advances. If anything is lacking, it is the imagination to see how plausible it has become. I am afraid only that it might not arrive soon enough to address the urgent resource challenges that the world is facing right now.</p>\n<p>As an academic researcher, I work with <a href=\"http://deepspaceindustries.com/\" title=\"several\" target=\"_blank\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.planetaryresources.com/\" title=\"asteroid\" target=\"_blank\">asteroid</a>–<a href=\"https://www.atenengineering.com/\" title=\"mining\" target=\"_blank\">mining</a> <a href=\"http://www.transastracorp.com/\" title=\"companies\" target=\"_blank\">companies</a> to address that urgency. I depend on their funding, so there are trade secrets I cannot share. However, I can reveal the core reasons why I am optimistic about the business case for asteroid-mining, and what it will mean for our future.</p>\n<p>Many people are skeptical of asteroid-mining because they imagine that the goal is to bring platinum back for sale in Earth’s metals market. Reporters repeatedly cite an irresistible statistic that the platinum in an asteroid can be worth trillions of US dollars, but anyone with an understanding of economics realises that bringing home a huge stash of precious metal would crash the market, reducing the valuation of the asteroid.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the plan is to dole out platinum in small quantities to keep the valuation high (as it is done in the diamond industry), then how could asteroid companies compete with terrestrial mining companies that benefit from a mature, low-cost terrestrial supply chain and transportation network?</p>\n<p>This is exactly why platinum is not the objective of asteroid-mining. Instead, the first product from asteroids will be something much less obviously precious: water.</p>\n<p>To rocket scientists, water is the raw material for propellant. Launching water from Earth into space consumes a lot of propellant, which makes the whole concept self-defeating. Fortunately, water is abundant in space, where it is much easier to move around. <a href=\"http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/things-to-do-with-space-water/\" title=\"Water\" target=\"_blank\">Water</a> can be readily extracted from clay minerals in a common class of small bodies known as carbonaceous asteroids. Once separated from the minerals, the water can then be split by electricity (a process called electrolysis) into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket propellant – the key ingredients of rocket fuel.</p>\n<p>Using rocket propellant produced in space will reduce the cost of doing everything else in space, initiating a virtuous cycle for the off-Earth supply chain and transportation network. Before that can happen, though, we must find the customers who can get the whole process started.</p>\n<p>Who will buy rocket fuel made from asteroid water? One concept is to sell it to telecommunications companies for boosting satellites into orbit. A decade ago, most satellites were launched with a small upper-stage rocket attached. The rocket initially lofts the satellite into geostationary transfer orbit, a highly elliptical orbit having perigee (the low point) just a few hundred kilometres above the Earth’s surface, and apogee (the high point) about 36,000 kilometres higher. The spacecraft coasts to apogee, where the rocket fires and circularises the orbit so that the satellite can begin selling data to customers. The cost of the disposable upper-stage rocket is very high, however.</p>\n<p>Today, most satellite owners place a lightweight electric thruster on the spacecraft instead. Such thrusters are cheaper and more efficient, but very weak. It takes six to 12 months for satellites to reach final orbit. Time is money, so this delay still costs the satellite-owners hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues.</p>\n<p>Asteroid-mining will provide a third option. A mining company will sell water to an in-space transportation company, which will use it to refuel a space tug parked in Earth orbit. The tug will dock with the newly launched satellite in geostationary transfer orbit, and boost it to the final orbit quickly, within a day.</p>\n<p>According to our calculations, the total cost for this service, including capital recovery, finance charges, insurance and profit for all parties, will be less than the lost revenues of the current method, so that means there is a business case. The only concern is whether there are enough early customers to get the service established.</p>\n<p><span>H</span>ere is where the national space agencies like NASA can help. If they develop an in-space refuelling depot to lower their costs for exploring the Moon or Mars, and if they give out commercial contracts for some of this space water, they will lower the capital investment and risk for the new mining companies. In this <a href=\"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29AS.1943-5525.0000236\" title=\"way\" target=\"_blank\">way</a>, government agencies can ensure the earlier success of private space industry. This is a legitimate role for government because taxpayers will greatly benefit.</p>\n<p>An asteroid-mining infrastructure could help to solve a major impending resource problem. Within a decade or two, the current system of satellites and fiber optics will not be able to keep up with the demand for wireless and internet data. I know of no solution apart from building antennas in space that are too large to launch on rockets, because nothing else scales up quickly enough to meet the data needs that will grow exponentially through to the end of the century. Metal from asteroids will not be sold on Earth, where it would be too expensive. It will remain in space, transmitting precious data down into the digital market.</p>\n<p>Similar <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1145675/?reload=true\" title=\"arguments\" target=\"_blank\">arguments</a> can be made that generating solar energy in space will, by sometime this century, be cheaper than generating energy on Earth through any known method. The energy might then be beamed to the ground via microwaves. Moving most of the energy sector into space will unburden the planet of the environmental impacts of energy generation, along with the entire supply chain that supports it. Even wind and solar disrupt large areas of land.</p>\n<p>Off-planet energy generation could eliminate one-quarter of the human industrial footprint by 2100, by some <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964616300625\" title=\"estimates\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a>. This does not even take into account the exponentially growing energy footprint of computer manufacturing and operation, which is terrifying from an environmental perspective.</p>\n<p>Note that none of these ideas involves bringing asteroid materials back for sale on Earth. The real value of space-based mining will be to create a space-based industry that benefits all of us. The primary import from space will be massless photons carrying data and energy.</p>\n<p>The important point our government leaders should understand is that investing in space-mining is a safe bet on our future, one of the safest they can make. NASA and the other space agencies will get more science and exploration, plus greater geopolitical presence, for less cost than their current way of doing business. Saving the Earth and improving our quality of life might simply be side effects we get for free.<img alt=\"Aeon counter – do not remove\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/metrics.aeon.co/count/f004f622-6975-4295-8f38-fb3cc5091cb1.gif?resize=1%2C1&ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published at <a href=\"https://aeon.co\" title=\"Aeon\" target=\"_blank\">Aeon</a> and has been republished under Creative Commons.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212179/start-mining-asteroids-for-faster-data-and-a-cleaner-planet/\">Start Mining Asteroids for Faster Data and a Cleaner Planet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

With Modi as their brother, they have nothing to fear. The might of the BJP government is with the Muslim woman when she is seeking protection against her husband. But not otherwise. Not when she is being attacked by rioting mobs during communal violence, when her house is torched or when she is threatened with gangrape. Not when she is the widow of a man lynched by cow vigilante mobs. Not even if she is a Hindu who wishes to marry a Muslim. Modi will not come to her aid even when she is beaten by her husband or thrown out of her home. But if her husband pronounces instant triple talaq, he will be there for her.</p>\n<p>The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-muslim-women-have-broken-triple-talaq-shackles-1794172\" title=\"has expressed\" target=\"_blank\">has expressed</a> his concern for the plight of the Muslim women who are victims of instant talaq time and again. <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/EbifI3fvFlTAn6KGCPfc6H/In-runup-to-UP-elections-Narendra-Modi-seeks-support-from.html\" title=\"During the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh\" target=\"_blank\">During the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh</a>, he shed tears over the plight of his poor ‘Muslim sisters’ and vowed to bring justice to them.

A draconian law was placed upon the plank of humanity – and the opposition was found floundering. After all, it is not easy to oppose a Bill clothed in the language of humanity. Anyone opposing it would risk being labelled a male chauvinist, unless one had a cogent and convincing argument to counter it. But <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/owaisi-triple-talaq-bill-debate-reminiscent-of-december-6-1992/1/1120469.html\" title=\"objections raised by Asaduddin Owaisi\" target=\"_blank\">objections raised by Asaduddin Owaisi</a> could easily be brushed aside as the rant of a “firebrand Muslim fundamentalist”. A rudderless opposition caved in and despite protests by some members, the Bill was endorsed and the government won the day.</p>\n<p>The Bill could not be countered on the plank of violating the human rights of Muslim men, though when you scratch the surface, that is exactly what the Bill is all about. Demonising Muslim men either as <em>jihadi</em>s (terrorists) or love jihadis, beef eaters or cow baiters, or as being ‘anti-national’, has been an important political plank for the Modi government. Incarcerating Muslim men for pronouncing triple talaq fits in perfectly with this master plan. But the public at large was not convinced. This was pure rhetoric.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/156331/triple-talaq-muslim-lynching-bjp/\" title=\"In Wake of Lynching of Muslim Men, BJP’s Resolve to Empower Muslim Women Rings Hollow\" target=\"_blank\">In Wake of Lynching of Muslim Men, BJP’s Resolve to Empower Muslim Women Rings Hollow</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>What needed to be exposed was the hollow claim that the Bill will protect Muslim women. Public opinion had to be generated, stripping the Bill of its veneer of gender justice. Triple talaq <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/170058/supreme-court-instant-triple-talaq-judgment/\" title=\"had already been struck down\" target=\"_blank\">had already been struck down</a> by a five-judge constitutional bench of the apex court. The judgement had not even hinted that a statute criminalising triple talaq be enacted. Yet the government projected as though there was an urgent need to enact this statue as per the Supreme Court mandate. However, it was not a cakewalk for the government in the Rajya Sabha and the Bill had to be deferred.</p>\n<p>My concern is that after the Supreme Court verdict, uttering the words ‘talaq’ thrice does not dissolve the marriage, but filing criminal charges against the husband for pronouncing these words certainly will. An enraged husband will either pronounce talaq in the approved form over a period of 90 days or simply desert her as Hindu husbands do, leaving her high and dry.</p>\n<p>The terminology of “sustenance allowance” used in the Bill adds insult to injury. We have moved far ahead since when ‘sustenance dole’ was awarded to deserted wives. Today, a married woman is entitled to an equal share in the family resources and has a right to reside in the dwelling house (matrimonial residence) free of violence or even the threat of it.</p>\n<p>The provision granting right over her children is being hailed as a positive move since Muslim personal law denies Muslim women right over their children beyond a certain age. This is a fallacy. During custody battles, the courts are bound by one principle alone – the best interest of the child. Often courts decide that the best interest of the child lies with the mother. A Muslim couple is governed by the <a href=\"http://ncpcr.gov.in/showfile.php?lang=1&level=1&&sublinkid=270&lid=708\" title=\"Guardians and Wards Act of 1890\" target=\"_blank\">Guardians and Wards Act of 1890</a>. In any case, when the marriage is intact, where is the question of deciding custody?</p>\n<p>The words “sustenance allowance” and “child custody” tend to convey that utterance of the words talaq thrice has, in fact, dissolved the marriage, a position which is contrary to the Supreme Court verdict.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ncw.nic.in/acts/TheProtectionofWomenfromDomesticViolenceAct2005.pdf\" title=\"Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act \" target=\"_blank\">Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act </a>was enacted in 2005 to protect the rights of all women and entitles them to claim rights during the subsistence of marriage. This statute is applicable to women across the religious divide. This is a uniform civil law. There is already a well-oiled machinery that is provided under this statute. Though it is not in the best shape, the challenge is to render it more receptive to the needs of women.</p>\n<p>It is ironic that a government which pledges support to the concept of a uniform civil code, instead of strengthening an existing law which secures the rights of Muslim women, is proposing to place them under a special statute meant only for Muslim women in order to gain political mileage. There was no mention of this statute during the Lok Sabha debates.</p>\n<p>What could the reason be – ignorance or design? Rather than protecting the civil rights of Muslim women, incarcerating the husbands appears to be the need of the hour. Hence, not just actual instances of instant triple talaq, but even a mere suspicion of it will suffice. Any busybody can approach the police. The offence is non-bailable and non-compoundable. Soon there will be talaq vigilante squads along the lines of cow vigilantes.</p>\n<p>We are told that this is what Muslim women themselves have asked for. Some Muslim women have welcomed this Bill – Shayara Bano, Ishrat Jahan, Aafreen, Farah Faiz, Zakia Soman, Noor Jehan and members of their group the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA). Of these, <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/triple-talaq-petitioner-ishrat-jahan-joins-bjp/article22342063.ece\" title=\"Jahan has recently joined BJP\" target=\"_blank\">Jahan has recently joined BJP</a>. Faiz, an intervener in the triple talaq case, is the president of RSS-affiliated Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh. <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/big-step-now-enforce-law-strictly-tt-crusader-shayara-bano/articleshow/62299578.cms\" title=\"Bano was recently facilitated by the UP finance minister\" target=\"_blank\">Bano was recently facilitated by the UP finance minister</a> and earlier in Pune by BJP leaders, even while she is fighting a legal battle to get her children’s custody. These have become icons for the ruling party.</p>\n<p>The co-founders of BMMA, Soman and Noorjehan Safia Niaz, <a href=\"https://bmmaindia.com/2015/11/27/letter-to-pm-demanding-codification-of-muslim-family-law/\" title=\"had written a letter\" target=\"_blank\">had written a letter</a> to the prime minister in December 2015 demanding codification of Muslim family law. They had flagged instant triple talaq and polygamy as the most pressing problems facing Muslim women overriding concerns of poverty, illiteracy and marginalisation. Rather than using existing legal provisions to help these women, they had asked for a new law. The argument then was that women are too poor and hence unable to approach the court. How will the same women now use the daunting criminal legal process?</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/210677/rather-vilifying-triple-talaq-bill-lets-look-ways-make-better/\" title=\"Rather Than Vilifying the Triple Talaq Bill, Let’s Look For Ways to Make It Better\" target=\"_blank\">Rather Than Vilifying the Triple Talaq Bill, Let’s Look For Ways to Make It Better</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>There may be a few other Muslim women who are also not convinced that triple talaq has already been declared invalid by the Supreme Court. We saw them on television screens distributing sweets after Lok Sabha passed the Bill.</p>\n<p>They were also shown distributing sweets after the Supreme Court verdict. Then what went wrong? Four months later, we are told that the court verdict has not stopped triple talaq and a criminal law is needed as a deterrent. The logic of a stringent law as deterrent is deeply flawed. It has not worked in cases of dowry murders, rape or child sexual abuse. How will it act as a deterrent in triple talaq cases?</p>\n<p>If after initial arrest, the husbands are out on bail and cases drag on for years, what will the next demand be – instant justice by public flogging? Will this demand be raised on the basis that <a href=\"https://dohanews.co/four-things-to-know-about-flogging-as-a-punishment-in-qatar/\" title=\"some Islamic countries have it\" target=\"_blank\">some Islamic countries have it</a>? And will Modi as the brother and saviour of Muslim women come to their aid and formulate yet another Bill to address this problem on the ground that Muslim women are asking for it?</p>\n<p>The Muslim community, like all communities, is not divided along gender lines – women, the helpless victims of triple talaq and the brutish men who pronounce triple talaq are part of the same composite community which is being increasingly pushed to a corner where survival is at stake. They lack a political voice. Economic development has bypassed them. Marginalised from the mainstream, they live a ghettoised existence. Muslim women campaigners need to remember that Modi is not just the brother of Muslim women, he is the ‘Big Brother’ of all Muslims.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/wfonvo/\" title=\"Flavia Agnes\" target=\"_blank\">Flavia Agnes</a> is a women’s rights lawyer.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212012/muslim-triple-talaq-bill/\">The Triple Talaq Bill and BJP’s Selective Concern for Muslim Women</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

However, the court, after an hour-long hearing of the counsel, representing various stake-holders, made it clear that if they choose to play the national anthem, patrons have to show respect by standing up.</p>\n<p>With today’s ‘modification’ order, the court disposed of the public interest litigation petition, filed by Shyam Narayan Chouksey, which had led to its <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/83471/national-anthem-films-supreme-court/\" title=\"controversial interim order on November 30, 2016\" target=\"_blank\">controversial interim order on November 30, 2016</a>, making it mandatory for cinema owners to play the anthem at the start of every show. The exemptions, granted earlier by the court to persons who cannot stand up because of their specified disabilities, would continue.</p>\n<p>Earlier, the bench took note of the Centre’s affidavit, brought to its notice by the Attorney General KK Venugopal, who suggested that the court could replace the words ‘shall play’ used in the interim order of November 30, 2016, with ‘may play’, leaving it to the discretion of the cinema owners whether to play the anthem or not. Venugopal assured the court that the inter-ministerial committee constituted by the government is likely to make its recommendations within six months on amending the relevant laws and executive orders for the purpose.</p>\n<p>The inter-ministerial committee is headed by additional secretary (border management), Ministry of Home Affairs, with representatives from the ministries of defence, external affairs, culture, women and child development, parliamentary affairs, information and broadcasting, minority affairs, and departments of legal affairs, school education and literacy and empowerment of persons with disability.</p>\n<p>Upon considering the recommendations made by the committee, the Centre assured the court that it might bring out the requisite notification or circular or rules in this regard, if required.  The change in the stand of the Centre, which had earlier favoured the court’s interim order making the playing of anthem mandatory before the start of every show, follows the court’s directive to it to “take a call, without being influenced by its order”. The court had emphasised that the Centre could use its discretion to “regulate in an inclusive manner or as it feels fit”.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09171937/anthem.jpeg?fit=980%2C457\" data-orig-size=\"980,457\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09171937/anthem.jpeg?fit=300%2C140\" data-attachment-id=\"212178\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09171937/anthem.jpeg?resize=980%2C457&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/212158/cinema-owners-can-decide-whether-to-play-national-anthem-but-mandatory-to-stand-if-played-sc/anthem/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09171937/anthem.jpeg?fit=980%2C457\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"anthem\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212178\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, gives various instances of insults to the national flag and the constitution of India, but is silent on insults to national anthem, beyond prevention of its singing, or causing disturbances to an assembly engaged in such singing.

He claimed that the Centre’s executive orders in this regard are not being followed, which justifies the court’s intervention.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/190193/supreme-court-national-anthem-movie-theatres/\" title=\"How the Supreme Court Almost Recalled Its Order on Playing the National Anthem in Theatres\" target=\"_blank\">How the Supreme Court Almost Recalled Its Order on Playing the National Anthem in Theatres</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Senior counsel, CU Singh, representing an intervener, Kadungallur Film Society, Kerala, which had sought the recall of the November 30, 2016 order, however, opposed the petitioner’s contention saying the court is not the right forum for removing this ambiguity, and that he should approach the parliament for the purpose. He suggested that the parliament, in its wisdom, believed that insults to the national anthem have to be determined on a case-to-case basis, and therefore, an exhaustive list of insults, specified in the Act in the case of national flag and the constitution, was not considered appropriate.</p>\n<p>Venugopal too agreed with Singh that disrespect to the national anthem should be considered on a case-to-case basis, but assured the court that the petitioner’s suggestions would be considered by the committee.</p>\n<p>Singh expressed his satisfaction with the change in the Centre’s stand on the issue.</p>\n<p>Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, representing an impleader in the case, submitted that the national anthem has sacred elements. “Let it not be trivialised all the time,” he told the court after observing that its earlier order, aimed to promote respect for anthem, had only led to the rise of “popcorn nationalism”.</p>\n<p>While it is anybody’s guess on what the committee would recommend and what the Centre’s ultimate stand on the recommendations would be, today’s outcome shows that the court wriggled out of the case using the change in the Centre’s stand as an excuse, as it became increasingly clear that the judiciary ought not to have intervened in the matter in the manner it did.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212158/cinema-owners-can-decide-whether-to-play-national-anthem-but-mandatory-to-stand-if-played-sc/\">Cinema Owners Can Decide Whether to Play National Anthem but Mandatory to Stand If Played: SC</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters/Murad Sezer</p></div>\n<p>Nothing catches the eye like gold set against red. And in the great war of the twentieth century, the colour scheme was on both sides of the divide — the Soviet hammer and sickle, McDonald’s golden arches.</p>\n<p>At its peak, some variation of the USSR’s flag flew over 20% of the Earth’s habitable landmass. But while McDonald’s has now spread to over 120 countries, today only three of the four ruling Communist parties left fly the hammer and sickle. Of the five nations that claim Marxism-Leninism, the hammer and sickle appears on the state flags of none. Once the symbol of the struggle for a better world, today the hammer and sickle is a sign of little more than single-party sclerosis.</p>\n<p>Yet that very icon was forged in the kind of populist fires that have eluded it for decades. In 1918, the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/11/bolsheviks-russian-revolution-october-lenin\" title=\"Bolsheviks\" target=\"_blank\">Bolsheviks</a> were looking for a new flag for their young state. They knew that they had to communicate the weight of their achievement — the first workers’ state in history. Just as the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/07/french-revolution-bastille-day-guide-jacobins-terror-bonaparte/\" title=\"French Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">French Revolution</a>’s tricolor set the standard for the republics of the nineteenth century, Soviet iconography, they believed, should set the standard for the coming proletarian states. So <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/dilemmas-vladimir-lenin-tariq-ali-russian-revolution-democracy\" title=\"Lenin\" target=\"_blank\">Lenin</a> and Anatoly Lunacharsky, the commissar of education, held a design contest to take in entries from all across the republic.</p>\n<p>The winning entry borrowed the industrial imagery (the hammer) so celebrated in British, French, and German labor and <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/06/social-democracy-polanyi-great-transformation-welfare-state\" title=\"social-democratic\" target=\"_blank\">social-democratic</a> parties, but made a major concession (the sickle) to the three-quarters of Russians that were still peasant farmers. After all, the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/11/october-revolution-china-mieville-bolsheviks\" title=\"Bolsheviks\" target=\"_blank\">Bolsheviks</a> were European <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/democratic-socialism-judis-new-republic-social-democracy-capitalism\" title=\"social democrats\" target=\"_blank\">social democrats</a>, but their genius lay in their readiness to adapt doctrine to experience — to mold European Marxism to tsarist Russia.</p>\n<p>In other words, in a country that didn’t neatly fit their understanding of the world, they made adjustments to their model.</p>\n<p>Today, one hundred years later, the world has turned. Nowhere do the political tasks today look anything like those the Bolsheviks confronted in 1918. In the West at least, the agrarian question has been answered — by capitalism. The Bolsheviks inherited a Europe convulsed by murderous interimperial war; we live in the most peaceful period in recorded history.</p>\n<p>The trade union movement that undergirded both the social-democratic and Western Communist parties has all but disappeared. Even the hammers have begun to look as antiquated as the sickles. Yet on the socialist left, we have hardly sundered our ties to the Soviet example. Leading academics convene conferences to debate “The Idea of Communism,” or publish books on “the resurgence of the communist idea,” or end their histories of October 1917 with a call to keep trying.</p>\n<p>Lest we forget, most of us live in advanced capitalist societies ruled by sturdy, capacious states. In 1917, the tsarist regime had lost two million men to war; the rest returned to a country less developed than Angola, Bangladesh, or postwar Iraq today. No matter how many freshmen come to your September screening of <cite>October</cite>, today the probability of such a revolution is infinitesimally small. And yet, the sharpest way to pillory a lefty is still to call her a reformist.</p>\n<p>How has it come to this? To observe that communism is obsolete is not to argue that it never traveled well. <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/pcf-french-communists-sfio-algeria-vietnam-ho-chi-minh/\" title=\"France \" target=\"_blank\">France </a>and <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/03/italian-communism-remembered/\" title=\"Italy \" target=\"_blank\">Italy </a>both had <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/palmiro-togliatti-italian-communist-party-stalin-fascism-mussolini/\" title=\"thriving\" target=\"_blank\">thriving</a>, powerful Communist Parties with working-class social bases up through the 1980s. Membership in the Italian party peaked at over two million in 1947; it received its highest share of the vote (34.4 percent) in 1976. To Europeans who lived through the nightmares of fascism, the hammer and sickle stood for organized and effective resistance. And soon after the war, after their capitalist classes were discredited for either explicit or tacit support of <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/trump-clinton-fascism-authoritarian-democracy/\" title=\"fascism\" target=\"_blank\">fascism</a>, those hammers and sickles were hoisted by mass workers’ parties who spent the following decades winning sweeping reforms. In their struggles against employers, those trade unionists saw the same noble cause of antifascism.</p>\n<p>Examples abound elsewhere, too. In<a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/south-africa-trade-unions-saftu-numsa-anc-zuma\" title=\" South Africa\" target=\"_blank\"> South Africa</a>, the hammer and sickle flew at the head of a decades-long fight against another reactionary, racist power. In <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/lulism-lula-rousseff-impeachment-petrobras-cunha-corruption-brazil/\" title=\"Brazil\" target=\"_blank\">Brazil</a>, the Communist Party is the oldest active political party, and built its legitimacy in the struggle against a regime that took power after the US-backed 1964 coup d’etat. In parts of <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/05/the-many-faces-of-the-indian-left/\" title=\"India\" target=\"_blank\">India</a>, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) weakened a venal landed elite and won much-prized gains for workers and peasants.</p>\n<p>But today, the Italian Communist Party is <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/06/italy-communist-party-tsipras-list-spinelli/\" title=\"no more\" target=\"_blank\">no more</a>. One wing has become the Tony Blair-inspired Democratic Party; the other the Communist Refoundation Party, which can boast of no more than 17,000 members. In France, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/when-the-workers-were-communists/\" title=\"the Communist Party\" target=\"_blank\">the Communist Party</a> (now at 130,000 members) was a mere junior partner in the coalition behind Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who achieved the highest voting share for a radical left candidate in France since 1969, but did so under his own banner — <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/the-meaning-of-france-insoumise\" title=\"La France Insoumise\" target=\"_blank\">La France Insoumise</a>, a populist left formation that had little use for Soviet iconography. By that point, the French Communists themselves had already removed the hammer and sickle from membership cards.</p>\n<p>In South Africa, the South African Communist Party is an appendage of the ruling <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/05/twenty-years-of-defeat/\" title=\"African National Congress\" target=\"_blank\">African National Congress</a> — a coalition which has done little to transform the realities that today make South Africa the planet’s most unequal nation. The Brazilian Communist Party is impotent — in the lower house of the National Congress, it has only 11 of 513 seats. In India, the CPI-M is today not much more than a regional patronage machine.</p>\n<p>In effect, only two kinds of Communist Parties are left standing: Parties of Atrophy — who can boast large memberships but which have little to offer their supporters — and Parties of Marginality — who have entirely lost any substantial connection to workers, if they ever had one. In some ways, they mirror the two tendencies of the prewar US Communist Party. On the one hand, there was the extreme sectarianism of the Third Period (the late 1920s to early 1930s), in which the Comintern took aim against socialist parties. On the other, the worst accommodationism of the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/10/popular-front-communist-party-democrats\" title=\"Popular Front\" target=\"_blank\">Popular Front</a> and war years, in which the party supported no-strike pledges, uncritically hailed Roosevelt’s New Deal, and even briefly dissolved itself in 1944. <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/06/radicals-in-america-brick-phelps-cpusa-race-class-left-vietnam\" title=\"CPUSA \" target=\"_blank\">CPUSA </a>went so far as to denounce <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/philip-randolph-army-segregation/\" title=\"A. Philip Randolph\" target=\"_blank\">A. Philip Randolph</a> for threatening the first March on Washington in 1941 in an attempt to desegregate war industries — quite a reversal for a party that had demanded “self-determination for the Black Belt” just a few years earlier. But these two extremes — ultra-left marginalism or defanged accommodation — only underline Communism’s deep malaise.</p>\n<p>In fact, the problem goes far beyond parties that never broke with Moscow — it’s anyone who insists on looking at the world through October’s eyes. Counterfactuals have become the stuff of lifelong sectarian debates for the socialist left: “if only Germany had gone the right way, if only Lenin had lived, if only Stalin had been isolated, if only, if only . . .” In almost every instance of mass revolt they find the Bolshevik’s <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/11/october-revolution-china-mieville-bolsheviks\" title=\"October \" target=\"_blank\">October </a>— Germany in 1918–20, France in 1968, Egypt in 2011, and everything in between — revolutions made mere “revolutionary rehearsals” by conniving bureaucrats or naive cadre.</p>\n<p>Instead of seeing the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/11/the-russian-revolution-at-100\" title=\"Russian Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Russian Revolution</a> as a tragic story of impossible choices in the worst possible conditions, we fantasize about a time in which states could be sundered and built from the ground up by revolutionary will. A time in which small groups of disciplined activists and intellectuals could remake the world: “Next time, we’ll be ready — we’ll make sure we make <em>the right decisions!”</em></p>\n<p>Whether or not twentieth-century communism was fated to fail, we now live in a new era. The question of socialism in the twentieth century was unavoidably the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/11/russian-revolution-october-bolsheviks-lenin\" title=\"Russian Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Russian Revolution</a>. Today, it is a question which interests professional historians and the far left. The world’s working classes have moved on. And yet the far left today embraces the Soviet obsession like a vampire hunter wields garlic. The problem is that garlic repels far more than just monsters — it makes you stink.</p>\n<p>At its worst, in this crowd, isolation is proof of revolutionary virtue, rather than political calamity. Particularly in a country like ours, the politics of “Yay revolution! Boo reform!” has led to a rhetorical arms race in which the most virtuous, maximalist positions are the most progressive. That these positions are untethered not only from a mass social base but also any plausible political strategy becomes just more proof of their purity: “Try and co-opt <em>this</em>, you Menshevik!” They are symptoms of a Left that looks<em> inwards</em> for validation — one with a battle plan and plenty of generals but no army.</p>\n<p>Despite what liberals might say, it’s not an inability to atone for communism’s body count which haunts the socialist left today — it’s our inability to move on from these dreams of apocalyptic rupture; fantasies of new, unfathomable worlds that will somehow spring up unencumbered by the shells of the old one.</p>\n<p>The lessons of social democracy’s rightward trajectory have been overlearned to the point of paralysis. As <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/12/anti-communism-soviet-union-united-states-miliband\" title=\"Ralph Miliband\" target=\"_blank\">Ralph Miliband</a> pointed out at the end of his life, Western European Communist Parties were <em>also </em>parties of reform. They differed from social-democratic parties “in terms of their sharper and more radical programmes of reform, and their willingness to resort to extra parliamentary agitation and action.” The uncomfortable truth for both liberals and die-hard revolutionaries is that whenever and wherever Western Communist parties were strongest, it was because they were the most effective <em>reformers</em>, not revolutionaries. They won when they bested the social democrats at their own stated aims. It was not starry-eyed dreaming but everyday material victories that led 1.5 million people to attend Italian Communist Party leader Enrico Berlinguer’s 1984 funeral. The flip side of this fact is that in the pre–World War II period, European Communism was feeble and ineffective — with the telling exception of the French Communist Party during the Popular Front and the Spanish one during the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/george-orwell-spain-barcelona-may-days\" title=\"Civil War\" target=\"_blank\">Civil War</a>.</p>\n<p>The unprecedented success of <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/bernie-sanders-black-voters-adolph-reed-trump-hillary\" title=\"Bernie Sanders\" target=\"_blank\">Bernie Sanders</a>’s run and his enduring popularity should have been a wake-up call to much of Leftworld: the country is ready for working-class politics, and even for the s-word, as long as we talk about it in everyday, tangible terms.</p>\n<p>And yet, much of the radical left learned the opposite lesson from 2016. We have been staking out increasingly wilder terrain, moving the goalposts well beyond what most of the last century’s socialists or communists thought possible. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with horizons — we need them. But the basic challenge of left-wing politics is to train our eyes on horizons that others can see. Social democracy failed not because it traded utopianism for reform but because it swore off horizons entirely, and began to<br>\nlook inwards, upon its own parties and parliaments. In rhetoric, the radical left is different; but in practice, the mistake is similar: victory is defined as whatever makes the already-initiated tick. Ultra-leftism and reformism are united by their scorn for mass action.</p>\n<p>If we are to learn something from October, let it not be from a reading group on Kronstadt. As Luk<em>á</em>cs said, Lenin’s genius was to demand “the concrete analysis of the concrete situation.” Today, the relevant Lenin is not <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/07/the-lies-we-tell-about-lenin\" title=\"Lenin \" target=\"_blank\">Lenin </a>the indefatigable revolutionary, but <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/the-real-vladimir-lenin\" title=\"Lenin \" target=\"_blank\">Lenin </a>the disconsolate strategist — the man who in 1920 chastised Communists “to <em>convince</em> the backward elements, to work <em>among</em>them, and not to <em>fence themselves off </em>from them with artificial and childishly ‘Left’ slogans.”</p>\n<p>One has to ask what such a man would think of socialists’ century-long obsession over the revolution he helped make. Four years before storming the Winter Palace, Lenin was grieving over the sad state of affairs in Russia. And he chose a peculiar example to highlight his own country’s backwardness — the New York Public Library. In it, Lenin saw a tangible, achievable example of what a modern, democratic society could deliver — not a hazy promise of a better world on the other side of disaster.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]hey see to it that even <em>children</em> can make use of the rich collections; that readers can read publicly owned books at home; they regard as the pride and glory of a public library, not the number of rarities it contains, the number of sixteenth-century editions or tenth-century manuscripts, but <em>the extent</em> to which books are distributed <em>among the people</em>, the number of new readers enrolled, the speed with which the demand for any book is met, the number of books issued to be read at home, the number of children attracted to reading and to the use of the library. . . .</p>\n<p>Such is the way things are done in New York. And in Russia?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today, it’s time for us to stop worrying about old answers to old questions and start worrying about the ones working people are asking. For the Bolsheviks, that meant “Peace, Land, and Bread!” For us, the answers will be different. “<a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/medicare-for-all-single-payer-nurses-union-obamacare\" title=\"Medicare for All!\" target=\"_blank\">Medicare for All!</a>” is a good start. So is “Green Jobs for All!” Each of these strikes at the core of the socialist dream — a radically more equal distribution of work, wealth, and leisure. These are horizons everyone can see — and most desperately want to reach.</p>\n<p>But whatever the answers are, finding them is the only hope we have of winning. A radical must plant one foot firmly in the world as it is and the other in the world as she knows it could one day be. With the rise of <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/what-did-bernie-do\" title=\"Sanders \" target=\"_blank\">Sanders </a>and <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/06/jeremy-corbyn-election-results-labour-theresa-may-left\" title=\"Corbyn\" target=\"_blank\">Corbyn</a>, it’s clear that even in the heart of global capital, tens of millions of people are dead set on changing the world.</p>\n<p>Everyone can see it. Everyone can feel it. Everyone, that is, who’s not looking for October.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on Jacobin.

Credit: Priya Ranjan Sahu</p></div>\n<p>Noted environmentalist and water activist Ranjan Panda was among the first few in Odisha, as well as in Chhattisgarh, to raise the issue of the ecological and environmental degradation of the Mahanadi and to predict an impending water conflict between both states back in 2006. Convenor of Water Initiatives Odisha, a research body focusing on the water resources of Odisha, Panda made several trips to the Mahanadi basin across Chhattisgarh and Odisha to understand the real impact of water scarcity on the people living along the basin, especially farmers, fisher folk and other indigenous groups, due to indiscriminate industrialisation and contentious dam projects. Panda, known as the ‘waterman of Odisha’, says that coal-fired power plants are the real trigger of the conflict between the two states. What the Mahanadi needs is much beyond a tribunal, he says.</p>\n<p>Excerpts from the interview:</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the root cause of the ongoing battle between Odisha and Chhattisgarh over the Mahanadi waters?</strong></p>\n<p>It is the Hirakud Dam, Asia’s longest earthen dam, to be specific. Our water planners have been resorting to dam building to control rivers for years and if you look into most of the conflicts over inter-state rivers, and even trans-boundary river basins, dams have fuelled the conflicts in the majority of the cases. See the examples of the Narmada (Sardar Sarovar), Tehri, Farakka, Mullapperiyar, Parambikulam Aliyar, Almatti, Baglihar and many others. Even the <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Protest-against-Polavaram-project-affects-normal-life-in-south-Odisha/article15421715.ece\" title=\"Polavaram conflict\" target=\"_blank\">Polavaram conflict</a> that Odisha is fighting with Andhra Pradesh is due to the construction of a large dam project.</p>\n<p>Dams control and hence kill rivers, and thus give rise to conflicts. They fuel conflicts with regard to displacement and other issues while being built, and then more conflicts as long as they stay in the river, colonising the river water for a few and thus depriving many more from their share of water.</p>\n<p>When the Hirakud Dam was built in the 1950s, it was considered as a “modern temple”. But it only benefited a portion of Odisha. Chhattisgarh (then a part of undivided Madhya Pradesh) has possession of almost 90% of the dam’s catchment area but no rights over the Hirakud waters. That is the reason why there was always a dissatisfaction and resentment brewing among the people and leaders there against Odisha. A former finance minister of Madhya Pradesh had categorically told me this. Many people and politicians from Chhattisgarh, with whom I have been interacting, confirm this.</p>\n<p><strong>If around 90% of the catchment area belonged to Madhya Pradesh (and now Chhatisgarh), how was it maintained?</strong></p>\n<p>There was no agreement between Odisha and Madhya Pradesh (or Chhattisgarh) to protect and manage the catchment areas jointly. There is no law in this regard in the country. However, the state governments – with help of the central government – should have done something.</p>\n<p>In the absence of any common plan and cooperation, the upper riparian state took the liberty to treat the catchment area at will. Now that things have come to a pass where the so-called development upstream is starting to hurt Odisha, the state government is resisting. Chhattisgarh’s dams are now the bone of contention. Dams are the real problems and both the states are responsible for this conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>You have been warning the governments for more than a decade, as we can see from your activities and statements. What have you been apprehending and what have you said?</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2006, the Odisha government went on a MoU signing spree with coal-fired power plants and other industries. That is the reason we started to look into the impact of these power plants on the Mahanadi. Coal-fired power plants are heavy water guzzlers. Our search led us to information on similar moves by the Chhattisgarh government. The way both the governments started committing water to these plants and other industries, we realised that the Mahanadi was going to be dried up completely to meet their needs. Mahanadi is cursed by coal. A major portion of its catchment – both in Odisha and Chhattisgarh – bears coal. Mining activities were already killing the river in several ways, so addition of the power plants would be disastrous. So, we started raising our voice and warned the governments about consequences unless they stopped this madness.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122436/Hirakud-dam.jpg?fit=3000%2C1986\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1986\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122436/Hirakud-dam.jpg?fit=300%2C199\" data-attachment-id=\"212029\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;RANJAN PANDA&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1381681587&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;RANJAN PANDA&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122436/Hirakud-dam.jpg?resize=1000%2C662&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211822/odisha-chhattisgarh-mahanadi-dispute/hirakud-dam/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122436/Hirakud-dam.jpg?fit=1024%2C678\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Hirakud-dam\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212029\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Hirakud Dam in Sambalpur district of Odisha. Credit: Priya Ranjan Sahu</p></div>\n<p><strong>How is coal cursing the Mahanadi, can you please give us a few examples?</strong></p>\n<p>The Mahanadi houses a huge coal deposit. While Chhattisgarh has 16% of total coal deposits of the country, Odisha has over 24%. Unfortunately, the maximum of this lies in the Mahanadi basin. Coal mining has not only eroded the basin’s forests and top soil, thereby inflicting a lot of ecological destruction, but also has polluted the river heavily.</p>\n<p>The real culprits are the coal-fired power plants. While the Chhattisgarh government has signed MoUs for about 1,40,000 megawatts (mw) of such types of plants, the Odisha government is planning to generate about 58,000 mw power by burning coal. Most of these plants have been committed water from the Mahanadi and its tributaries. If all these water guzzlers start operating at the same time, the Mahanadi will be completely dry.</p>\n<p>An analysis done by the New Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment on around 25 coal fired power plants in the Mahanadi basin having an installed capacity of a total 20,763 mw has found out that the total water consumed by these from Mahanadi is about 1.59 million cubic metre per day or about 0.51 billion cubic metre per year. That is almost 40% of daily domestic water requirement of the entire population dependent on the Mahanadi.</p>\n<p>We at WIO had done a calculation of water requirement by Odisha’s ambitious 58,000 mw power plan and found that these will require 2,297 million cubic metre of water, which is equivalent to the daily domestic water requirement of six states the size of Odisha. The Mahanadi cannot sustain the coal plants and conflicts will grow further.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be impact of such plants on the environment?</strong></p>\n<p>Coal-fired power plants are not only water guzzlers but also the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. They pollute local lands, crop fields and water bodies to a dangerous extent. Coal fly ash has carcinogenic heavy metals and has been a matter of worry for the Mahanadi and Hirakud reservoir. Power plants have been openly violating environmental laws to release fly ash into the Mahanadi river time and again. Ironically, both the Chhattisgarh and Odisha governments have been siding with polluting coal plants and there is hardly any punishment for these power plants despite their continuous pollution of the lifeline river of both the states. The Ib Valley in Odisha is a “critically polluted area”, according to the Central Pollution Control Board norms, but that has not stopped the government from allowing so many power plants in one cluster, putting the people and the environment at severe risk.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122439/Controversial-NTPC-Lara-Power-Plant.jpg?fit=3000%2C1986\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1986\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122439/Controversial-NTPC-Lara-Power-Plant.jpg?fit=300%2C199\" data-attachment-id=\"212030\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;RANJAN PANDA&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1494787090&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;RANJAN PANDA&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122439/Controversial-NTPC-Lara-Power-Plant.jpg?resize=1001%2C662&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211822/odisha-chhattisgarh-mahanadi-dispute/controversial-ntpc-lara-power-plant/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122439/Controversial-NTPC-Lara-Power-Plant.jpg?fit=1024%2C678\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Controversial-NTPC-Lara-Power-Plant\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212030\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">NTPC’s mega power plant at Chhattisgarh’s Lara, bordering Odisha’s Jharsuguda district. Credit: Priya Ranjan Sahu</p></div>\n<p><strong>If coal-fired power plants are the main culprits, why is Odisha fighting with Chhattisgarh over dams and barrages?</strong></p>\n<p>Chhattisgarh had built 179 dams and barrages on Mahanadi and its tributaries earlier. All these put together have already been obstructing/using about 13,500 MCM of water annually. The current conflict is surrounded around some new dams and barrages that have been built over the last one and a half decades.</p>\n<p>There are about nine barrages which are being built by Chhattisgarh in recent times. All of these together would be obstructing/using around 1,027 MCM water annually. These dams and barrages that Chhattisgarh is building under the guise of irrigation to farmers are actually meant to provide water to coal-fired power plants and other industries. Our calculation says that at least 48 power plants have already been promised water from these barrages in Chhattisgarh.</p>\n<p>While the total power generation capacity of these plants could not be assessed, data available for 11 thermal power plants put the total power generation capacity at 17,075 mw. Then there is one steel plant of 3.2 million tonne per annum capacity. Only these 11 coal plants thus would be drawing 680 MCM of water annually from these barrages. Imagine if all the 48 plants are given permission to draw water, what will be the fate of the river?</p>\n<p>Odisha is thus rightly fighting the barrages built by Chhattisgarh. In fact, Chhattisgarh did not hold any discussion with Odisha while building these barrages. The Central Water Commission has also not done its job properly and has allowed the upstream state to continue with some serious illegalities.</p>\n<p>At Hirakud dam, the biggest irrigation project for Odisha, the water flow requirement during the monsoon period and non-monsoon period is 27,796 MCM and 17,800 MCM respectively for the dam to be able to meet all its commitments, including discharge of minimum environmental flow. Statistics provided by the Odisha government points at a constant downward trend of non-monsoon water availability in the Hirakud reservoir. From 1990-91 until recently, the water availability has reduced from 8,000 MCM to a little over 5,000 MCM. That’s scary and means the dam is already dead. All the barrages, which the Chhattisgarh government claims are ‘non storage facilities’, will be used as reservoirs during non-monsoon period and power plants will suck water using deep bore intake wells from the Mahanadi.</p>\n<p><strong>You have been maintaining that Odisha is not treating Mahanadi any better and the fight is not for farmers but industries?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, that is true. While Odisha is blaming Chhattisgarh for obstruction of water for dams and barrages and for the industrial allocation of water, it has also been treating the Mahanadi as a commodity and not a natural resource. Odisha’s aggressive agitation against Chhattisgarh is more for providing water to industries than to the farmers. Odisha has not only invited many coal plants and other industries to the Mahanadi by selling the ‘surplus water’ theory – which it considers a myth now – but has also been diverting water from the Mahanadi, especially from Hirakud, from farmers’ share to industries. In the early 1990s, the Odisha government made a change in its water allocation plan in a secretive manner, without consulting farmer organisations or anyone else, to prioritise water allocation for industries. The water from the Hirakud dam that was not able to meet the total irrigation target even after 40 years of completion was given away to industries. The farmers started to feel the impact of this by the mid-2000s and started agitating.</p>\n<p>In October 2006, 30,000 farmers formed a human chain covering the Hirakud dam from one end to another, demanding that the Odisha government scrap its plan of giving away 478 cusec water to industries, which had already started to shrink irrigation coverage. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik then assured that not a single drop of water meant for farmers would be diverted to industries. However, while irrigation from Hirakud has shrunk further, the allocation to industries has gone up to 630 cusecs even though industries have been defaulting on payment of their water taxes to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees for decades.</p>\n<p>The story goes beyond the Hirakud dam. For all practical purposes, the Mahanadi has been handed over to industries. The government has allocated water from the river to 128 industries, that stands at 61% of total water allocated to industries from all rivers of the state. The Mahanadi has been completely sold out to industries by both Chhattisgarh and Odisha governments.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122652/Stressed-Mahanadi-at-Sambalpur.jpg?fit=1200%2C795\" data-orig-size=\"1200,795\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122652/Stressed-Mahanadi-at-Sambalpur.jpg?fit=300%2C199\" data-attachment-id=\"212031\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;RANJAN PANDA&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1367135010&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;RANJAN PANDA&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;55&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122652/Stressed-Mahanadi-at-Sambalpur.jpg?resize=997%2C661&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211822/odisha-chhattisgarh-mahanadi-dispute/stressed-mahanadi-at-sambalpur/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09122652/Stressed-Mahanadi-at-Sambalpur.jpg?fit=1024%2C678\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Stressed-Mahanadi-at-Sambalpur\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-212031\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mahanadi river downstream Hirakud dam at Sambalpur. Credit: Priya Ranjan Sahu</p></div>\n<p><strong>What do you think both governments should be doing?</strong></p>\n<p>The governments must immediately understand that the Mahanadi belongs to the farmers, fisher folk, forest dwellers and all the 40 million odd people living in the basin. It also belongs to the ecology it supports and in return gets support from. Mad rush for coal plants and industrialisation is killing the river that is already severely impacted by climate change. The water yield of the basin has reduced by more than 10% due to monsoon shortfall over the last three decades, a recent scientific study has found. That is the highest among all rivers of India that were considered to be ‘water surplus’ basins. A majority of the farmers of the basin depend on rain and the basin has faced consecutive drought for three years. These are real alarm bells that the governments must wake up to. The governments need to work together and make a cumulative ecological assessment of all the mines, industries, thermal power plants and urbanisation projects and if needed, some of the projects should be scrapped. India is already trying to phase out coal in line with its climate action commitments. These states should work in a basin-wise approach of cooperation and decide to phase out coal completely by 2050, and decide to build no new plants from now on. We are asking them for a ‘Peace and Cooperation Charter’, which is possible with mutual dialogue and not conflict which they seem to be getting entangled in around the fight for the remaining reduced flow of the river without looking into rejuvenation of the river.</p>\n<p><strong>Odisha is demanding formation of a tribunal. Do you think the tribunal will solve the matter?</strong></p>\n<p>Going by the existing legal provisions – the <a href=\"http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/1956/A1956-33.pdf\" title=\"Inter State River Water Disputes Act of 1956\" target=\"_blank\">Inter State River Water Disputes Act of 1956</a> – what Odisha is doing is right. I am rather surprised that the central government, which first blamed Odisha of being complacent, is now being complacent itself. Under the current law, the central government should have already constituted a tribunal for the Mahanadi, but it has not kept its promise made both in parliament and at the Supreme Court. That goes beyond the principles of cooperative federalism. A tribunal formation now becomes imminent and the Centre must do it without further delay.</p>\n<p>Having said that, I would also like to point out that tribunals have not proven to be effective in dealing with inter-state river water disputes, nor have they been able to deal with real issues of reviving a river, giving rights to farmers, fisher folks and other indigenous communities. What they would do at the most is to work out a formula of water sharing out of the existing water. But there is no guarantee that their formula will be adhered to by the states in conflict and that no further conflicts will erupt.</p>\n<p>Look at the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/65841/cauvery-water-dispute-violence-hit-bengaluru-limping-back-normalcy/\" title=\"Cauvery conflict\" target=\"_blank\">Cauvery conflict</a> as an example. The conflict over the Cauvery river dates back to more than a century. In 1892, an agreement was reached between the princely state of Mysore and Madras Presidency (now Karnataka) in which Mysore was asked not to build any irrigation reservoir without prior consent of Madras. This agreement failed and a new one was reached in 1924. But the conflict never got solved and the Tamil Nadu government asked for the formation of the tribunal in 1974, even before the 50-year term of the second agreement was over. However, persuasion by the then prime minister and political negotiations made Tamil Nadu withdraw the demand. This led to fresh negotiations and a new formula of water sharing was worked out, which continued for 15 years, but then a tribunal had to be formed in 1990 as conflicts continued. The tribunal gave an interim order on June 25, 1991, asking Karnataka to release 205 thousand million cubic feet of Cauvery water annually to Tamil Nadu (including six thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) to Puducherry). Karnataka objected and this delayed the implementation of the order. After seeing lot of submissions, affidavits, arguments, counter arguments, political battles, negotiations and agitations, the final order was passed in 2007, almost after 17 years, allocating 419 tmc ft water to Tamil Nadu and 270 tmc ft to Karnataka. Kerala and Puducherry were given 30 tmc ft and seven tmc ft respectively.</p>\n<p>It did not end there, as petitions and counter petitions were filed in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has been intervening in this case but the conflict, with many violent protests, has been growing by the year. We have all seen how in September 2016, pro-Kannada people <a href=\"http://www.news18.com/news/india/cauvery-dispute-40-buses-set-on-fire-in-bengaluru-section-144-imposed-1291788.html\" title=\"set fire to vehicles\" target=\"_blank\">set fire to vehicles</a> and attacked government offices in Bengaluru, protesting against the latest order of the Supreme Court. Petitions and review petitions were then filed  and despite the intervention of the Supreme Court, the conflict is not ending.</p>\n<p>The root cause of the fight is therefore scarcity by design of development and the Mahanadi is already a stressed river. What Mahanadi needs is much beyond a tribunal. It needs both the states to immediately start dialogue and common action to save the river from dying further. A lot needs to be done to protect the catchment of the Hirakud reservoir as well as restore the basin ecology, which is now severely degraded owing to mining, industrialisation and urbanisation. We seriously need to rejuvenate our rivers and plan development in an eco-sensitive manner. Or else, we will end up having more conflicts by the year. I sincerely hope both Odisha and Chhattisgarh realise this. Both have to decide to shun large dams and coal forever.</p>\n<p><em>Priya Ranjan Sahu is a senior journalist based in Bhubaneswar.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211822/odisha-chhattisgarh-mahanadi-dispute/\">Interview: Odisha and Chhattisgarh Treating Mahanadi Like a Commodity, Not a Natural Resource</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Similarly, IOC has separately taken 50% stake in an LNG terminal project in Gujarat called GSPC LNG, which is a joint venture between the Adanis and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation(GSPC).</p>\n<p><em>The Wire</em> article raises a simple and commonsensical question: why should public sector undertakings use taxpayer money to pick up a 49% stake when it could have full management control by picking up a 51% controlling interest in the venture?</p>\n<p>Investing upto 49% in the equity and letting the private player control the project does raise questions as to what the government or the PSU is particularly gaining out of it.</p>\n<p>A former chairman of IOC, who wished not to reveal his identity, provided <em>The Wire</em> with his expert view that IOC does not gain any strategic advantage by investing 49% of the share capital without any management control in the Adani venture. We feel his views carry weight as he has helmed IOC and understands its interests as much as the present management.</p>\n<p>Therefore, how can expressing an opinion on the merit or demerit of an investment be deemed defamatory by the Adanis, who are private sector partners with full control of the project? In any case, it is really for the government of India or the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, which owns the oil PSUs, to answer the questions in regard to the merit of such investments. Therefore, it is odd that the Adanis should file a defamation case against <em>The Wire</em>.</p>\n<p>Also, public-private partnership projects, especially in the infrastructure sectors, are routinely discussed and debated in the media because of their complex nature, and government auditors, including the constitutional body CAG, regularly and mandatorily examine these projects. In recent years, public-private partnership projects in roads, airport, oil exploration and infrastructure have been the subject of robust media commentary and debate.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we believe the civil defamation suit from the Adanis over some questions raised in regard to the investments by oil PSUs appears to be an attempt to discourage discussion and debate on the subject as a whole. Interestingly, such attempts to muzzle the media come at a time when a large number of big corporate groups are heavily debt ridden and are not being able to borrow fresh money from banks. Cash-rich PSUs, especially in the oil sector, seem to be substituting for the lack of private sector investments, and in many cases such investments are happening in partnership with the private sector. But the question we are raising is on what kind of terms is this happening? This is a legitimate question and to describe it as defamatory has all the characteristics of what has come to be known as SLAPP.</p>\n<p>Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation or SLAPPs are being used more frequently than ever as a tool to intimidate the media and to prevent inconvenient questions from being raised about the nexus between the government and big business. It is indeed puzzling that defamation suits are being initiated by corporate groups when the media is actually seeking explanations from the government over the merit or otherwise of taxpayers’ money being invested in public-private partnership projects.</p>\n<p>The media has every right to seek explanations from the government and corporate houses where public interest is involved. Sometimes corporates tend to focus on minor errors in reporting which may not be central to the real issue brought forth by the media.</p>\n<p>In this context, the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/media-must-fully-enjoy-freedom-of-speech-and-expression-sc/articleshow/62421964.cms\" title=\"Supreme Court's observations\" target=\"_blank\">Supreme Court’s observations</a> yesterday in a defamation case are very relevant.

Credit: File photo</p></div>\n<p><em>The government’s decision to introduce electoral bonds as a means of funding for political parties has come under severe criticism from many quarters.</em></p>\n<p><em>On January 7, 2018, finance minister Arun Jaitley wrote a Facebook post defending the move. The scheme was first announced in his budget speech in 2017, but the “broad details” were only finalised last week.</em></p>\n<p><em>In reply, CPI(M) general secretary has written a letter to the finance minister, highlighting his party’s position while suggesting the stringent reforms required to make a “clean-up of political funding possible”.</em></p>\n<p><strong>§</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Shri Arun Jaitley<em>ji</em>,</p>\n<p>I am writing as you have asked for suggestions on ‘reforms’ on electoral funding.</p>\n<p>The CPI(M) has constantly and consistently maintained the need for clean electoral funding, and has been deeply concerned over the years as the system has become more skewed towards those with more money. Contesting elections has now become akin to a business enterprise, possible only for the wealthy. This, needs stringent reform.</p>\n<p>At the outset, a good move would be to ban corporate funds from being made available to political parties. We believe that corporates, and especially big corporates, see funding of political parties as an investment, an effective and easy way of being able to push policy in directions that suit them.</p>\n<p>Political parties too, on being recipient of corporate funding, use stints in government to make policies that suit ‘friendly’ corporates. These corporates constitute the ‘supply side’ of corruption which is corroding our system. Unless corporate funding is banned, this problem cannot be solved. The government in 1985, reversed a ban on corporate funding of political parties which had been in place since 1968, but that did not cure the problem of corporate or black money funding political parties; it made the problem worse.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no limit on amounts spent by political parties for election campaigns while there is a limit on the amount that candidates can spend. This, as you know, makes a mockery of the very idea of having a limit on campaign spending. We urge you to bring the expenditures of political parties within a legal limit, violation of which would be subject to stringent punishment.</p>\n<p>Corporates, like all powerful sections of Indian society, must be asked to do their bit towards strengthening Indian democracy and we think this should take the form of them being asked to give a part of their profits towards a state fund set aside for electoral funding.</p>\n<p>No ‘clean-up’ of political funding is possible minus state funding, at least in substantial part, of elections. This has also been recommended by the Dinesh Goswami Committee and the Inderjit Gupta Committee which dwelt on the subject in detail. If like Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), corporates could be asked to donate a part of their earnings to a pool which, in keeping with certain guidelines (like the support individual political parties may have garnered in the previous election, vote-share or the number of seats they have won) it would be a much fairer and transparent way of getting to contribute to the healthy functioning of Indian democracy, than is the case now.</p>\n<p>In Germany, for example, there is state funding of parties, from a corpus which is apportioned on the basis of seats and vote-share of the parties in the Centre and state legislatures in the previous elections. Declared collections by political parties each year, are also matched in certain proportion by money that the state gives to the parties. (This is apart from indirect subsidies like ensuring time on television news proportionately and fairly, across political parties).</p>\n<p>We firmly believe that we need such measures, fine-tuned to our conditions to make the process of funding to political parties more transparent.</p>\n<p>The measures you have introduced recently, I regret to say, have reversed any move towards transparent and clean political funding that may have been possible. Electoral bonds are a deeply regressive move. They make the donor, donee and the amount, each of these three vital aspects, a state secret, literally. This shields donors from the gaze of the electorate which needs to know if policies are being made precisely because it helps certain influential donors.</p>\n<p>By lifting the maximum limit on companies available for political donations, you have raised the prospect of allowing ‘shell’ companies being set up with black money to purely fund political parties. This is a step that is also seriously injurious to the state of our democracy.</p>\n<p>Having amended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), retrospectively, via the Finance Bill, this government has made it possible for foreign funding to flood the coffers of political parties, adding a dangerous dimension to the stability of Indian democracy.</p>\n<p>We are deeply concerned about the measures put in place by this government to render the funding of political parties even more opaque than before. What it does is to provide an ‘Electoral Bonds route’ for dubious funds, to pass, unrecorded and undeclared, shielded from the public eye, to certain political parties.</p>\n<p>Electoral bonds, along with the retrospective amendment to the FCRA (which allows indirect political funding by foreign companies) and the lifting of the maximum limit that corporates can contribute to political parties are the most retrogressive steps taken towards political funding in India and must be rolled back.</p>\n<p>We urge your government to review and immediately reconsider these measures which constitute making political funding a ‘black box’ which has no scope public scrutiny.</p>\n<p>We hope this conversation on electoral funding leads to a deeper debate which your government must push on introducing much needed and more comprehensive electoral reforms. (In opposition, you had supported our proposal of introducing partial proportional representation, but having reaped the fruits of first-past-the-post, your enthusiasm seems to have dissipated).</p>\n<p>I hope that in this new year, the government would be urged to take new steps which would make our democracy healthier, more transparent and enable a genuine level-playing field, where a common citizen can find it as easy to contest elections as a moneyed one.</p>\n<p>With regards,</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>Sitaram Yechury,<br>\nCPI(M) general secretary</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212125/yechury-responds-jaitley-electoral-bonds/\">Yechury Responds to Jaitley, Calls Electoral Bonds a Deeply Regressive Move</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

The stat<span>us </span>was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in El Salvador that left hundreds of tho<span>us</span>ands in the country homeless.</p>\n<p>The decision to end TPS for<span> Salvadorans </span>is part of the administration’s broader p<span>us</span>h to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the US illegally. The move was heavily criticised by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in El Salvador and gave the<span> Salvadorans </span>few options but to leave the US or remain illegally.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected stat<span>us </span>of immigrants in the US whose home countries have been affected by disasters.</p>\n<p><span>Salvadorans </span>are by far the largest group under TPS, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in the US.</p>\n<p>Critics have complained TPS has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in six-month to 18-month increments.</p>\n<p>Patricia Hernandez, 53, arrived in the US in 2000 and applied for TPS after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in North Carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction b<span>us</span>iness with her Honduran h<span>us</span>band. The couple have two US-born teenage sons.</p>\n<p>“This is a real blow for everyone,” said Hernandez by telephone. “Most of<span> us </span>pay taxes, we’re not living off the government, we’re not criminals.”</p>\n<p>The family will move to Honduras with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in Central America.</p>\n<p>Trump administration’s changes to the TPS program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previo<span>us</span>ly had permission to live and work in the US will be subject to deportation if they remain.</p>\n<p>Haitians and Nicaraguans will lose their protected stat<span>us </span>in 2019 and Hondurans, the second largest group in the program, could lose their rights later this year.</p>\n<p>“The past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in the US long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the ‘temporary’ protected stat<span>us </span>a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration,” said Roy Beck, president of Numbers<span>US</span>A, which favours less immigration overall.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09112516/640x640-23.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09112516/640x640-23.jpeg?fit=640%2C426\" data-orig-size=\"640,426\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09112516/640x640-23.jpeg?fit=300%2C200\" data-attachment-id=\"211947\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;REUTERS&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Salvadoran immigrants prepare to exit after a media conference at the New York Immigration Coalition following US President Donald Trump's announcement to end the Temporary Protection Status for Salvadoran immigrants in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., January 8, 2018.

The country has received millions of dollars in aid and rebuilt schools, homes and hospitals, the official said.</p>\n<p>In the past two years, the US has repatriated 39,000<span> Salvadorans</span>, showing the ability of El Salvador to absorb an influx, the official said.</p>\n<p>The government of El Salvador said on Monday that it was glad the administration decided to at least leave the program in place until September 2019.</p>\n<p>“El Salvador’s Foreign Ministry lobbied heavily for the interests of our fellow citizens,” the government said in a statement, adding that it would continue to search for alternatives and seek action by the US Congress to protect the migrants.</p>\n<p>The US Chamber of Commerce had urged the government to extend TPS protections for<span> Salvadorans</span>, Haitians and Hondurans, saying “the loss of employment authorisation for these populations would adversely impact several key ind<span>us</span>tries,” including “construction, food processing, hospitality, and home healthcare services.”</p>\n<p>Congressional Democrats on Monday expressed support for finding a permanent solution to help <span>Salvadorans </span>in the US. But that will be politically difficult at a time when there are rival immigration priorities, including providing permanent protection for “Dreamers” – undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.</p>\n<p>That effort has been weighed down by demands from conservatives in Congress to couple any such move with new efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, especially from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211944/us-tightens-immigration-200000-salvadorans-ousted-2019/\">US Tightens Immigration, Over 200,000 Salvadorans to be Ousted in 2019</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Illustration by Binay Sinha/Business Standard</p></div>\n<p><strong>New Delhi</strong>: Kapil Mohan hardly ever downed a peg. Yet, the dark rum in a fat bottle his company brewed was the favourite evening companion for millions cutting across age, class and continents.</p>\n<p>Mohan, chairman of Mohan Meakin, the maker of Old Monk rum, passed away on Saturday following a cardiac arrest at Mohan Nagar, near Ghaziabad. He was 88. He was the man behind famous brands like Old Monk, Solan No.1, and Golden Eagle, before age and competition caught up.</p>\n<p>The teetotaller, who drew strength primarily from other spirits – of the holy kind – ran the company under his watch for over four decades. Only a year ago, he passed on the executive control to his nephews Hemant and Vinay, though he continued to be the chairman.</p>\n<p>Pushed to the helm, following the death of his elder brother V.R. Mohan in the early 1970s, Kapil saw the emergence of the dark rum packed in the iconic squarish hard glass bottle as a global brand.</p>\n<p>Till the mid 2000s, it was the largest-selling liquor brand in the country, with heavy patronage from military canteens. Old Monk held its own even as other brands such as Golden Eagle Beer were weathering the onslaught of Vijay Mallya-led United Breweries group and other competitors.</p>\n<p>Yet, much of that market dominance seemed to have been achieved by word of mouth, than through conscious marketing efforts. “We do not advertise. I will not, and as long as I am in this chair, we will not (advertise),” Mohan had said in an interview in 2012. “The best way of my advertising is the product: When it comes to you and you taste it, you look at the difference and ask what is it. That is the best advertisement.”</p>\n<p>Mohan was the president of the municipal committee in Himachal Pradesh’s Solan, where the company had its distillery and brewery. In fact, one of the secrets of the success of Old Monk and other brands was the fact that the water was sourced from the same natural spring in Solan as it was 150 years ago, when the facilities were first set up. People close to him say the Padma Shri awardee was averse to change and wanted things done the traditional way.</p>\n<p>But the younger generation had other ideas. In mid 2000s, the family saw a separation with Rakesh ‘Rocky’ Mohan (son of V.R. Mohan), Kapil’s nephew breaking away. He eventually sold the company’s Lucknow facility to the Wave group of Ponty Chadha. In a short span of time, Chadha, who was seen close to the then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati, brought under his control the liquor business in UP and other northern states.</p>\n<p>The slide in Mohan Meakin’s fortunes coincided with the rise of Chadha. Meakin’s, which was once listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange, has since been delisted.</p>\n<p>By arrangement with<em> Business Standard</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212044/kapil-mohan-the-man-who-kept-traditions-alive-at-mohan-meakin-maker-of-old-monk-passes-away/\">Kapil Mohan, the Man Who Kept Traditions Alive at Mohan Meakin, Maker of Old Monk, Passes Away</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>A dictionary defines ‘sovereignty’ as “the quality or the state of being sovereign, or of having supreme power or authority; supreme or independent power or authority in government as possessed or claimed by a state or community”. So the question is: who in India has ‘supreme power or authority’ or ‘supreme or independent power or authority in government as possessed or claimed by a state’?</p>\n<p>The first response that comes to mind might be that “We, the People” are sovereign because the preamble to the constitution opens with these words. But do “We, the People” actually exercise ‘supreme power or authority’? In theory, yes, we do that every five years when we choose our representatives to sit in parliament. These MPs then support or oppose proposed legislations in accordance with the whips or other instructions issued by the political parties on whose tickets they got elected.</p>\n<p>The second possible response is an argument that is often heard: “parliament is supreme”. This is sometimes contested by saying that while the parliament can make laws, the laws are subject to judicial review since the constitutionality of those laws is finally decided by the Supreme Court. Even if it is accepted that parliament is supreme, it is worth trying to understand exactly <em>how</em> parliament works. The phenomenon of parliament being paralysed is so familiar that it does not need elaboration. <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vice-president-venkaiah-naidu-arajya-sabha-lost-34-hours-due-to-disruption-1796372\" title=\"Disruption has been a regular feature\" target=\"_blank\">Disruption has been a regular feature</a> of every session of the parliament over the last five or six years. I also <a href=\"http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120906/edit.htm#4\" title=\"wrote a piece\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a piece</a> on it in 2012.</p>\n<p><em>Who</em> disrupts parliament is not a mystery. It’s the political parties. There have been instances when the leader(s) of one or more political party(ies) announce(s) in the evening that they would not allow parliament to function the next day. And they actually carry out their intention, and get away with it. The question then arises whether parliament is sovereign or political parties are sovereign.</p>\n<p>Is the judiciary sovereign? The number of instances when the parliament (read political parties) has frustrated the decisions of the higher judiciary is legion. A couple of examples should prove the point.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211558/arun-jaitley-electoral-bonds-necessary/\" title=\"Arun Jaitley on Why Electoral Bonds are Necessary\" target=\"_blank\">Arun Jaitley on Why Electoral Bonds are Necessary</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>When the Supreme Court ordered disclosure of pending criminal cases by candidates contesting elections to parliament and state assemblies in the <a href=\"http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/jonew/judis/18463.pdf\" title=\"Association for Democratic Reforms\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Association for Democratic Reforms</em></a> (2002) case, parliament unanimously (meaning <em>all</em> political parties) supported the move to amend the Representation of the People Act to prevent the judgment from being implemented.

No action has been taken till date and a contempt petition is pending in the high court on this issue. This is an example of political parties being able to frustrate decisions of the higher judiciary.</p>\n<p>Arguably the most glaring instance of political parties being able to exercise ‘supreme power or authority’ even by blatantly defying statutory authorities is that of the attempts to apply the Right to Information Act (RTI Act) to political parties. The highest statutory authority in the country for the implementation of the RTI Act, the Central Information Commission (CIC), decided in a <a href=\"http://ciconline.nic.in//rti/docs/cic_decisions/CIC_SM_C_2011_000838_M_111223.pdf\" title=\"full-bench decision in June 2013\" target=\"_blank\">full-bench decision in June 2013</a> that six national political parties satisfied all the four conditions as mentioned in Section 2(H) of the RTI Act, and are therefore public authorities under the Act.</p>\n<p>All the six parties refused to comply with this decision of the CIC. When a complaint of non-compliance of its decision was lodged with the CIC, it issued several notices to the six parties, including show cause notices, but all the parties just ignored the notices and did not even deign to respond. The CIC then in a <a href=\"http://ciconline.nic.in//rti/docs/cic_decisions/CIC_CC_C_2015_000182_M_149924.pdf\" title=\"written decision in March 2015\" target=\"_blank\">written decision in March 2015</a> said that it was “bereft of the tools to get its orders complied with”. A petition has since been filed in the Supreme Court to get the “final and binding” order of the CIC implemented. It is still pending.</p>\n<p>What does the above show? That political parties, through the influence they exercise on MPs and MLAs, are able to defy the law of the land with impunity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/210430/electoral-bonds-transparency-in-political-funding/\" title=\"Much Ado About Nothing: Electoral Bonds and an Unapologetic Lack of Transparency\" target=\"_blank\">Much Ado About Nothing: Electoral Bonds and an Unapologetic Lack of Transparency</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>To answer the question ‘Who is sovereign in India?’ let us go back to the dictionary. It describes ‘sovereign’ as “<em>Group or body of persons</em> or a state having sovereign authority” (italics added). ‘Sovereign authority’, as we already know is ‘supreme power or authority’.</p>\n<p>So, which is that ‘group or body of persons’ who can defy the law of the land with impunity, and consequently exercise ‘supreme power or authority’? Isn’t the answer obvious?</p>\n<p>Why do we need to answer this question? Because the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211558/arun-jaitley-electoral-bonds-necessary/\" title=\"finance minister says that\" target=\"_blank\">finance minister says that</a> the “donors (are) reluctant to disclose the details of the quantum of donation given to a political party… because they fear consequences visiting them from political opponents”. This is what is commonly referred to as political vendetta.</p>\n<p>As a society, we are not able to ensure that our political parties do not engage in political vendetta (because they are sovereign), so we have to keep experimenting with all types of complicated instruments such as electoral trusts and electoral bonds in order to deal with the ill-effects of the misbehaviour of political parties. The use of unaccounted money is just one such misbehaviour.</p>\n<p>The finance minister is honest enough to say, “I do believe that donations made online or through cheques remain an ideal method of donating to political parties.” But he also says that “these have not become very popular in India since they involve disclosure of donor’s identity”.</p>\n<p>What he does not disclose is why a law can’t be passed which requires all political parties to forbid <em>all </em>political parties from receiving <em>all</em> donation by all means other than digital ones (remember the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/101916/photographs-prime-minister-paytm/\" title=\"full-page advertisements\" target=\"_blank\">full-page advertisements</a> in all newspapers in the period following demonetisation exhorting all citizens to make all payments by digital means)?</p>\n<p>The reason is that political parties are sovereign.</p>\n<p><em><a title=\"Jagdeep S.

Scientists from multiple fields spend their time and energy in inspiring and motivating more people into science.</p>\n<p>“In a free society, scientists funded by tax-based sources should obligate themselves to celebrate their discoveries with the public,” Neil deGrasse Tyson, a noted science television personality, astronomer and the director of Hayden Planetarium, New York, told <em>The Wire</em>. “Without a roadway between these places, paved by science festivals and videos and books and documentaries, we risk the public losing trust in science and scientists losing faith in the public.”</p>\n<p>The biggest particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, has a dedicated tour programme in English and French that attracts dozens of visitors every day. Throughout the year, CERN – the collider’s host lab – hosts a few thousand of visitors at permanent exhibitions, watch movies about research at CERN, visit parts of the collider tunnel and interact with scientists. CERN certainly stands out among other leading research institutions in terms of the number of visitors and the amount of resources spent on public outreach. They have been remarkably international and democratic through this exercise, welcoming citizens from all countries in the world.</p>\n<p>At NASA, there are numerous exhibitions, telescopes, launch pads, engineering sites and events that are open to the general public. Such programmes are conducted at regular intervals. It is straightforward for any US citizen or green-card-holder to enter a NASA campus for science exhibitions, events or guided tours. For Indian citizens, it usually takes about a week to get the necessary clearance. Permanent exhibitions and a visitor centre are common fixtures at NASA, and generally at most space agencies in the West.</p>\n<p>“In a democratic society, where the taxpayer’s money is used for any government activity, the public should know about how the funds are spent and they have the right to know,” Murthy Gudipati, a planetary scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, said. “For this reason, public outreach is a very important aspect of space science institutions such as NASA and the [European Space Agency], which have devoted staff who bring science and technology achievements to public in a language that is easy to understand, and which at times professional scientists and engineers may not be able to articulate in simple words.”</p>\n<p>(Gudipati spoke in his personal capacity; he does not speak for NASA or any other organisation.)</p>\n<p><strong>Lame excuses</strong></p>\n<p>At the European Space Agency (ESA), there are various public lectures and events conducted to radiate the spirit of ongoing space missions and the latest research. It is straightforward for any EU/EEA citizen to enter an ESA or ESTEC campus to attend such events and workshops anytime. For Indian citizens, it usually takes less than a week to get clearance from security to enter an ESA campus.</p>\n<p>According to Detlef Koschny, a planetary scientist and head of the Near Earth Objects Segment at the ESA HQ, Netherlands, “At ESA, we have a number of communications and educations activities, and I see again and again how important they are. Involving young people in particular – both male and female – gets a new generation interested in our activities that are important for shaping our future.”</p>\n<p>In this context, India has perhaps one of the more restrictive, unwelcoming and close-minded scientific establishments among the most scientifically advanced countries, especially in terms of conducting public outreach events on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>There is an important distinction to be made here, between more research-focused establishments, such as the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, etc., and institutions run by the Departments of Atomic Energy (DAE) and of Space (DoS). The former have a glut of outreach activities targeting school students, teachers and laypeople. The IISc <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/116513/open-day-iisc-iit/\" title=\"hosts an 'open day'\" target=\"_blank\">hosts an ‘open day’</a> every year, where one and all are invited to meet scientists on campus and try their hands at various ongoing experiments. The International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, hosts a monthly public lecture called ‘Kaapi and Curiosity’. Scientists from these institutes also travel the country giving talks and meeting the public for informal interactions.</p>\n<p>However, the DAE/DoS institutes, which conduct much less research while receiving the bulk of government research funding, leave much to be desired. For example, like Switzerland and France, India also has a particle accelerator at Kolkata, Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC). But it will be pretty hard to find an ordinary Indian citizen who has ever visited this place or attended any public outreach program here.</p>\n<p>In fact, most science school-level teachers of science or university professors have no access to such places and hardly get an opportunity to visit or learn about research conducted at such establishments. As a result, more Indians are likely to know a lot about CERN and a lot less about the VECC. Ironically, Indian citizens can access CERN, NASA and the ESA easier than our own facilities – be it the VECC or the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (Thiruvananthapuram). The restrictions and constraints imposed when attempting to visit places run by the Department of Atomic Energy or the Department of Space are usually justified with the lame excuses of ‘security’, fears of espionage, etc.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if CERN can set up a robust system to protect its more sensitive research from its visitors, why can’t India? The hassles of securing clearances required for foreign citizens or overseas scientists to enter some of the country’s research institutions are mind-boggling.</p>\n<p>A country with our research budget and resources can easily afford dedicated staff to deal with frequent visitors and outreach, if only there is an inclination for it. They would require simply a drop of funds and allowances from the ocean of government grants for research at the country’s top institutes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the many planetariums in our major cities are doing a great job reaching out to people – a feat research institutions can emulate. A planetarium’s staff and directors are usually more grounded and take an active interest in educating and engaging with students, school teachers and college lecturers from around the country. Autonomous research institutes run typically by the DAE/DoS do not conduct these programmes as often as our country needs them.</p>\n<p><strong>Education through outreach</strong></p>\n<p>“An even more important aspect of the public outreach is education. There are a wide variety of activities that NASA undertake, including scholarships for college students, K-12 educational materials, teacher-training in space sciences, visits by K-12 students to various NASA facilities, minority STEM programs, and so on,” according to Gudipati. “NASA scientists and engineers actively volunteer in local schools for mentoring students and give popular talks at” various places.</p>\n<p>The agency also has a dedicated TV channel aimed at both children and adults, complemented with an annual open house that provides a hands-on experience with NASA tech.</p>\n<p>In the West, public outreach plays an integral role in helping institutions using taxpayers’ money survive. Sheila Kanani, the education, outreach and diversity officer at the Royal Astronomical Society, London, said “We are very lucky that we are able to provide education and outreach activities for people from all walks of life and of all ages. We build rockets, make comets and ‘meet’ astronomers from the past and present.” According to her, the RAS considers space and astronomy to be “an inspiring way to get people involved in STEM subjects”.</p>\n<p>The funding system in India is different, so the space and nuclear facilities are least bothered about interacting with laypeople. However, even though there is no need to change India’s present research funding system for this reason, it’s about time officials get out of their protective bubbles. Such recalcitrance contributes to a pervasive suspicion among Indian citizens of nuclear reactors, sophisticated labs and particle detectors; it doesn’t help that some of these instruments are also located in difficult-to-reach areas. To paraphrase deGrasse Tyson, is it any surprise that people feel threatened by hi-tech science when hi-tech science refuses to trust them?</p>\n<p><em>Aswin Sekhar is an Indian astrophysicist based at CEED, University of Oslo, Norway.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212000/indian-institutes-labs-lacking-outreach-efforts/\">India’s Space and Nuclear Labs Are Visibly Lacking in Outreach Efforts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

One man was spotted waving a flag with a unified<span> Korea</span>n peninsula.</p>\n<p>Five senior officials from each side met at the three-storey Peace House on the<span> South </span><span>Korea</span>n side of the Panmunjom truce village from 10 am.</p>\n<p>The<span> North </span><span>Korea</span>n delegation walked over the border inside the joint security area (JSA) to the Peace House around 0030 GMT, a Unification Ministry official told reporters.</p>\n<p>Cameras and microphones are usually placed in the room to ensure that officials from both sides can monitor the<span> talks</span>.</p>\n<p>The US, which has 28,500 troops stationed in<span> South </span><span>Korea </span>as a legacy of the 1950-1953<span> Korea</span>n War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-<span>Korea</span>n meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>“A good thing “</strong></p>\n<p>The State Department had said Pyongyang “might be trying to drive a wedge” between Washington and Seoul and weaken a US-led campaign to force<span> North </span><span>Korea </span>to give up its development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the US.</p>\n<p>US President Donald Trump spent much of the past year deriding negotiations as useless and lobbing insults at<span> North </span><span>Korea</span>n leader Kim Jong Un, but recently Trump called the new<span> talks </span>“a good thing” and said they had been prompted by his “firm, strong” stance.</p>\n<p>Trump has said he would like to see<span> talks </span>go beyond the<span> Olympics </span>and added: “At the appropriate time, we’ll get involved.”</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the US State Department, Katina Adams, did not respond directly when asked about suggestions from some<span> South </span><span>Korea</span>n officials that the two<span> Korea</span>s could march under a single flag at the Olympic opening ceremony and even compete as a single nation in some events, but said:</p>\n<p>“We are in close contact with the Republic of<span> Korea </span>about our unified response to<span> North </span><span>Korea</span>, including the need to maintain pressure to achieve a denuclearised<span> Korea</span>n Peninsula.</p>\n<p>“Diplomatic options remain viable and open and the US remains committed to finding a peaceful path to denuclearising the<span> Korea</span>n Peninsula.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, Adams said Washington remained “clear-eyed about (<span>North </span><span>Korea</span>‘s) track record when it comes to negotiations” and added: “Time will tell if this is a genuine gesture.”</p>\n<p>US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reiterated last week that any future<span> talks </span>between the US and North Korea <span> </span>must be aimed at denuclearisation and warned that diplomatic efforts were backed by a strong military option if necessary.</p>\n<p>US Defense Secretary James Mattis and Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera spoke by phone on Monday and discussed “the importance of maximizing pressure” on<span> North </span><span>Korea </span>to abandons its nuclear and missile programs, the Pentagon said in a statement.</p>\n<p><span>South </span><span>Korea </span>and the US have agreed to delay joint military exercises until after the <span>Olympics </span>in a bid to reduce tensions and possibly create room for diplomacy.</p>\n<p>The<span> talks </span>come after<span> North </span><span>Korea</span>‘s Kim used his New Year’s Day speech to announce he was open to sending a delegation to the<span> Olympics </span>as well as reducing tensions on the<span> Korea</span>n peninsula, while vowing to never give up his nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>Ri, the committee chairman who was promoted to his current position in June 2016, is a seasoned negotiator for inter-<span>Korea</span>n<span> talks </span>although his previous experience has mostly been military-related due to his career in the armed forces.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211981/north-south-korea-begin-talks-winter-olympics-help-break-ice/\">North, South Korea Begin Talks as Winter Olympics Help Break Ice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Some Australian states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Because a month’s notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the Rieberos’<span> wedding </span>and several other same-sex<span> marriages </span>reported in the local press were among the first to be recognised under the new<span> laws</span>.</p>\n<p>Several same-sex couples already wed in December after the notice period was waived for reasons such as one member of the couple falling gravely ill, or to allow a legal<span> wedding </span>to go ahead when a non-binding ceremony was already planned.</p>\n<p>Religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition to same-sex marriage and pressed unsuccessfully for broad protections for religious objectors, which would have allowed florists and bankers to refuse service to same-sex couples if the unions were legalised.</p>\n<p>(<em>Reuters</em>)</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211923/australias-same-sex-wedding-laws-welcomed-with-midnight-marriages/\">Australians Welcome Same-Sex Marriage Laws with Midnight Weddings</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

She said she was returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London where she expected to be<span> paid </span>equally to men in equal jobs.</p>\n<p>“I am not asking for more money. I believe I am very well<span> paid </span>already – especially as someone working for a publicly funded organisation. I simply want the<span> <em>BBC </em></span>to abide by the law and value men and women equally,” she wrote on her website.</p>\n<p>Gracie said she was<span> paid £</span>135,000 ($182,800) a year as<span> China </span><span>editor</span>. According to last July’s disclosures, North America<span> editor </span>Jon Sopel earned between £200,000 and £250,000 a year, while Middle East<span> editor </span>Jeremy Bowen was in the £150,000 to £200,000 bracket.</p>\n<p>Europe<span> editor </span>Katya Adler, the<span> <em>BBC</em></span>‘s only other fe<span>male </span><span>editor </span>in foreign news, did not feature in the disclosures, meaning her pay was<span> less</span><span> than £</span>150,000.</p>\n<p>Gracie said managers had offered to increase her pay to £180,000, but that was no solution. She rejected the rise and insisted that all four of the<span> <em>BBC</em></span>‘s international<span> editor</span>s should receive equal pay.</p>\n<p>“I was not interested in more money. I was interested in equality,” she said during an interview on<em> </em><span><em>BBC</em> </span>radio.</p>\n<p>Britain enacted legislation<span> out</span>lawing sex discrimination in the 1970s and this was followed by an equality Act in 2010, but women still earn<span> less</span><span> than </span>men across much of the economy.</p>\n<p><strong>“Enough is enough”</strong></p>\n<p>The<em><span> BBC </span></em>defended itself by saying its gender pay gap was below the national average and<span> less </span>bad<span> than </span>at many other organisations, adding that it was committed to wiping it<span> out </span>by 2020. It also said an independent audit of rank and file staff had found “no systemic discrimination against women” at the<span> <em>BBC</em></span>.</p>\n<p>Several high-profile women seized on the Gracie story to say the problem was much bigger<span> than </span>the<span> <em>BBC</em> </span>and affected the whole of society.</p>\n<p>“Tip of the iceberg in @<span>BBC </span>&amp; most other orgs (organisations). Equality Act 2010 means no hiding place for shameful discrimination against women. Ending it long overdue,” wrote prominent lawmaker Harriet Harman of the opposition Labour Party, a long-time advocate of women’s equality, on Twitter.</p>\n<p>As in many other countries, pay inequality based on gender has been a persistent problem in Britain, which by some measures has performed worse<span> than </span>comparable European countries in recent years. Britain was ranked 15th in the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap index 2017, below France and Germany.</p>\n<p>But Gracie said her complaint was not ab<span>out </span>the gender pay gap the<span> <em>BBC</em> </span>admits to, which stems from men earning more on average because they do more of the best<span> paid </span>jobs. “It is men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal,” she said.</p>\n<p>Gracie accused the<span> <em>BBC</em> </span>of adopting a botched “divide and rule” response to the legitimate anger of fe<span>male </span>staff, offering pay rises to some women while locking down others in a protracted complaints process. In her own case, the process had been “dismayingly incompetent and undermining”, she said.</p>\n<p>“Enough is enough. The rise of<span> China </span>is one of the biggest stories of our time and one of the hardest to tell,” she wrote, citing Chinese state censorship, surveillance, police harassment and official intimidation.</p>\n<p>“I cannot do it justice while battling my bosses and a byzantine complaints process.”</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211918/paid-less-male-peers-bbc-china-editor-quits/\">Paid Less Than Male Peers, BBC China Editor Quits</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

However, the report has once again brought the role of former Hindu Mahasabha president Vinayak D. Savarkar into sharp focus.</p>\n<p>In his report, senior advocate Amarendra Sharan, who was assisted by his colleagues Sanchit Guru and Samarth Khanna, has noted that “the bullets which pierced Mahatma Gandhi’s body, the pistol from which it was fired, the assailant who fired the said bullets, the conspiracy which led to the assassination and the ideology which led to the said assassination have all been duly identified”.</p>\n<p>The amicus curiae also delved deep into Savarkar’s role in Gandhi’s assassination. He finally observed that “during the entire episode of the unveiling of the conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi, no suggestion has been put by any of the advocates either from the defence or prosecution or by the trial court that there was a larger conspiracy involving others apart from those accused”.</p>\n<p><strong>Of 12 accused, two were sentenced to death, three got life term</strong></p>\n<p>Following Gandhi’s murder at 5:15 pm on January 30, 1948, in the presence of a large number of people in New Delhi, the assailant was arrested on the spot and an FIR was registered half an hour later at Tuglaq Road Police Station. There were a total of 12 accused who were charged and prosecuted under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Arms Act, Explosives Substances Act and so on.</p>\n<p>Nathuram Godse and Narayan D. Apte were both convicted by the trial court on February 10, 1949 and the high court on June 21, 1949 and sentenced to death. Vishnu Karkare and Madanlal Pahwa were given life sentences by the high court. Shankar Kistayya was convicted by the trial court but acquitted by the high court. Gopal Godse was convicted and given a life sentence. Savarkar was acquitted by the trial court and let off as no appeal was filed in the high court. Dattatraya S. Parchure was sentence to life imprisonment by the trial court but acquitted by the high court. Digambar R. Badge turned an approver. Gangadhar S. Dandawate, Gangadhar Jhadav and Suryaeo Sharma absconded.</p>\n<p>Badge, who was granted a pardon on June 21, 1948, “disclosed the conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi. His statement was duly corroborated by independent witnesses,” Sharan’s report says.</p>\n<p>In November 1966, a one-man commission, under Justice Jivan Lal Kapur, was formed after the grandson of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, G.V. Ketkar, said that he had prior knowledge of the danger to Mahatma Gandhi’s life. A large number of witnesses were examined by Justice Kapur and the commission submitted its report on September 30, 1969. But “thereafter a quietus was given”, said the amicus curiae.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener\" data-bump-view=\"tp\" href=\"https://thewire.in/140667/savarkar-gandhi-assassination/\" title=\"How Savarkar Escaped Conviction For Gandhi’s Assassination\" target=\"_blank\">How Savarkar Escaped Conviction For Gandhi’s Assassination</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The commission had examined the “role of Savarkar” at length. The amicus curiae noted that “Vinayak D. Savarkar, who was the former president of the Hindu Mahasabha and was the foremost ideologue of the right wing Hindutva philosophy at the relevant time. His close relationship with both Nathuram V. Godse and Narayan Apte is well documented. However, Godse and Apte drifted apart from Savarkar on the issue of Savarkar supporting the Nehru led government in 1947 and hoisting of the national flag on 15.08.1947.”</p>\n<p>On Savarkar’s acquittal in Gandhi’s assassination case, the amicus curiae observed that “Vinayak D. Savarkar was acquitted of the charges of conspiracy by the Ld. Trial Court because the statement of the approver, PW 57, Digambar R. Badge with respect to his role remained uncorroborated”. But what remains intriguing is that “no appeal against his acquittal was filed before the Hon’ble High Court”.</p>\n<p>However, the report of the amicus curiae observed that “the Kapur Commission, which was set up in 1965 in its report dated 30.09.1969 has dealt with the role of Savarkar in detail”.</p>\n<p>Stating that the Commission had remarked on the matter at Page 317 of its Volume II, the report of the amicus curiae quoting the panel said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The statement of Appa Ramchandra Kasar, bodyguard of V. D. Savarkar (Ex. 277) which was recorded by the Bombay Police on 4th March 1948 shows that even in 1946 Apte and Godse were frequent visitors of Savarkar and Karkare also sometimes visited him. During the period when the question of Partition of India was being discussed all these three used to visit Savarkar and discussed with him the question of the Partition and Savarkar was telling Apte and Godse that Congress was acting in a manner detrimental to the Hindus and they should carry on propaganda through the agency of the Agrani against the Congress, Mahatma Gandhi and his dictatorial policy.</p>\n<p>In August 1947 when Savarkar went to Poona in connection with a meeting Godse and Apte were always with Savarkar and were discussing with him the future policy of the Hindu Mahasabha and told them that he himself was getting old and they would have to carry on the work.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of August 1947, on the 5th or 6th, there was an All India Hindu convention at Delhi and Savarkar, Godse and Apte travelled together by plane. At the Convention the Congress policies were strongly criticised. On the 11th August Savarkar, Godse and Apte all returned to Bombay together by plane.</p>\n<p>In the month of November 1947 there was a conference of All India State Hindu Mahasabha at Mahim and Dr.Parchure and Surya Dev of Gwalior also attended that meeting.</p>\n<p>In the middle of December 1947, Badge came to Savarkar to enquire after his health but he could not see him. But two or three days later he again came and had a 15-minute talk with Savarkar. Karkare, Apte and Godse also met him during that month twice or thrice.</p>\n<p>Gajanan Vishnu Darnle, secretary of Savarkar was also examined on 4th March 1948 by the Bombay Police. He said that he had known N.D. Apte of the Agrani for the last four years. Apte started a rifle club at Ahmednagar and also was an Honorary Recruiting Officer during the war. Apte was a frequent visitor to Savarkar’s house and sometime came with Godse. Savarkar had lent Rs. 15,000 to Apte and Godse for the newspaper when security was demanded from the Agrani. That paper was stopped and the new paper called the Hindu Rashtra was started. Savarkar was one of its Directors and Apte and Godse were the Managing Agents. He knew V.R. Karkare who was a Hindu Mahasabha worker at Ahmednagar for about three years and occasionally visited Savarkar. Badge was also known to him for the last three years. He also used to visit Savarkar.</p>\n<p>The statements of both these witnesses show that both Apte and Godse were frequent visitors of Savarkar at Bombay and at conferences and at every meeting they are shown to have been with Savarkar. In January 1948 they were travelling with him both from Delhi to Bombay and back. This evidence also shows that Karkare was also well-known to Savarkar and was also a frequent visitor. Badge also used to visit Savarkar. Dr. Parchure also visited him.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most importantly, the Kapur Commission had said that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“All this shows that people who were subsequently involved in the murder of Mahatma Gandhi were all congregating sometime or the other at Savarkar Sadan and sometimes had long interviews with Savarkar. It is significant that Karkare and Madanlal visited Savarkar before they left for Delhi and Apte and Godse visited him both before the bomb was thrown and also before the murder was committed and on each occasion they had long interviews. It is specially to be noticed that Godse and Apte were with him at public meetings held at various places in the years 1946, 1947 and 1948.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The amicus curiae observed that the commission had concluded that “All these facts taken together were destructive of any theory other than the conspiracy to murder by Savarkar and his group”.</p>\n<p>The amicus curiae, however, said, “to be fair, Shri Vinayak Savarkar died in 1966 and had no opportunity to present his case before the Kapur Commission or, to cross examine the witnesses who had appeared before Kapur Commission.” Further, he noted that “since the late Vinayak D. Savarkar had been acquitted, at this stage, it would neither be advisable/ desirable nor possible to come to a definitive finding with respect to Vinayak D. Savarkar’s role in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211917/not-possible-to-get-definitive-answer-on-savarkars-role-in-gandhi-assassination-says-amicus-curiae/\">Not Possible to Get Definitive Answer on Savarkar’s Role in Gandhi Assassination, Says Amicus Curiae</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

He had been trying to help officials form a power-sharing government to avoid any return to violence between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that scarred the province for decades.</p>\n<p>He will be replaced a<span> May </span>loyalist, Karen Bradley.</p>\n<p>The Liberal Democrats’ Alistair Carmichael said the reshuffle could be summed up as “nothing has changed”, repeating words used by<span> May </span>at one of the lowest points in her election campaign when she was forced to change policy over social care.</p>\n<p>“Theresa<span> May </span>wanted to reassert her authority but has come out of this looking weaker than ever,” he said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211930/troubled-2017-theresa-may-aims-changes-leadership-team/\">After a Troubled 2017, Theresa May Changes Leadership Team</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

On Sunday morning, while addressing a massive gathering of fans at a big marriage hall he owns in Chennai, Rajinikanth formally announced his entry into politics.</p>\n<p>“There is a need for a political change. The system needs change. We need a politics that is truthful, straightforward and clean. We need a kind of politics that is devoid of influence of caste and religion. We need ‘spiritual politics’. That is my goal and wish,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Politics in the state has deteriorated. Democracy has undergone severe decay. In the last year, the political events that unfolded in Tamil Nadu have made the people hang their heads in shame. People in all states are laughing at us. If I don’t do anything in a democratic way to change this situation, the feeling of guilt will affect me till my death,” Rajinikanth continued, adding that his foray into politics was the compulsion of time.</p>\n<p>What Rajinikanth referred to while speaking about the deterioration of politics in Tamil Nadu are the events that have unfolded in the state after the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa in December 2016. In fact, his joining politics provides a perfect cliffhanger to 2017 – a year marked by political chaos in the state.</p>\n<p>Rajinikanth then proceeded to recite a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, quoting Lord Krishna’s advice to Arjuna to keep at his work and not worry about the rest. “The time has come for me to enter politics,” he said.</p>\n<p><strong>The Rajinikanth story</strong></p>\n<p>Who is Rajinikanth and just why are people, cutting across various sections of civil society in Tamil Nadu, so fond of him?</p>\n<p>Contrary to the popular perception that Rajinikanth is a Kannadiga, the 67-year-old, whose name originally used to be Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, actually belongs to a caste named ‘Gaekwad’ in the Marathi community.</p>\n<p>Born in Nachikuppam village in Krishnagiri district on December 12, 1950, Rajinikanth’s father was a constable with Bangalore police. Krishnagiri district lies adjacent to Bengaluru, the state capital of Karnataka.</p>\n<p>Rajinikanth, who was interested in acting from the very beginning, initially worked as a bus conductor with the Bangalore Transport Service in 1973. He first acted in various plays before joining the Madras Film Institute to pursue a diploma in acting.</p>\n<p>His first chance to act in a movie was given to him by the late Tamil film director K Balachander. After <em>Arangetram</em> was released in 1975, a star was born. Now, 42 years later, he has acted in over 200 films – in 160 Tamil movies, 28 Hindi movies, and one movie each in Bengali, Malayalam and English.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08181717/rajinikanth759.jpg?fit=759%2C422\" data-orig-size=\"759,422\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08181717/rajinikanth759.jpg?fit=300%2C167\" data-attachment-id=\"211845\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Rajinikanth in the 2010 sci-fi film Enthiran (The Robot).

Credit: File photo</p></div>\n<p>Talk of his joining politics first emerged in 1995 when the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK government was in power. Trouble began to brew when Jayalalithaa dropped a minister, RM Veerappan – a senior leader in the AIADMK and a big film producer – after Rajinikanth spoke in a meeting that not even god could save Tamil Nadu if Jayalalithaa won the next election.</p>\n<p>His words were welcomed by the people at a time when the Jayalalithaa government was accused of being mired in corruption.</p>\n<p>Then, during the assembly elections and Lok Sabha polls of 1996, the Congress in Tamil Nadu underwent a split when late senior congress leader GK Moopanar broke away from the party when it decided to ally with Jayalalithaa.</p>\n<p>Moopanar launched his own party – the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) – and allied with the DMK. It was that alliance which swept the polls that. Jayalalithaa was defeated and the AIADMK secured only four seats in the 234-member assembly. Rajinikanth, who had given a clarion call to people to vote for the DMK-TMC alliance, was in the US when the elections took place and returned only after the results were declared.</p>\n<p>During the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Jayalalithaa decided to join hands with the BJP only to be defeated again. The DMK-Congress-Left alliance captured all 40 seats, including Puducherry. During the election, Rajinikanth asked his fans to vote for AB Vajpayee and openly said that he had voted for AIADMK-BJP alliance.</p>\n<p>Since that rout, Rajinikanth has largely been very guarded. Over the next few assembly polls – 2006, 2011 and 2016 – Rajinikanth told his fans that he was not supporting any political party.</p>\n<p>But after Jayalalithaa passed away in a Chennai hospital on December 5, 2016, talk of Rajinikanth joining politics, much like a long-awaited blockbuster, started to gain momentum.</p>\n<p><strong>Fears and prejudices</strong></p>\n<p>As the superstar is revving up to join politics, people belonging to minority communities are slightly skeptical and confused about his statements.</p>\n<p>“Rajinikanth’s statement, especially the bit about ‘spiritual politics’, means nothing and reflects BJP’s ideologies. His proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot be ignored. When Modi came to Chennai while campaigning for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he visited Rajinikanth’s house. That speaks volumes about our fears when the superstar mentions ‘spiritual politics,” said MH Jawahirullah, the president of Manitha Neya Makkal Katchi, an influential Muslim political party in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p>But the state BJP has outrightly rejected these fears. “This is not fear. This is prejudice on the part of Muslim groups. Spirituality and secularism are basically inherent core characters of Hinduism from time immemorial. This is not Rajinikanth’s problem, but the problem of Muslims,” said BJP state treasurer SR Sekar.</p>\n<p>To a large extent, seasoned political observers believe that Rajinikanth’s decision to join politics has a link with the BJP. “So far, Rajinikanth’s statements are unclear. Unless he launches his political party and issues a manifesto, I cannot comment properly. As of now, Rajinikanth’s decision is nothing but a film in the making. Once the film is released, then I can clearly opine on it,” said senior journalist Gnani Shankaran.</p>\n<p>“Rajinikanth is confusing spirituality with politics. When a couple of reporters asked him to explain what he meant by ‘spiritual politics’, he said it is the prevalence of <em>dharma</em> and justice. For preserving <em>dharma</em> and justice, you need not start a political party. His explanation for ‘spiritual politics’ is fundamentally wrong as it could only really mean ethical politics. But he is trivialising the whole issue. When a TV reporter asked him about what policies his new party would adopt, Rajinikanth laughed at him and added that the question made him giddy. As of now, with all the indications available, I can say that Rajinikanth is leaning towards the BJP version of politics,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Rajinikanth also made another important announcement: his party will not contest the local body elections that are likely to be held in March as there is too little time to prepare. “A few months before the assembly elections, I will launch a political party and explain our policies. My political party will not indulge in any agitations. For that, several other parties are available,” he said.</p>\n<p>“How can a political party survive without agitations? How could a political party shun local body elections, which are the backbone of our political system? I do not understand. For what is Rajinikanth launching a political party?” asks S Kannan, a Congress worker in Salem district.</p>\n<p><strong>The right formula</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few hurdles in Rajinikanth’s way. The first is money. Tamil Nadu is famous for its ‘cash for votes’ syndrome. In fact, as a former Congress MLA who is now with he AIADMK told this reporter, to contest and win an assembly seat in Tamil Nadu requires at least Rs 10 crore. The same was reiterated by a senior DMK MLA.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Thirumangalam</em> formulae’, which means the bribing of voters in a massive way, is a phrase that has made its way into several dictionaries. The term became popular after MK Azhagiri, son of DMK president M Karunanidhi, won the 2009 by-election in Thirumangalam, Madurai district, for his party through alleged ‘cash for votes’.</p>\n<p>But the bribing of voters can be dated back to 2003, when Jayalalithaa was ruling the state. It has been a norm ever since, be it assembly elections or Lok Sabha polls. In fact, between 2006 and 2011, when the DMK was ruling Tamil Nadu, it won all 11 by elections using this strategy.  In January 2009, before an assembly by-poll in Thirumangalam, near Madurai, was held, voters received around Rs 2,000 each to vote for the ruling DMK.</p>\n<p>Later, the Jayalalithaa’s AIADMK continued the trend, winning all 10 elections held between 2011 and 2016.</p>\n<p>Even though the Election Commission of India (EC) was aware of the situation, it could not do much to control the situation. This was expressed by several chief election commissioners (CEC) who have openly spoken about battling this practice.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/209611/is-rajinikanth-really-the-change-tamil-nadus-politics-needs/\" target=\"_blank\">Is Rajinikanth Really the Change Tamil Nadu’s Politics Needs?<br>\n</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>“The might of the Indian state has crushed armed groups and non-state players challenging the voting. Physically executing candidates, bombing voting booths and killing voters are all events of the past. Today, the EC can conduct any election, anywhere in India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari peacefully. But what’s happening in Tamil Nadu is mind boggling. We are virtually waging a war to prevent voters from being bribed. But political parties continue to hoodwink the EC. They are constantly changing their strategies scientifically and continue to bribe the voters” said former CEC SY Quraishi, at a public meeting in Chennai in January 2011.</p>\n<p>Tamil Nadu got a notorious distinction when the EC countermanded elections in two constituencies during the 2016 assembly elections. In its statement, the EC said that atmosphere in Aravakurichi and Thanjavur assembly constituencies was “seriously vitiated” due to the use of money. It happened again when the EC countermanded the RK Nagar by-poll in Chennai in April 2016. The seat had been left vacant after Jayalalithaa’s death.</p>\n<p>The EC justified its decision on the basis of a detailed report from the Income Tax (IT) department, which said that while they were raiding the Chennai residence of C Vijayabaskar, the health minister, evidence that indicated Rs 89 crore had been spent by AIADMK to bribe voters in RK Nagar was found. In the official order countermanding the by-poll, the EC fully reproduced the IT report.</p>\n<p>Now, if one were to look at the Rajinikanth factor in lieu of the ‘cash for votes’ syndrome, it’s obvious money will play an important role. Questions also arise about where the superstar will secure the money to contest the elections and run a political party.</p>\n<p>According to those in the know, both in politics and intelligence, Rajinikanth is not an ignorant man. “Rajinikanth is not a novice. He knows. The money may come from a big political party headed by a very big leader of India,” says a senior officer working in the Central Intelligence Bureau (IB).</p>\n<p>Rajinikanth’s origin is another problem. “There is nothing for him (Rajinikanth) to do here. Sons of soil are working here based on a constructive action plan. There is no problem in Rajinikanth acting in 10 more films. However, there is an issue in him becoming chief minister and governing us,” says Seeman, the leader of Naam Tamilar Katchi, a Tamil nationalist outfit.</p>\n<p><strong>Tamil Nadu’s idiosyncrasies </strong></p>\n<p>Tamil Nadu is a peculiar state in India – over the past 50-odd years, it has been ruled by people associated with the vibrant Tamil movie industry. When the DMK came to power in 1967, late CN Annadurai, popularly known as ‘Anna’ was chief minister till he died in 1969. He was replaced by M Karunanidhi. Since then, till December 5, 2016, when Jayalalithaa died, only three people – Karunanidhi, MG Ramachandran, or MGR, and Jayalalithaa – have ruled the state.</p>\n<p>This is an anomaly – no other Indian state has been ruled by just three people for 48 years, all of whom who had strong cinema backgrounds. Anna and Karunanidhi wrote screenplays and songs, while MGR and Jayalalithaa acted in hundreds of films.</p>\n<p>But there is a big difference between the five mentioned above and Rajinikanth. All of them had several years of political experience before becoming chief ministers. MGR was in active politics since 1957 and became an MLA in 1967 before becoming chief minister in 1977 after splitting away from the Karunanidhi-led DMK in 1972. Jayalalithaa entered active politics in 1982 and became a Rajya Sabha MP in 1984 and chief minister in 1991.</p>\n<p>But Rajinikanth has no such political experience. Does his brand of ‘spiritual politics’ stand a chance?</p>\n<p><em><a title=\"R. Ramamasubramanian\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/r-ramasubramanian/\">R.

It will make him weak. Let us go in once I feel composed,” she hastily tells her husband, Sanket, as she struggles to hold back her tears.</p>\n<p>It’s January 6, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/210479/dalits-others-across-mumbai-take-part-in-maharashtra-bandh-around-100-detained/\" title=\"three days since\" target=\"_blank\">three days since</a> her 15-year-old son was picked up by Chembur police for “unlawfully assembling on the street”, “rioting” and the most serious of all – “voluntarily causing grievous hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty”. Sarita’s son studies in class nine<sup> </sup>at a municipal corporation run school near Deonar. He is one of the 16 boys, all below 16, to be booked and later lodged at Dongi Children’s Home for their alleged roles in the riot and vandalism at Chembur on January 3. Sarita, like other parents, has come to see her son.</p>\n<p>One law student from her neighbourhood in Govandi had told her that her son Rahul might be kept in “jail” for ten years. “That boy told me the sections are grave. He opened some page on his mobile phone and read it aloud,” Sarita says. “<em>Ataa daha varshaa saathi gela samjha tumcha mulga</em> (your son has gone in for ten years now),” Sarita recalls his exact words.</p>\n<p>But once she steps inside the observation home and speaks to the social workers from Resource Cell for Juvenile Justice (RCJJ) – a Field Action Project started by the Centre for Criminology and Justice Department of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) – Sarita gets some clarity. “They (social workers) said under-18 children cannot be kept here for more than three years. But my son is still a child. He is innocent. I cannot let him be here for even a day more,” she tells <em>The Wire </em>while waiting outside the Probation Officer’s office, hoping to see her son.</p>\n<p>According to S Mane, senior police inspector from Govandi, Sanket, Rahul, along with 39 others, had indulged in vandalism and caused harmed to public property. These teenage boys, according to the police, were out on the street protesting against the violence unleashed on Dalits at Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1. But Sarita says her son was on his way to tuition class. “He was wrongly booked,” she repeats to everyone she speaks to in the next six hours inside the juvenile home.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/210755/bhima-koregaon-dalits-never-ending-search-nation/\" title=\"Bhima Koregaon and the Dalits’ Never-Ending Search for a Nation\" target=\"_blank\">Bhima Koregaon and the Dalits’ Never-Ending Search for a Nation</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The Kamble couple had to wait for over an hour before they meet Rahul.

Rahul stands there with his head bowed. “<em>Jail cha uniform aahe ka ha </em>(is this a jail uniform?),” she asks him. Rahul nods. By then four other boys join him. All of similar age, build and in similar striped t-shirts and brown shorts. They were all brought to Dongri home on January 3. Of the 16 children, one was released on the same day.</p>\n<p>“He was bleeding profusely. Mirror shards had pierced him deeply and ruptured his skin badly on the right side of his body.

But for three days, Rahul has been taking care of Aniket. When this reporter asked Aniket about his injury, he said that a police constable had hit him with a baton. “I was out protesting with my sister and mother at Deonar. We were a huge group. They let my sister and mother go and brought me here. Many boys from my area were picked up.”</p>\n<p>The families allege that the police did not spare anyone. “Police have launched a manhunt against our children. They arbitrarily arrested them,” says Sukhdeo Khairnar, whose 14-year-old nephew was also arrested. “Arrested for what? Is protesting illegal?” asks an elderly woman. Her 16-year-old grandson was also rounded up.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211424/beyond-bhima-koregaon-tale-dalit-maratha-relations-modern-maharashtra/\" title=\"Beyond Bhima Koregaon: A Tale of Dalit-Maratha Relations in Modern Maharashtra\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Bhima Koregaon: A Tale of Dalit-Maratha Relations in Modern Maharashtra</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>By 3 pm on January 6, the magistrate, Jyoti Purkar, calls all 15 children, one by one, to her chamber. Their parents are asked to furnish two independent sureties each. This means they had to find individuals with a regular job, stable income and the readiness to vouch for these children. Belonging to the lowest strata of the society, this is a lot to ask for. Families desperately begin making calls and scrounging for help. Within a few hours, some relatives and neighbours pour into the observation home. But the documents they’ve managed to assemble do not suffice. The last entry made in one of the bank passbooks was in 2014. Another person had come with his papers of his “zero balance bank account”. “Most women among us work as domestic help. Men in the family do odd-jobs. We do not have any family members with high income,” said one of the mothers.</p>\n<p>Finally by 4 pm, 13 families convince the Juvenile Justice Board. They children are then released against two “personal bonds” each.

People from Dalit Bahujan communities living here were also the ones who had travelled in huge number to Bhima Koregaon on January 1. Several private vehicles were booked to travel from different parts of Mumbai to Bhima Koregoan memorial. Most of them had to return mid-way after the violence on participants and visitors heading to the memorial.  Since this was also the 200th anniversary of the Bhima Koregaon battle, an occasion of great importance to Mahars, the crowd this year had gone up from a few thousands to over two lakhs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03192206/Maha-bandh-11.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03192206/Maha-bandh-11.jpeg?fit=780%2C532\" data-orig-size=\"780,532\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03192206/Maha-bandh-11.jpeg?fit=300%2C205\" data-attachment-id=\"210447\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;REUTERS&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Policemen stand guard at a traffic junction in Mumbai, India, January 3, 2018.

Instead of arresting those involved in terrorising our community, the police has been busy arresting our children,” Khairnar says. The Pune police are yet to arrest the prime suspects in the Bhima Koregaon attacks – Manohar alias Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ebute, both Brahmins and prominent Hindutva leaders.</p>\n<p>In Mumbai alone, close to 300 persons, all belonging to Bahujan communities have been arrested. The Directorate General of the Police’s control room confirmed a total of 502 FIRs have been registered across Maharashtra in the aftermath of the Bhima Koregaon violence.</p>\n<p>“We have not collated any data so far on the number of arrests made. But most arrests have been in Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nanded and some parts of Nagpur,” says the officer attending to calls on Monday morning. News reports from various district confirms the number of persons arrested could be anywhere between 4,000 and 5,000. At least 5,000 more have been booked, but yet to be arrested. Besides being a part of unlawful assembly, most of them have been booked under serious, non-bailable charges such as vandalism and attempt to murder.</p>\n<p>Advocate Darshan Ingole, one of the young lawyers who have been handling many of these cases, feels many of these charges might not even stand the scrutiny of the court. “Most of them are trumped-up charges. But the purpose is not to convict these young kids, but to instill terror in their minds. Can you even imagine what a family dependent on daily wages goes through if they have to visit the court and police station every day?” he asks.</p>\n<p>Activist and journalist Vaibhav Chaya feels Dalits Bahujans commonly get criminalised during such violent incidents. “This way, most youth will be kept busy in dealing with these criminal cases against them. Their energy and resources all diverted from (their) education and career. These cases end up criminalising the community <em>en masse</em>.”</p>\n<p>Chayya and several other young activists and lawyers have been working continuously since the day violence broke out at Bhima Koregaon. Besides coordinating with a network or lawyers and activists in most affected areas of Mumbai and other regions of the state, they have been busy putting out appeals to the Bahujan youths on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vaibhav.chaya/videos/10215231085998432/\" title=\"social media\" target=\"_blank\">social media</a> to protect their interests. “This is a tiring process. But it is only the community that can come together and salvage the situation during such times.”</p>\n<p><em>(Names of children and their families have been changed in order to protect their identities.)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211861/post-bhima-koregaon-violence-police-target-dalits-across-maharashtra-minor-boys-are-its-worst-victims/\">Post Bhima Koregaon Violence, Police Target Dalits Across Maharashtra; Minor Boys Worst Hit</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p>I don’t envy finance minister Arun Jaitley. The fiscal situation is looking rather grim, with the fiscal deficit target amount for the entire year having already been exceeded by 12 percentage points, with a full quarter of the fiscal year still to go. Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues, in particular, <a href=\"http://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/gst-collections-for-cotober-total-gst-collection-good-and-service-tax/story/264867.html\" title=\"have been disappointing\" target=\"_blank\">have been disappointing</a>, with monthly collections down to the Rs 80,000 crore mark from about Rs 95,000 crore in the initial few months.</p>\n<p>The situation on the direct taxes front appears to be better in the sense that they may just about meet their targets, but there is little chance that a part of the slippage in GST revenues could be compensated by the income and corporate tax collections. Non-tax revenues such as proceeds from disinvestment will need to play a far greater role if the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of GDP is still to be met. There are loud rumours that the target could slip this year.</p>\n<p>One of the key reasons the GST revenue uptake has been slipping is clearly the fact that to assuage small businesses (voters), a large number of commodities were moved from the 28% bracket to the 18% bracket, and in some cases, even lower tax brackets. In fact, as many as 178 items were moved from the 28% to the 18% slab in the GST council meeting of November 10, 2017. In addition, six items were moved from the 18% tax slab to 5% tax slab, eight items were moved from the 12% tax slab to 5% tax slab and six items were moved from the 5% tax slab to zero percent tax. All of these changes certainly have had a negative impact on revenues from GST.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211608/budget-2018-rural-distress/\" title=\"Budget 2018: Centre Must Tackle Unfulfilled Promises, Rural Distress as It Walks Fiscal Tightrope\" target=\"_blank\">Budget 2018: Centre Must Tackle Unfulfilled Promises, Rural Distress as It Walks Fiscal Tightrope</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>These ad hoc adjustments had to be made because the GST law was so poorly designed in the first place. Several experts, including the government’s own chief economic advisor, had opined that the top rate be kept at a reasonable level, that there not be a large number of rate slabs, that commodities like petroleum, real estate be kept in the GST net and that small businesses be kept out. None of the advice was taken. We have ended up with a hugely complex, difficult to administer and even more difficult-to-comply-with GST.</p>\n<p>But apart from the ad hoc reduction of rates, compliance issues have also had a big role to play in the declining collections. The fact is, when the GST rate is high, there is an equally high incentive to evade the tax. There is a concrete example from the European Union (EU). Until 2015, Romania had a high VAT rate of 24%, applicable on the vast majority of goods and services. At that time when Romania had this rate – one of the highest in the EU – its VAT gap, i.e., the amount of VAT lost due to non-compliance, was the highest in the EU at 41.1%. Romania cut the VAT rate to 19% from January 1, 2017. This rate cut followed the 2016 reduction from 24% to 20%. Romania had originally hiked VAT from 19% to 24% in 2010 at the height of the global financial crisis.</p>\n<p>In India, not only is the rate of 28% inordinately high, the overall structure of the GST design is overly complex with a number of tax rates. Apart from the standard zero rate on exports, the Indian GST has several other rate slabs: 0.25%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%. The zero rate applies not just on exports but on a host of other products such as food items and handicrafts. With this sort of a complex structure, there is always an incentive to try to game the system by looking for loopholes in the law or other means to reduce the amount of GST payable. Even though GST is an indirect tax and in theory, its incidence ought to pass through to the final consumer, the fact is producers and service providers know that if they can succeed in lowering the tax liability, they can offer their goods or services at more competitive prices to consumers.</p>\n<p>Apart from gaming the system, non-compliance is also taking the form of outright under-declaration of sales turnover. The rumour is that many retailers are under-declaring as much as 40% of their sales.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08163813/GST.jpg?fit=720%2C481\" data-orig-size=\"720,481\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08163813/GST.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-attachment-id=\"211801\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08163813/GST.jpg?resize=720%2C481&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211753/can-budget-2018-set-road-map-make-gst-truly-good-simple-tax/gst-5/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08163813/GST.jpg?fit=720%2C481\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"GST\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211801\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In India, not only is the rate of 28% inordinately high, the overall structure of the GST design is overly complex with a number of tax rates. Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>One of the ways the administration is planning to deal with this is to subject all interstate transfers of goods to e-way bills, i.e., trucks must carry these e-way bills with them as they cross state borders and then be subject to random checks. First, this will still do nothing to deal with the problem of undeclared services. Moreover, I wonder if this will not reintroduce the old practice of border check posts and long queues at state borders which the GST sought to eliminate. A more effective way may be to introduce real-time online data sharing with the tax administration, as several countries in Europe have done.</p>\n<p>Another major problem has been the high compliance burdens faced by small businesses. To ease this burden, the GST law provides for a “composition scheme” where eligible small businesses with sales turnovers up to Rs 1 crore can pay a flat rate of tax on their turnovers. Recent reports suggest that as many as 15 lakh small businesses have registered under this scheme, and about six lakh of them have filed returns and paid tax under it. The total amount of tax collected under this scheme is a paltry amount of Rs 251 crore, and officials are reported to believe there is widespread under-reporting. As I have said in earlier pieces, there is really no merit in forcing lakhs of small businesses with turnovers as low as Rs 20 lakh a year to register for the GST. The revenue collected from them will be very small and the compliance burdens imposed on them relatively very high. It is time to reconsider the threshold limit and revise it upwards to Rs 1 crore.</p>\n<p>My recommendation for a tax regime for small businesses is the following: the GST threshold be fixed at Rs 1 crore, with a provision for voluntary registration for smaller businesses; for income tax to continue with section 44AD but bring the ceiling limit back to Rs 1 crore in line with the GST threshold; allow this presumptive taxation only for those taxpayers who are not registered for GST; and, introduce a flat fee in the nature of a “business permit” of Rs 10,000 a year for businesses with a turnover between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore to be collected by state governments.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/209844/suresh-prabhu-gst-india-economy/\" title=\"Suresh Prabhu Predicts Sunny 2018 for India Inc While Ignoring Stormy 2017\" target=\"_blank\">Suresh Prabhu Predicts Sunny 2018 for India Inc While Ignoring Stormy 2017</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Data taken from the <a href=\"http://www.gstcouncil.gov.in/sites/default/files/CEA-rpt-rnr.pdf\" title=\"Report on the Revenue Neutral Rate and Structure of Rates for the Goods and Services Tax, 2015\" target=\"_blank\">Report on the Revenue Neutral Rate and Structure of Rates for the Goods and Services Tax, 2015</a>, Ministry of Finance, indicates that the vast majority of potential GST revenue would come from the top two brackets – “above Rs 100 crore” and “between Rs 10 crore and Rs 100 crore”. These two brackets have only 2.2% of taxpayers, but would potentially contribute over 80% of tax revenues. The distribution is highly skewed. In the table in the report, the number of small businesses with turnovers below Rs 1 crore is 8,111,026, which is as much as 86% of all potential taxpayers, however, their total turnover amounts to just 3.4%, which is also likely to be their share in GST tax revenue.</p>\n<p>Now, we know that GST rates are decided by the GST Council, headed by the Union finance minister and comprising representatives of all states, and so it is not possible for Jaitley to directly introduce proposals in the Budget for 2018-19 which would be enacted in the Finance Act, 2018-19. However, it would be excellent if the finance minister presented a road map for reforming the GST with a view to reducing its complexities and making it a truly “good and simple tax”.</p>\n<p>Both the minister and his secretary have at various times in the last couple of months indicated their willingness to go in the direction of a simpler GST with a three-rate structure, with a top rate of 18%. This would be most welcome, and I believe would increase voluntary compliance by reducing incentives to evade.</p>\n<p><em>Rajul Awasthi works for the World Bank on tax reforms.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>There is an emerging consensus that China is now a major player, maybe the major player, in global development finance. Recent studies have inspired <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-investment-u-s-1.4348001\" title=\"headlines\" target=\"_blank\">headlines</a> such as “China and US ‘neck and neck’ in foreign assistance spending”. Contrasted against the Trump administration’s apparent contempt for longstanding US support for global development promotion, such headlines seem yet further evidence of China’s emergence as a leader of global economic governance and influence. Yet this new conventional wisdom is often misleading and unhelpful. It tends to assume – rather than a question – how China and its economic and diplomatic partners in the developing world and beyond, understand and evaluate the actual “development” outcomes associated with the rising flows of official outbound Chinese finance.</p>\n<p>The rising narrative that China is now a leader of international economic development, and of development finance in particular, has been bolstered by a set of recent studies. The first is by a research team called AidData, whose recent October working paper called <a href=\"http://aiddata.org/publications/aid-china-and-growth-evidence-from-a-new-global-development-finance-dataset\" title=\"“Aid, China, and Growth: Evidence from a New Global Development Finance Dataset”\" target=\"_blank\">“Aid, China, and Growth: Evidence from a New Global Development Finance Dataset”</a> showed that Chinese government provision of what they call “official finance” to over a 140 countries between 2000-2014 amounted to over US $350 billion. The second is a <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/2016/05/Fueling-Growth.FINAL_.version.pdf\" title=\"series\" target=\"_blank\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/2016/06/Globalization.Final_.pdf\" title=\"studies\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> by a team of co-authors at the Global Economic Governance Initiative (GEGI) at Boston University which <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/2014/11/At-Issue-International-Architecture-final.pdf\" title=\"argue\" target=\"_blank\">argue</a> that through a combination of its state-owned policy banks (the China Development Bank or CDB and the China Export-Import Bank) and new multilateral financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), China “has become a global leader in development finance”. Both sets of studies are keen to point out that in a relatively short period of time, Chinese policy banks have equalled or surpassed the development assistance budgets of the US or of the development financing provided by multilateral institutions such as the World Bank.</p>\n<p>Yet beyond the headlines lie more complex realities. What both the AidData and GEGI studies find is that the lion’s share of what they both refer to as China’s “global development finance” comes not in the form of standard OECD official development aid (ODA), but instead in the form of commercial-term lending from China’s two policy banks. In practice, this means that less than 25% of what often gets lumped together under the umbrella of China’s “development assistance” comes in the form of grants, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12138/abstract\" title=\"export credits\" target=\"_blank\">export credits</a> and low interest (aka concessional) loans while the vast majority is in the form of commercial (aka non-concessional or near-market rate) loans. Indeed, since the China Export-Import Bank does the majority of concessional lending focused largely in Africa and Asia, this means the <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118176367.html\" title=\"CDB is the dominant Chinese overseas lending institution\" target=\"_blank\">CDB is the dominant Chinese overseas lending institution</a> specialising in commercial-term loans across a broad swath of regions including Latin America, Central Asia and Russia.</p>\n<p>Moreover, what both sets of studies show is that the vast majority of China’s commercial loans, but also a sizeable portion of the concessional ones, is directed at two sectors: energy and infrastructure. This means that China’s “development finance” is overwhelmingly in the form of commercial loans (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-dragons-gift-9780199550227?cc=nl&lang=en&\" title=\"and even the concessional loans are almost always in the service of commerce\" target=\"_blank\">and even the concessional loans are almost always in the service of commerce</a>) for energy and transport infrastructure deals, often to middle or even high-income countries (e.g. CDB’s largest energy loans portfolios are to Venezuela and Russia*).</p>\n<p>So why is any of this a problem? To be sure, both teams of researchers begin with the laudable objective of trying to shed light on the <a href=\"https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/chinese-foreign-aid--why-all-the-secrecy\" title=\"all-too-often opaque world of Chinese development aid\" target=\"_blank\">all-too-often opaque world of Chinese development aid</a> and finance provided by China’s policy banks. But even though these studies highlight the dominance of CDB commercial loans for energy deals, for example, there is almost no follow up on whether it makes sense at either a broader or more specific level to view such loans as making a contribution to development outcomes per se, however, those may be understood. Instead, while the authors of these studies are at pains to detail the nuances and wide range of effects on the countries receiving the loans from China, the idea that it’s all part of China’s contribution to “global development finance” is largely taken for granted.</p>\n<p>One reason the “developmental” nature of China’s policy bank loans to other countries is often assumed or at least glossed over is to be found in the name: the China Development Bank. As one GEGI study <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/2014/11/At-Issue-International-Architecture-final.pdf\" title=\"claims\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a>, “the CDB is perhaps the largest development institution in the world.” But what exactly does it mean to claim that CDB is a “development institution” compared, for instance, to any of China’s other state-owned banks or enterprises? Another reason for the almost automatic association of China’s policy banks with “international development” activities is linked to the emphasis Chinese leaders increasingly place on China as an engine of economic development, broadly conceived. <a href=\"https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/why-the-us-shouldnt-abandon-the-field-of-international-development-to-china\" title=\"China, unlike the OECD countries, is not wedded to the idea that development is synonymous with aid\" target=\"_blank\">China, unlike the OECD countries, is not wedded to the idea that development is synonymous with aid</a>. Given this fact, whether its policy banks are engaging in concessional or commercial lending, or its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or private firms are engaging in trade and investment, the Chinese leadership wants the world and its own citizens to view the entire package as part of China’s contribution to global development. Ultimately, the overseas lending behaviour of China’s policy banks must be put in the context of China’s broader industrial strategy and state-capitalist form of economic statecraft: the idea that state-owned banks engage in commercially-oriented lending is not in the least incongruous with the rest of China’s political economy.</p>\n<p>But this just underscores how important it is to move past simplistic assumptions, and propaganda, about the developmental nature of China’s “global development finance” and ask if and how the Chinese government’s provision of overseas finance, in both its concessional and commercial versions, is, in fact, contributing to development outcomes both outside and inside of China. To begin, it might behove analysts and policymakers to do a thought experiment by disassociating the term “development” from such concepts as China’s “global development finance” or even from the name of the China Development Bank itself. What if, for instance, we simply asked how China’s state-owned policy banks provision of either commercial or concessional loans impacted specific issue areas, such as <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fp_20171109_china_development_finance.pdf\" title=\"debt sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">debt sustainability</a>, in the host countries as well as in China itself? We might equally ask such questions of China’s energy or infrastructure finance without prejudging its developmental aspects.</p>\n<p>In fact, both the AidData and GEGI studies engage in exactly such an exercise when, for instance, they look at the growth, environmental and social impacts on the countries receiving loans from China’s policy banks. The results, inevitably, highlight complex outcomes but at the very least when <a href=\"http://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/mjtier/aidchinaandgrowth\" title=\"they show\" target=\"_blank\">they show</a> that China’s “less concessional and more commercially-oriented types of official finance do not boost economic growth” in host countries, or that the energy-focused nature of CDB and Export-Import lending <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/2016/05/Fueling-Growth.FINAL_.version.pdf\" title=\"often exacerbates existing environmental and social concerns\" target=\"_blank\">often exacerbates existing environmental and social concerns</a> in those countries, it is all the more reason to ask if and how China’s state-provided global finance is contributing to specific development outcomes. Broader, structural concerns about commodity dependency tied to Chinese loans-for-commodities deals in regions like <a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/KETD/fbin/mult/WP_1305_tcm348-370500.pdf\" title=\"Latin America\" target=\"_blank\">Latin America</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WP_16-09_BBVA_China-Africa.pdf\" title=\"Africa\" target=\"_blank\">Africa</a> simply underscore the need to question the developmental outcomes tied to China’s official global finance.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the finding that the majority of China’s official finance is based on commercial terms and that it does not contribute to economic growth in the host counties should be as headline-grabbing as anything. But just as important as such questions are for the countries on the receiving end of Chinese state-led provision of international finance, they are just as or even more important for China itself. For example, to what extent does Chinese state lending overseas create new financial risks or exacerbate <a href=\"https://www.merics.org/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/China-Monitor/171017_Merics_ChinaMonitor_42.pdf\" title=\"existing concerns about domestic debt sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">existing concerns about domestic debt sustainability</a>? Chinese officials, as well as bank and SOE leaders, often argue that state support is necessary for energy deals in order to guarantee energy security or that China’s own record in building infrastructure is definitive proof that it can and should finance and build infrastructure abroad. But to what extent are such arguments justified versus simply justification for seeking preferential access to subsidised government finance and other forms of support? In a country where the lending of hundreds of billions of dollars abroad by its policy banks is largely immune from public scrutiny and criticism, China’s citizens are left with little choice other than to simply trust that their leaders are, in fact, doing the good work of “development” that they say they are.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, the CDB and Export-Import Bank will continue to lead the way in terms of China’s provision of official finance abroad. Yet China has already begun to diversify the institutions and approaches it uses to provide international finance and promote development beyond its borders more broadly. Especially compared to its unilateral policy banks, there is reason to hope that new China-led but multilateral financial institutions such as the AIIB and New (or BRICS) Bank, as well as China’s continued participation in existing multilateral institutions like the World Bank and United Nations, will be more conducive to addressing hard but important questions about the meaning and content of “development” both for China and its developing country partners.</p>\n<p>Yet no matter the form or institutional vehicle, what all of the recent and worthwhile efforts to shine a light on China’s notoriously opaque flows of official finance demonstrate is that neither rigorous analysis nor good policy is possible in the absence of clear concepts. Any efforts to better understand China’s growing role in global development finance, and its impact on development outcomes more generally, must confront head-on the difficult but crucial question of what is and what should be the meaning and content of development itself.</p>\n<p><em>*AidData reports that Russia, at US $36.6 billion, is the top recipient of China’s commercial or “other official finance” while Venezuela comes in fifth, at US $10.8 billion. Yet Kevin Gallagher, the head of the GEGI projects, has found in his <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/research/gegi/program-area/chinas-global-reach/china-in-latin-america/china-finance-and-investment/china-latin-america-database/\" title=\"database of Chinese lending to Latin America\" target=\"_blank\">database of Chinese lending to Latin America</a> that Venezuela alone has received over US $60 billion in Chinese policy bank loans since 2007. Obviously, this figure would place Venezuela as by far the top recipient of Chinese government loans.</em></p>\n<p><em>Matt Ferchen is an associate professor in the Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>In 2008, Mike Merrill, 30-year-old IT specialist in Portland, Oregon, decided to turn himself into a publicly traded entity. Hundreds of investors bought bits of him for $1 a piece and, eventually, turned those bits into voting power. The gimmick earned Merrill a few gushing magazine profiles, while his investors vetoed his vasectomy.</p>\n<p>Technically, Merrill is about two years too old to count as a millennial (as those who born between 1980 and 2000 are generally defined), but him selling his soul to the market signalled a sea change. In <em>Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials</em>, author Malcolm Harris argues that most millennials are at least a little like the capitalised Merrill (who isn’t mentioned in the book). That is, they think of themselves as investments – human capital.</p>\n<p>We can see the symptoms of Harris’ conclusion all around us: the infamous “helicopter parent” controls every hour of their child’s life to enhance their offspring’s capital, and one can see the metastasising obsession with marketable skills through a global growth in STEM education. We millennials speak of personal brands, of investing in ourselves, and we begin training ourselves for future careers at younger and younger ages. At the same time, Harris marshalls data showing that millennials, at least in the United States, are historically unhappy, anxious and competitive.</p>\n<p>The book asks a straightforward question: why did millennials get this way? To find an answer, Harris looks at industries from education to entertainment, identifying common trends that have profoundly transformed work and life.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08150945/Kids-these-days-Malcolm-Harris.jpg?fit=331%2C499\" data-orig-size=\"331,499\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08150945/Kids-these-days-Malcolm-Harris.jpg?fit=199%2C300\" data-attachment-id=\"211736\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Harris&lt;br /&gt;\nKids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials&lt;br /&gt;\nLittle, Brown&lt;/p&gt;\n\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08150945/Kids-these-days-Malcolm-Harris.jpg?resize=238%2C359&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211729/capitalism-and-the-millennial-soul-book-review/kids-these-days-malcolm-harris/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08150945/Kids-these-days-Malcolm-Harris.jpg?fit=331%2C499\" alt=\"Malcolm Harris Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials Little, Brown\" data-image-title=\"Kids-these-days-Malcolm-Harris\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211736\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Malcolm Harris<br><em>Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials</em><br>Little, Brown</p></div>\n<p>At its core, Harris argues, the birth of the millennial is a product of political economy. “We didn’t happen by accident,” he writes. Rather, millennials turned out the way they did because, over the past half-century, “capitalism emerged as the single dominant mode of organising society”.</p>\n<p>Harris sees capitalism, in its purest form, as an engine for producing profit. As labour became automated and workers more productive than they’d ever been, any given worker became increasingly expendable to her employer. Meanwhile, as social safety nets in developed countries withered away, labourers became more desperate for work. In the end, workers need jobs more than employers need workers.</p>\n<p>And so the rat race begins.</p>\n<p>Even as children, future workers race each other for coding, math, or advanced athletic skills in the hope of obtaining one of the few remaining stable jobs. It’s a wonderful deal for bosses: with so many people vying for good work, applicants will do anything to make themselves stand out, including working around the clock, or for free. In this vein, Harris argues that even school children are unpaid labourers, since they accumulate human capital for the benefit of future employers. Once they grow up, they will join a precarious labour force (which other writers have called the “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Precariat-New-Dangerous-Class/dp/1472536169\" title=\"precariat\" target=\"_blank\">precariat</a>”) that dare not dream of jobs with benefits, job security, or collective bargaining. Instead, they get multiple part-time jobs with no stability.</p>\n<p>By Harris’ reckoning, millennials are the first generation that came of age under this new labour regime, and it makes their lives miserable. In the US, free time is historically scarce, and every hour of rest is a potential liability if your competitors are willing to forego it. Accumulating human capital is almost a moral imperative, a point that might help explain why being overworked and sleep-deprived has become a <a title=\"status symbol\" href=\"https://thewire.in/114506/name-place-animal-thing-on-the-limits-of-hard-work/\">status symbol</a>.</p>\n<p>Devastatingly, Harris writes that “like cell phones that are only meant to be turned off for upgrades, millennials are on 24/7”. While pundits wring their hands over millennials’ addiction to social media, Harris sees that shift as an adaptation: with work colonising more and more of young people’s time, social life flees onto portable smartphones, where friends can communicate more efficiently.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08151129/Malcolm-Harris.jpg?fit=400%2C534\" data-orig-size=\"400,534\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08151129/Malcolm-Harris.jpg?fit=225%2C300\" data-attachment-id=\"211738\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Harris.

Courtesy: Little, Brown and Company</p></div>\n<p><em>Kids These Days</em> focuses overwhelmingly on the US, and one could argue that Harris’s narrative holds less true in the non-Western world. The rise of precarious labour only seems a dramatic aberration when contrasted with the stable employment of the mid-century welfare state. In much of the developing world, that relative security never existed, and precarity, while it may have worsened, is not as unfamiliar a creature.</p>\n<p>Still, evidence suggests the broader shifts Harris describes – the erosion of job security and the frenzied pursuit of human capital – represent a global trend. A recent <a href=\"http://www.manpowergroup.com/wps/wcm/connect/660ebf65-144c-489e-975c-9f838294c237/MillennialsPaper1_2020Vision_lo.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"report\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> suggests that Indian millennials work 52 hours a week, significantly longer than in the US. When I saw him speak in Philadelphia last month, Harris said readers from around the world had reached out to him, seconding his findings in their own lives.</p>\n<p>What is to be done? On this point, Harris is ostentatiously coy. “[B]ooks like this are supposed to end with a solution, right?” Harris asks, and then proceeds to eviscerate every solution –Protest! Donate! Boycott! – he can think of. “The only way to win,” he concludes bitterly, “is not to start.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, he seems more interested in indulging his pessimism, taking half the conclusion to run through seven nightmarish scenarios that he thinks are likely to play out if current trends continue. Still, he can’t resist tacking on a two-page addendum where he predicts a mysterious future reckoning during which “[millennials] become fascists or revolutionaries, one or the other”. That projection counterbalances some of Harris’ resignation, but it’s hardly a blueprint for change.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the book’s mission is simply to paint a target, not give us the bullets to shoot it with, which is okay. But even the target is a little too vague. We understand that the job market is bad and that it has something to do with unchecked capitalism and technological innovation, but what has happened politically to make this shift possible? While the book provides a coherent history of contemporary labor relations, it says less about the role of larger political processes – Reaganomics or Thatcherism or the global collapse of socialist parties – in the rise of precarity.</p>\n<p>Instead, the book seems to blame an unholy mixture of technological progress and greedy US Republicans – an under-sized explanation for a world-historical transformation like the rise of neoliberalism. Without a robust theoretical throughline, much of the book devolves into well-researched but sometimes glib vignettes about how the changing nature of labour has affected sports, porn, education, and a few other industries.</p>\n<p>The result is still an illuminating romp through the symptoms of a condition, but one that fails to satisfyingly name the disease or its causes.</p>\n<p><em>Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials by Malcolm Harris, is published by Little, Brown. </em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211729/capitalism-and-the-millennial-soul-book-review/\">How the Triumph of Capitalism Shaped the Millennial Soul</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

So I guess and that’s why I believe the British coming to India was a positive…event?”</p>\n<p>As my friend stumbled through the sentence, he looked up from what he had scribbled on the blank sheets at the back of his history notebook. He was faced with the arduous task of defending British rule in India for a middle school debate set up by a misanthropic teacher who had a personal grouse. My friend was rewarded for his effort with the sight of faces filled with seething prepubescent patriotism. To say the experience put him off public speaking is a disservice to the damage done.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, what strikes me about the memory was the sheer vitriol we held towards the British. The colonisers! The invaders! The looters, we were told. And all very legitimate things. It seemed as if three centuries and thousands of British bodies hadn’t produced one sympathetic figure (Mountbatten was confusing and the other one that came to mind was Elizabeth from the movie <em>Lagaan</em>).</p>\n<p>In the midst of such thoughts, Sir Arthur Cotton entered without much fanfare. I wouldn’t have even noticed him had it not been for the statues. Driving past the districts on either side of the Godavari, the statues are subtle but visible. Plaques call him <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Saluting-Sir-Arthur-Cotton/article15222768.ece\" title=\"apara bhageeratha\" target=\"_blank\"><em>apara bhageeratha</em></a> (the divine king who bought down the Ganges to Earth), or a less epic Cotton <em>dora </em>(roughly translates to Lord Cotton). Farmers put garlands on his statues to show respect.</p>\n<p>An evangelist, general and engineer, Sir Cotton was the architect of some of the grandest river-based projects that were completed in the 19th century that continue to function to date.</p>\n<p>One of the few colonial administrators loved by the people, and disliked by his own colleagues, Sir Cotton ensured the <a href=\"http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Sir_Arthur_Cotton_Barrage_/Godavari_Barrage_B00131\" title=\"construction\" target=\"_blank\">construction</a> of Dowleshwaram Barrage – an irrigation structure constructed across the Godavari before it merges with the Bay of Bengal. Another mammoth construction under his guidance was the <a href=\"http://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/static/approjects/prakasam.html\" title=\"Prakasam Barrage\" target=\"_blank\">Prakasam Barrage</a>, constructed across the Krishna river in Vijayawada, which still caters to the irrigational needs of the region.</p>\n<p>That there are <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Saluting-Sir-Arthur-Cotton/article15222768.ece\" title=\"roughly 3,000 statues\" target=\"_blank\">roughly 3,000 statues</a> of the man on either side of the Godavari gives a hint of the respect he still holds amongst farmers. Despairing at the way Godavari ravaged the surrounding districts, he pleaded before the House of Commons to spend money on irrigation facilities instead of railways. <a href=\"http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2002/10/14/stories/2002101400650900.htm\" title=\"He is quoted to have said\" target=\"_blank\">He is quoted to have said</a>: “My Lord, one day’s flow in the Godavari river during high floods is equal to one whole year’s flow in the Thames of London.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/209830/bengal-famine-documentary-british-empire/\" title=\"Digging Up British Empire’s Bloody Legacy in India\" target=\"_blank\">Digging Up British Empire’s Bloody Legacy in India</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>During his travels across the world, Sir Cotton always thought about how he could best use his knowledge of irrigation towards the betterment of the places he visited. He travelled across Europe into Egypt and then crossed the desert into Baghdad. The city had gone through a plague, a flood and a siege by the time he got there.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ghent and Brussels, crossing and inspecting the field of Waterloo, on which he remarks with characteristic acumen:–</p>\n<p>“With the help of a book we had with us we made out the site of the battle perfectly. It appeared to me the finest piece of ground for a general action that could be imagined; there was sufficient variety of the level to show clearly the state of the field throughout, and at the same time not so much broken as to prevent any army from being used with full effect”.</p>\n<p>“From Geneva to Lyons and other regions, and so by way of Avignon to Marseilles, he leisurely proceeded. Much of the country was of a dreary character, rocky and barren, and reminded him vividly of the worst parts of India.”</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“…and so by a roundabout route to Jerusalem. Afterwards he passed through Samaria, making a detour to take in Mount Carmel, and so to Damascus.”</p>\n<p>“From Damascus the party had planned to proceed to Bagdad, and were arranging for camels and horses…”</p>\n<p>“You may have heard that the year before last, out of sixty thousand inhabitants of Bagdad, fifty thousand died of the plague, and at the same time the whole city was laid several feet under water by a flood while an army was waiting to besiege it, which took up its ground before the wall as soon as the water retired. The present appearance of the city corresponds with these occurrences.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of his preliminary observations was to build a canal that connected the Euphrates straight to Baghdad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Among other works in contemplation is the establishment of a regular line of steam boats on the Euphrates, and the cutting of a canal to connect that river with Bagdad, at the expense of the Pasha, thereby completely…”</p></blockquote>\n<p>But he was so sick and exhausted that the locals built a grave for him in case he died a few days later.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“But for your kind husband, Captain Cotton would not, humanly speaking, have got through his illness at Bushire, so ill was he, and so near death.. I doubt if he can remem­ber anything about the matter?’”</p>\n<p>“… at a public meeting by a gentleman, whose name he could not remember, but who informed him that thirty years previously he was in command of the escort of the British Resident at Bushire, and had had charge of his funeral arrangements. My father often used to remark that ” he supposed he was himself the only man who had ever visited his own grave.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>But he marched on and survived.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/08133145/Dowleswaram_Barrage.jpg?fit=1200%2C676\" data-orig-size=\"1200,676\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/08133145/Dowleswaram_Barrage.jpg?fit=300%2C169\" data-attachment-id=\"211709\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/08133145/Dowleswaram_Barrage.jpg?resize=1160%2C653&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/207183/british-general-master-irrigation/dowleswaram_barrage/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/08133145/Dowleswaram_Barrage.jpg?fit=1024%2C577\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Dowleswaram_Barrage\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211709\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dowleswaram Barrage.

For a long period no rain had fallen, and this letter described the dying of the cattle and sheep from sheer inanition, dried-up stream-beds and the utter absence of grass everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“…on subjects very near his heart, and said : “If they had only taken my advice, given so many years ago, they would have saved fortunes, and gained others over and over again.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The ‘rice bowl’ of Andhra Pradesh – the Godavari region – is credited to his vision and he had a grander scheme of implementing such a large scale project across India, to connect all rivers. His vision extended beyond the Madras presidency that he served as he wanted to connect India from Calcutta to Karachi and Indus to the Nilgiris.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Pray consider what I say about your proceeding as soon as you can see your way a little. What is wanted is the connection of the various irrigations, so as to com­plete steamboat communication from Ludiana, by the Sutlej, Jumna, Sone, Ganges, Mahanudi, Godavari, Kistna boat canals, and one from Nellore through the Carnatic to Ponany, so as to bring produce to a point apposite to Aden at an almost nominal cost. That’s the grand object”</p>\n<p>“The above letter referred to a large scheme which had been projected for a canal from the Ganges at Sahibgunj to Calcutta, but which was indefinitely shelved.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>He aimed to tame rivers so as to limit damage during floods and famines and create a navigation system that would prove to be more cost effective than the railways.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I wish we could somehow get Messrs. F. to understand the extraordinary circumstances of Kurrachee, that it must inevitably become one of the principal ports, if not the first ; that it is the natural outlet of the whole of North India and of all Central Asia ; and this, with its accessibility and nearness to England, gives it advantages which nothing can possibly counteract.”</p>\n<p>“But that the one thing it wants is <em>cheap </em>communication up the valley of the Indus. If a railway could carry at a halfpenny a ton, it would cost £3 10s. from the North-West ; while a canal, at a tenth of a penny, would charge ten shillings, making a difference of two millions a year on a single million tons of wheat and other grains only, even when the prices in England allow of railway prices at all ; but the fact is, it would make the difference between such a trade and none at all.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>His serious contributions to India began with the construction of anicuts to control the tumultuous Cauvery river and to boost life and prosperity in a decaying Tanjore district. <strong><br>\n</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>“He was appointed to the separate charge of the Cauveri Irrigation, which formed part of the Southern Division, with oversight and responsibility in regard to the Paumben works. Special study was given to the needs of the Tanjore district, and the moods of the Coleroon River were regarded in almost every possible light, with the view of making that great stream of the utmost possible service. The need for wide-reaching works was excep­tionally great. Absolute ruin stared Tanjore and the adjoining districts in the face. ”</p>\n<p>What did Arthur Cotton do in Tanjore ?</p>\n<p>He devised a great scheme for controlling the river Cauveri, and saving its almost priceless water from running to waste.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The construction of canals helped in navigation. Barrages and reservoirs helped irrigate fields. The net returns of the Cauvery Delta increased massively.</p>\n<table width=\"1115\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cauvery Delta System\n<p>“The net return, after paying interest charges, was 37.91 percent on the capital outlay against 41.26 in the previous year.”\n<td>8,00,867</td>\n<td>2,35,38,320</td>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: General Sir Arthur Cotton, page 339</em></p>\n<p>Sir Cotton detested the colonial project of railways and considered it a waste of resources and evidence of the British draining wealth from the country.</p>\n<p>Expenditure from revenue and capital:                     £</p>\n<table width=\"490\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Railways</td>\n<td>246,609,235</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Irrigation</td>\n<td>39,359,045</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance against irrigation</td>\n<td>207,250,190</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Source: General Sir Arthur Cotton, page 356 (summation from years 1882/83 – 97/98)</em></p>\n<p>He persisted for far more investment in canals meant for irrigation and navigation. In his book, <em>Public Works in India, Their Importance: Suggestions for their extension and improvement, </em>he goes on to prove that it is far cheaper per ton per mile to transport cargo and passengers through canals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“portion of all the traffic of India, transit can be effected at one pie or one-eighth of a penny per ton per mile, our main object will be already gained.”</p>\n<p>“All goods are carried at about three annaa a ton per mile ; and if the cost were reduced to one pie, it is impossible to say what the traffic would be : but there can be little doubt that it would be increased five or six fold, or to a million tons per annum.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of his critiques of the railways was that it laid an unnatural emphasis on the high speed of transit as opposed to focussing on cheap forms of public transport. The relevance of this argument in the times of bullet trains cannot be overstated. He argued that if India were to have an equitable distribution of wealth in such a way that interior continental towns could be part of the development process, navigation set through canals would provide a better path than depending heavily on railways.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the railways expect to be able to carry goods at two pence-half penny per ton, which for four hundred miles would be £ 4, or two-thirds of what it is now, in which case £ 8,000,000 more must be placed against the railway, making the expenditure on that line £ 23,000,000, against £17,00,000 by the river ; or thirteen times as much as the latter. Even allowing the railway to be worked for nothing, there would be a difference of £ 12,000,000.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“The fundamental error in regard to railways is the assumption by the authorities that if ” the problem of <em>famine relief” </em>be ” nearly solved,” that is enough. A con­fusion of ideas in regard to ” relief” and ” prevention.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>His greatest achievement was the transformation of the districts surrounding Godavari which used to depend heavily on seasonal rainfall and on the river’s mercy. In 1831, there was very heavy rainfall and in the following years, a cyclone and drought followed, leaving locals to the nature’s whims.</p>\n<p>Added to this, the industrialised production of cotton clothing in England had cut down the demand for locally-made artisan cloth produced around the Godavari.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Factories for the manufacture of a special kind of cotton cloth, much in favour with the people, were, at a <em>very </em>early period, established by the East India Company. These, however, were discontinued as the Arkwright and other spinning and weaving inventions made use of by British manufacturers greatly cheapened the production of such fabrics and made the Indian cloth unprofitable. No other industry took their place, and there was much suffering among the people. Deterioration set in There was nothing but the soil for the erstwhile spinners and weavers to turn to.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>The distress was terrible all over those northern districts. In the adjoining district of Guntoor, two out of five of all the people died. Guntoor had five hundred thousand inhabitants when the famine began : there were but three hundred thousand when it had passed away. In Godavari itself one out of four perished.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But after working in the area for decades and weaving canals across the Godavari that extended till the Krishna river, the local average revenue increased by 250%.</p>\n<p><em>Increase in revenue </em></p>\n<table width=\"470\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>From all sources in 1843-44</td>\n<td>Land Revenue only in 1898</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rs 17,25,841</td>\n<td>Rs 60,19,224</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Increase of Rs 42,93,383 – Nearly two and a half times greater</em></p>\n<p><em>Source: Sir General Arthur Cotton, page 84</em></p>\n<p>More importantly, the abundance of water saw the crop pattern and diet change from being corn-based to rice-based, which continues in Telugu-speaking states till today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The prosperity of the ryots is evident to the most casual observer.”</p>\n<p>” The gradual substitution of tiled houses for thatched”,</p>\n<p>“the better dress which is being worn by the ryots,</p>\n<p>“the more universal adoption of rice as an article of diet rather than Indian corn and other dry grains formerly in almost universal use.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the last decade of the century, the Godavari districts generated the most amount of revenue for the presidency, second only to Tanjore, which too had its irrigation set up by Sir Cotton.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The district, as a whole, from a revenual point of view, has leaped from the thirteenth place among the twenty-two districts of the Madras Presi­dency to the second place.

Credit: YouTube</p></div>\n<p>Great men often tend to find themselves in situations where their expertise is questioned by those in the bureaucracy. But unlike many of the arrogant geniuses that pop-culture has fed us in the recent past, Sir Cotton remained calm and answered over 900 questions while facing a select committee in the House of Commons in 187<em>8</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is why so much space and consideration are given in this chapter to the enquiry of 1878. While more than nine hundred questions were asked of him, in that year, less than three hundred were asked in 1872.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is important to note that not only did the committee not have irrigation engineers, it barely had civil servants who had served in India.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Here was a body of Englishmen, fairly representative Of the composite character of our nation, not one of whom was an engineer ; not a single one of them had had the slightest acquaintance with irrigation engineering. Of actual Indian administrative experience there was only Sir George Campbell.</p>\n<p>Sir George Campbell ought not to have sat on this Com­mittee. As a witness he might be of service ; as a judge he was in the position of one who had already made up his mind so far as irrigation was concerned.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sir Cotton did seem to reserve his venom for the British obsession with railways. When asked if all of the British administration was at fault for dreading cheap transit, he replied with a concise ‘Yes’. “I only say what are facts,” he added.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Do you really mean to say that you think that for the last twenty years every Viceroy and every official con­nected with the Public Works Department and the Council of India generally, and all the Secretaries of State, have been actuated by, as you put it, the dread of cheap transit? ”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I only say what are facts. I ask, Have you <em>finished </em>anything irrigationally? It is not what I say. These are facts,”</p>\n<p>Mr. Sampson Lloyd was much puzzled at these state­ments ; he could not believe what he had heard. “Why should any man dread cheap transit ? ”</p>\n<p>Readily came the reply: “Because it would stultify the railways; that is the sole point”</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s not tough to understand why that meeting worked against his favour, and why more funds weren’t granted for irrigational purposes.</p>\n<p>In his later years, he retired in England and spent much of the time focussing on new elements: Earth and air.</p>\n<p>He experimented with various combinations and conditions in order to increase crop and soil productivity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It was a great enjoyment to him to lay out the gardens of our new house at Dorking, trenching them after his own fashion, three feet deep, and at the same time manuring highly ; afterwards he considered it a mistake to do this on too rich a scale. He took immense pains with the production of both flowers and vegetables ; his efforts were rewarded with remarkable success.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>He converted his garden into different soil plots and sowed wheat, potatoes, rye etc. At the age of 84, he realised that farming techniques required radical change and set out to figure out what they were. His conclusion was aeration – that soil needed to be treated with air by breaking the clumpy nature of soil when ploughing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“it weighed, so that he might know exactly what the produce would amount to per acre. By degrees he in­terested himself intensely in agriculture, experimenting on wheat, oats<sub>`</sub> and Indian corn. He found that he could produce seven times the ordinary result from one grain of wheat. In the “Appendix” to this chapter will be found a description of his working out of this problem. He would aerate the ground two or three feet deep, pulverising the soil, his theory being that plants needed air as much as water.”</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>And the secret ? Aeration—simply a fuller and deeper aeration of the soil. Instead of ploughing six inches only, and with the old style, clod-making plough, Lord Tweeddale had ploughed (with four horses) to a depth of sixteen inches with a plough that <em>made </em><em>n</em><em>o clods.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>But before he could finish his experiments, he passed away at the age of 96, reciting prayers from the Bible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“my mother again writes :-</p>\n<p>On the night of the 14th July he was feverish and restless, and it may have been that he became aware then how ill he was. He poured out a remarkable prayer—pleading God’s promises, and committing himself and those he loved to the gracious Promiser in a way – never to be forgotten ; the remembrance is full of comfort to..”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In his last days, he took a keen interest in the situation at Transvaal, the wars being fought in the Empire and Russia’s relationship with China. But nothing captures the man as perfectly as knowing that his last written printed words to the general public were condemning the British government for giving India “more iron than water”.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It is interesting to note that my father’s last communica­tions to the Press were in the form of letters to <em>The Times. </em>concerning famines in India. The final words which, for public purposes, came from his pen, were in condemnation of ” giving India iron instead of water.” ” This,” he de­clared, ” was the sole cause of all this awful loss of millions of lives and hundreds of millions of money in the value of crops and cattle.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course there’s more to be discovered about the man and given the times, it’s never wise to deify any figure. As our understanding of eco-systems has increased over the years, the idea of river-interlinking projects has come under controversy. Sir Cotton is not the first person to work intensely to construct irrigational facilities that tamed India’s rivers and helped manage its moody monsoons. The Raya dynasty had worked hard to construct percolated tanks with the help of Portuguese travelers. The southern part of Andhra Pradesh is named after the dynasty and many myths are woven around the dynasty’s magnanimity. But that people dig into medieval histories for public policy solutions is a reflection of the state of affairs in the region.</p>\n<p>What is striking about Sir Cotton’s journey seems to be the sheer perseverance against the administrative machinery, 40 years of continued service and going against the popular tide that many of his countrymen followed. Even though ‘The Great Indian Railways’ are a romanticised part of the Indian identity, his case against it and his imagination of an India that travels through its waters (not necessarily substituting trains, but complimenting them) does open up a can of ‘what-ifs’.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/mukesh-manjunath/\" title=\"Mukesh Manjunath\" target=\"_blank\">Mukesh Manjunath</a> graduated with a masters in development studies from IIT-Madras, Chennai.

For a long time Trump had been claiming that the <span>US</span> is being taken for a ride by <span>China</span> and we may now be at the cusp of a major change <span>in</span> <span>US</span>–<span>China</span> <span>relations</span> as the Americans being to implement punitive trade measures against Beijing.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/206720/trumps-new-national-security-strategy-india/\" title=\"What Trump’s New National Security Strategy Means For India\" target=\"_blank\">What Trump’s New National Security Strategy Means For India</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">6. </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The post-Tiananmen CPC was led largely by engineers and technocrats who had become politicians like Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao.

Their aim is to have all the AI revolution under the command of the CPC. <span>China</span> has huge data sets and few privacy controls, further, this data is being used for maintaining social control <span>in</span> a society that is already under authoritarian rule.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">7. </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Ever since Xi has taken over, <span>China</span> has been more assertively pushing its foreign goals. <span>China</span> is already a major economic power across the globe. <span>It</span> now wants its military also to catch up <span>with</span> the kind of economic clout <span>it</span> has. <span>China</span> is inexperienced and somewhat gauche <span>in</span> the exercise of global power.

All these fake encounters were done on the direct orders of the superior officers.” These are the opening lines of the affidavit that Thounaojam Herojit Singh – Manipur’s self-confessed killer cop – filed in the Supreme Court on Monday.</p>\n<p>Herojit was a head constable with the Manipur police and in the period of 2003 to 2009, he says he witnessed – and carried out – extra judicial killings in the state. He also says he kept a written record of those killings.</p>\n<p>“I maintained in my own hand 3-4 diaries of these fake encounters in which I made entries serial-wise of (i) the name of the victim (ii) his age (iii) parentage (iv) address (v) place of occurrence (vi) date of the killing or arrest (vii) remarks such as “killed” or “done” or “arrest” and; (viii) the call sign code of the superior officer who gave the order to kill,” says his affidavit.</p>\n<p>But Herojit says these diaries were taken from him during a raid by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2010. He says this was done in front of his family, after which the CBI repeatedly called him in for questioning about the details in his diaries.</p>\n<p>Herojit came from Manipur to the Supreme Court to tell the judges: “I believe that the CBI will destroy or suppress these diaries.”</p>\n<p>He wants the court to direct the CBI to produce those diaries before it.</p>\n<p>Herojit’s affidavit comes as an intervention in the ongoing public interest litigation regarding 1528 cases of alleged fake encounters in Manipur. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/50110/army-excessive-force-afspa-sc-manipur/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://thewire.in/50110/army-excessive-force-afspa-sc-manipur/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515521769455000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFR83AtXGRKcIusvKLCBLjat23gcA\" title=\"On July 8, 2016\" target=\"_blank\">On July 8, 2016</a>, the Supreme Court passed a landmark order which said that Indian army and paramilitary personnel cannot use “excessive and retaliatory” force in Manipur.

The ongoing litigation challenges this.</p>\n<p><b>Herojit’s diaries and the paper trail of Manipur’s fake encounters</b></p>\n<p>In court on Monday, Herojit sat quietly at the back while military personnel, both in uniform and in plain clothes, sat a few rows ahead of him.</p>\n<p>While Manipur has seen 1528 cases of alleged fake encounters, none of these has resulted in any punishment.</p>\n<p>Herojit’s story, which he has now spoken about in at least three <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211424/beyond-bhima-koregaon-tale-dalit-maratha-relations-modern-maharashtra/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/confessions-of-a-killer-policeman-india-manipur&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515521769455000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwUh_xUUv9fO8gFBjXW2Jw7qj7Qg\" title=\"media interviews\" target=\"_blank\">media interviews</a>, is a departure from the code of silence regarding violent crimes committed by security forces in India’s “disturbed areas.”</p>\n<p>With only victims and no perpetrators, the Extra-Judicial Execution Victim Families Association (EEVFAM) has been trying to gather documents on the 1528 cases, which they then submitted to the Supreme Court. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/126299/manipur-fake-encounters-afspa-army/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://thewire.in/126299/manipur-fake-encounters-afspa-army/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515521769455000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSikebzuP7PM58-HBwnjGTOvk-Uw\" title=\"The Wire reported on this\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Wire</em> reported on this</a> documentation project last year.</p>\n<p>Herojit’s diaries, if submitted by the CBI, could add to the reams of documents collected by the petitioners, for further investigation.</p>\n<p>His prayers to the court were that the CBI be directed to produce these diaries, and that they subsequently be kept in the safe custody of the court. He also said that he has been wanting to record his testimony before the CBI, but “it appears that the CBI is interested in hushing up the whole matter.”</p>\n<p><b>Supreme Court pulls up government</b></p>\n<p>On Monday, the bench of Justices Madan B. Lokur and U.U. Lalit did not pass any fresh order on Herojit’s affidavit but pulled up the government for not complying with last year’s direction to file FIRs and chargesheets on a shortlist of 92 cases by December 31, 2017.</p>\n<p>The government failed to do so, and has in fact only filed 11 FIRs. Nor has it proceeded with any investigations and chargesheets.</p>\n<p>“It appears the matter is not being taken up by the CBI and the special investigation team with the seriousness it deserves,” Justice Lokur said.</p>\n<p>“Only 11 FIRs have been filed by the government, over seven months. This means that the 92 cases will only have FIRs in four and a half years,” said Menaka Guruswamy, <em>amicus curiae</em>, to the judges. “This is supposed to be a time bound, court monitored investigation. I submit, that the special investigation team (SIT) is dragging its feet,” she said.</p>\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dIl8mtnx25s?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" width=\"1160\" type=\"text/html\" height=\"683\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The judges said in their order that the government has not complied with the Supreme Court, “inspite of the fact that the CBI moved an application before us to increase the strength of the SIT. That request was approved by us.”</p>\n<p>The judges also repeatedly asked the government’s counsel why their performance on the investigation has been so lax, and why they had not bothered to bring a member of the SIT to court to explain this. The bench directed the government to file a status report on the investigation and bring a member of the SIT in the next hearing.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211905/cbi-will-destroy-diaries-alleges-manipurs-killer-cop-record-killings/\">CBI Will Destroy My Diaries, Alleges Manipur’s ‘Killer Cop’ on His Record of Killings</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo</p></div>\n<p><b>New Delhi</b>: The Supreme Court today stayed the Karnataka high court order quashing the 2014 government regulation that packets of tobacco products must carry pictorial warning covering 85% of the packaging space, saying that “health of a citizen has primacy”.</p>\n<p>A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud was “unimpressed” with the submissions of the Tobacco Institute of India (TII) that the interim stay would harm the fundamental right to do business of tobacco manufacturers.</p>\n<p>“Considering the …submission advanced at the Bar and keeping in view the objects and reasons of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 and the measures taken by the state, we think it appropriate to direct stay of operation of the judgment and order passed by the high court of Karnataka,” the bench said.</p>\n<p>Rejecting the submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for tobacco manufacturers, that it would affect their business, it said, “We have remained unimpressed by the said proponent as we are inclined to think that health of a citizen has primacy and he or she should be aware of that which can affect or deteriorate the condition of health.</p>\n<p>“We may hasten to add that deterioration may be a milder word and, therefore, in all possibility the expression ‘destruction of health’ is apposite.”</p>\n<p>The bench then posted the appeals filed by NGO Health for Millions Trust and Umesh Narain for final hearing on March 12 and asked the parties to complete pleading in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Attorney General K.K. Venugopal and Advocate R. Balasubramanian, appearing for the Centre, said that the high court judgment needed to be stayed and 85% pictorial warning on packaging space of tobacco products be allowed to remain as a large section of the population is not educated.</p>\n<p>Life sans health is not worth living and chewing of tobacco or smoking of cigarettes or <em>bidis</em>, causes irretrievable hazard to health.</p>\n<p>It is the obligation of the state to make the people aware of the injurious nature of these indulgences, Venugopal said.</p>\n<p>Initially one may start with smoking or chewing tobacco as an “adventure, but gradually it becomes a habit and, thereafter, it gets converted to addiction. That addiction becomes the killing factor or causation of pain, suffering, agony, anguish and ultimately death,” he said.</p>\n<p>“So far as tobacco is concerned, this is the most dangerous thing as it causes cancers and heart diseases,” Venugopal said.</p>\n<p>If the high court order of pictorial warning covering 40% of packaging space of tobacco products is allowed to operate than India will be pushed to 147th rank after Zimbabwe which mandated more prominent display of such pictorial warnings, the Attorney General said.</p>\n<p>Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for TII, said that even a parliamentary panel had suggested that there should pictorial warning covering 40 per cent of the packaging space of tobacco products and urged the court that it let the high court order remain in force till March 31 and list the matter for final hearing.</p>\n<p>Sibal also suggested that the court may consider it capping at 50 per cent.</p>\n<p>The high court, on December 15, last year had struck down the 2014 amendment rules that mandated pictorial health warnings to cover 85% of packaging space of tobacco products, holding that they were unconstitutional as they violated fundamental rights like the right to equality and the right to trade.</p>\n<p>The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Amendment Rules, 2014 (COTPA) had come into effect from April 1, 2016.</p>\n<p>It came into being based on the recommendations of experts committee, the NGO had said.</p>\n<p>The bench was hearing appeals including those filed by NGO Health for Millions Trust and Umesh Narain, a senior advocate, against the high court verdict.</p>\n<p>The high court had, however, made it clear that the 40% pictorial health warning rule, which existed prior to the amendment rules, would remain in force.</p>\n<p>In May last year, the Supreme Court had transferred all petitions against the 85% rule filed in various high courts to the Karnataka high court and asked it to hear and dispose them of.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211893/sc-stays-karnataka-hc-verdict-against-85-pictorial-warning-on-tobacco-products/\">SC Stays Karnataka HC Verdict Against 85% Pictorial Warning on Tobacco Products</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>In a dramatic change of stand, the Centre on January 8 suggested that the Supreme Court modify its earlier order making it mandatory for cinema halls to play the national anthem before screening a feature film.</p>\n<p>It said an inter-ministerial committee has been set up to frame guidelines describing circumstances and occasions on which the national anthem is to be played or sung.</p>\n<p>The government said the top court may “consider the restoration of status quo ante until then i.e restoration of the position as it stood before the order passed by this court on November 30, 2016”.</p>\n<p>The government said that the inter-ministerial committee will be headed by Additional Secretary (Border Management), Ministry of Home Affairs, with representatives from various other ministries, including the Ministries of Defence, External Affairs, Culture, Woman and Child Development and Parliamentary Affairs.</p>\n<p>It would also have representatives of Ministries of Information and Broadcasting and Minority Affairs, Department of Legal Affairs, Department of School Education and Literacy and the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disability, the affidavit filed by Centre said.</p>\n<p>It said the committee would have to consider a wide range of issues relating to the national anthem, and have extensive discussions with various ministries. The committee will then give its recommendations in six months from the date of its constitution.</p>\n<p>The Centre, in its four-page affidavit, said upon consideration of the recommendation made by the panel, the government may bring out the requisite notification or circular or rules in this regard, if required.</p>\n<p>During the hearing of a PIL on October 23, Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, had said India was a diverse country and the national anthem needed to be played in cinema halls to bring in uniformity.</p>\n<p>He had said it should be left open to the government to take a call on whether the anthem should be played in theatres and whether people should stand up for it.</p>\n<p>The apex court had then observed that people do not need to stand up in the cinema halls to prove their patriotism and asked the Centre to consider amending the rules.</p>\n<p>It had observed that it cannot be assumed that if a person does not stand up for the national anthem, he is “less patriotic” and the people “cannot be forced to carry patriotism on their sleeves”.</p>\n<p>The court’s strong remarks had come during the hearing on a PIL filed last year by Shyam Narayan Chouksey seeking a direction that the national anthem be played in all cinema halls before the start of screening of a film.</p>\n<p>The apex court had in its November 30, 2016, order said that “love and respect for the motherland is reflected when one shows respect to the national anthem as well as to the national flag”.</p>\n<p>It had also barred printing of the anthem or a part of it on any object and displaying it in such a manner at places which may be “disgraceful to its status and tantamount to disrespect”.</p>\n<p>§</p>\n<p><em>Read the text of the Centre’s affidavit below:</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/368682786/Union-s-Affidavit-in-Chouksey-Matter#from_embed\" title=\"Union's Affidavit in Chouksey Matter\" target=\"_blank\">Union’s Affidavit in Chouksey Matter</a> by <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/user/286754081/The-Wire#from_embed\" title=\"The Wire\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a> on Scribd</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/368682786/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-IFdFSZ7uEuzzb07kHdVM&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" width=\"600\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.6992248062015504\" title=\"Union's Affidavit in Chouksey Matter\" height=\"800\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211889/centre-urges-sc-modify-order-mandatory-playing-national-anthem-movie-halls/\">Centre Urges SC to Modify Order on Mandatory Playing of National Anthem in Cinema Halls</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

The attacks on Muslims and Dalits have been increasing. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government has done nothing to stop its own leaders from perpetuating hate across the country. At the same time, the government has miserably failed to economically uplift any community. The government is nowhere close to generating two crore jobs every year as it had promised. Constant price rise has broken people. The rally in Delhi will address these concerns,” said Nakul Singh Sawhney, documentary filmmaker, and one of the organisers of the rally.</p>\n<p>While most such spontaneous rallies have evolved from caste-based mobilisations, the January 9 event, the organisers say, will try and highlight the economic concerns of a large mass of people apart from addressing issues of social justice.</p>\n<p>“Across the Hindi-belt, an environment of hate is being encouraged by the Sangh <em>parivar. </em>Chandrasekhar Azad and <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/181523/assam-farmers-rights-activist-akhil-gogoi-arrested-under-national-security-act/\" title=\"Akhil Gogoi are facing the draconian National Security Act\" target=\"_blank\">Akhil Gogoi are facing the draconian National Security Act</a>, Jignesh <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/elections/gujarat-assembly-elections-2017/accused-of-terror-link-fund-jignesh-mevani-threatens-to-sue-bjp-4975838/\" title=\"Mevani is being portrayed as a terrorist\" target=\"_blank\">Mevani is being portrayed as a terrorist</a> by the right wing. The events of the last three years clearly suggest that anyone who is speaking against communalism, casteism, or poverty ends up being targeted by the Modi government,” said Sawhney, adding that the rally will mark the beginning of an independent opposition and will be led by different young leaders from India.</p>\n<p>“We will not only talk about Dalits and Muslims. We will also talk about issues of transport workers, <em>anganwadi</em> workers, tea plantation workers and school teachers. We will try to consolidate the opposition forces on the ground so that our movement articulates the most pertinent concerns of the people,” said Sawhney.</p>\n<p>Nadeem Khan, one of the organisers and a leader from the United Against Hate campaign, said, “If anyone wants to support us, they are welcome as long as they do not try to appropriate the movement as their own. We want the movement to evolve in a truly democratic spirit.”</p>\n<p>He added, “Look, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/153717/najeeb-ahmed-jnu-disasspearances/\" title=\"Najeeb Ahmed disappeared\" target=\"_blank\">Najeeb Ahmed disappeared</a> 15 months ago and the government seems to have forgotten him despite so many people raising the issue.

Today, if a Muslim with a cap leaves his home in Deoband or Saharanpur for Delhi, he is scared of reaching Delhi safe. Such is the environment.

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>Khan said that after tomorrow’s rally, several teams will be constituted which will start campaigning in the Hindi-belt, especially in Uttar Pradesh and poll-bound Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.</p>\n<p>Khalid Saifi, another organiser, said: “We felt the need of some sort of people-oriented politics which will raise social and economic issues. The mainstream political parties, I don’t think, understand or articulate the problems and concerns of the Indian youth. We will do that. Tomorrow will be the beginning of that process. The Modi government came to power with the support of the youth and they are the ones who feel the most betrayed after three years of his rule.”</p>\n<p>The organisers claim that they have been holding corner meetings at various places across north India and they expect those people to turn up for the rally, in which around 25 organisations will participate.</p>\n<p>“We will engage with all civil society organisations except those who are either directly or indirectly affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,” said Saifi.</p>\n<p>Pradeep Narwal, a JNU student and a member of Dalit Morcha, said, “Being a Dalit, I know how atrocities against Dalits have increased under this government. In Haryana, many of them still await justice from the government. Two days ago, I went to Mumbai to speak at a meeting but the police arrested both me and Richa Singh, the UP-based student leader. The government has left no room for any form of criticism. The youth feel agitated and tomorrow’s rally will begin an organised process to consolidate the anger on the ground. After tomorrow, I will start campaigning in Haryana on issues of Dalit dignity and employment.”</p>\n<p>Asked how such a movement will balance economic concerns and caste-based identity politics together, Narwal said, “Right now, we understand that the rising agitations across the country reflect poorly on government’s policies and its approach on different social issues. Our idea is to connect to the youth. The immediate contradiction between the oppressed and oppressor is felt in a more caste-based way in Indian villages. But the way this government has functioned in the last few years, we feel that it will not be the same. Economic conditions of people across caste groups will dominate the agitations against the government. That is why the dominant Patidars and Dalits came together in Gujarat. In our effort to seek systematic transformational change, we want to consolidate that sentiment on the ground.”</p>\n<p>However, when asked whether they wanted to contest elections, they said that they are not looking to fight elections at the moment but to bring different people’s movements under one umbrella. “We do not want any formal alliances with the opposition parties but are willing to welcome their support on issues they raise. Jignesh Mevani won as an independent with the support of various parties. We can possibly look for such opportunities in future. It is a long road ahead.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211875/youth-rally-delhi-mark-new-beginning-opposition-politics/\">Youth Rally in Delhi Could Mark a New Beginning for Opposition Politics</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

The violence follows a long and complicated history of their camaraderie as well as the antagonism between them, which often revealed the social and political turbulence of the time. The terms of the relationship between the two communities are not directed solely on the basis of caste; they are also defined by the roles these communities play on the ground. Numerically, Marathas are dominant in the state. They are a landed community and enjoy significant monopoly over key political offices. Compared to them, Dalits are less in number, but have a significant population dispersed across Maharashtra. After the arrival of the Ambedkarite alternative, Dalits, particularly Mahars, have consistently posed a challenge to Maratha hegemony by explicitly rejecting stigmatised traditional village-based duties. Since then, tension between the Mahars – who have converted to Buddhism – and the Marathas has actively grown, leading to volatility in the state.</p>\n<p>For the last decade or two, the terms of caste antagonism between the two communities have fundamentally changed. Hindutva groups are using the pretext of hostility to increasingly radicalise the Marathas to counter Dalits. The Marathas have been witnessing a significant decline in their social and political stature since the late 1990s. The cause of this is primarily the loss of political monopoly in recent years. Before the 1990s, anti-Dalit violence perpetrated by the Marathas was a crude assertion of caste superiority. On the other hand, anti-Dalit violence in contemporary times is packaged with Hindutva ideology, which seeks to push the society back into primitive darkness. The invocation of past Maratha glory is strategically used to fuel social tensions between the two communities. Maratha youth, who are facing unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities, are easily pulled into this conflict.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/210755/bhima-koregaon-dalits-never-ending-search-nation/\" title=\"Bhima Koregaon and the Dalits’ Never-Ending Search for a Nation\" target=\"_blank\">Bhima Koregaon and the Dalits’ Never-Ending Search for a Nation</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Non-Brahmin politics and the invocation of Shivaji </strong></p>\n<p>The history of the Dalit-Maratha relationship is, however, not confined to hostility and antagonism as is often showcased. Like the Marathas, Dalit castes like Mahars, Matangs and Chambhars were important constituents of the village community. Like the Marathas, Dalits too traditionally celebrate Chhatrapati Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, though focusing primarily on his progressive and inclusive role as a state administrator. He is also remembered by Dalits as one who nurtured an unprejudiced attitude towards the lower sections of society. In the last 100 years, the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/9040/the-politics-of-shivaji-caste-and-history-writing/\" title=\"history of Shivaji\" target=\"_blank\">history of Shivaji</a> has been communalised by popular writers and leaders in Maharashtra. But Dalits here identify him as their inspiration and a ruler who ruptured the caste hierarchy. Moreover, the iconic stature of Shivaji has been one of the significant factors that helped collectively mobilise Dalits, lower castes and Marathas on several occasions. Mass movements like the non-Brahmin movement, which sought to bring together different caste groups such as Marathas, Dalits and other lower castes, have frequently used Shivaji’s iconic personality to sustain the unity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161003/Mahatma_Phule.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161003/Mahatma_Phule.jpg?fit=153%2C206\" data-orig-size=\"153,206\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161003/Mahatma_Phule.jpg?fit=153%2C206\" data-attachment-id=\"211775\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161003/Mahatma_Phule.jpg?resize=183%2C246&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211424/beyond-bhima-koregaon-tale-dalit-maratha-relations-modern-maharashtra/mahatma_phule/\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161003/Mahatma_Phule.jpg?fit=153%2C206\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"Mahatma_Phule\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211775\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jyotiba Phule. Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>In modern times, it was Jyotiba Phule who was the first to make Shivaji’s socially and politically relevant. Phule saw him as one of the most prominent Shudra-friendly rulers of India. He wrote a <em>powada</em> (ballad) on Shivaji, depicting him as a ruler who actively promoted social integration. Phule also portrayed Shivaji as an egalitarian ruler who never discriminated on the basis of caste and religion; he was described as the pride of peasants and the toiling masses, with Phule fondly calling him <em>Kulvadibhushan</em>. In his writings, Phule asked the Marathas to follow Shivaji’s profound sense of equality and justice. Phule’s Shivaji was one of the first significant efforts to situate dominant Marathas into the nascent non-Brahmin discourse. It was also an attempt to creatively construct a history by using prominent symbolism available to society. After Phule’s death, non-Brahmin and Dalit leaders like Narayan Meghaji Lokhande, Vitthal Ramji Shinde, Chatrapati Shahu, B.R. Ambedkar and Nanasingh Patil employed Shivaji’s symbolism to mobilise the masses. In fact, in the 1920s, Ambedkar’s letterhead depicted Shivaji’s sword (Bhavani <em>talwar</em>), which also reflects the all-encompassing image of Shivaji.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there has been a concerted attempt by the right-wing to paint Shivaji and Maratha history with communal colours, including an evident upper-caste slant. Right-wing historical narratives are often situated within anti-Muslim and upper caste-centric discourses, thus complicating the social and political fabric of Maharashtra. With active government support since the inception of the state, these histories have dominated historical discourse in Maharashtra. As a result, it has become easy to appropriate Shivaji and Maratha history into the Hindutva fold. This appropriation started a long time ago; it predates the rise of the political right-wing in the state.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08162119/shivaji.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08162119/shivaji.jpg?fit=452%2C353\" data-orig-size=\"452,353\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08162119/shivaji.jpg?fit=300%2C234\" data-attachment-id=\"211787\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08162119/shivaji.jpg?resize=548%2C428&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211424/beyond-bhima-koregaon-tale-dalit-maratha-relations-modern-maharashtra/shivaji/\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08162119/shivaji.jpg?fit=452%2C353\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"shivaji\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211787\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shivaji in battle.

Under Phule’s leadership, efforts to bring the oppressed caste groups together was largely contingent on the participation of Dalits and Marathas. The reason for the phenomenal success of the Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Phule, was that it was followed and supported by large number of Marathas, Malis and Dalits. Phule was partially successful in establishing ‘non-Brahmin’ as an important category to reckon with. While defining this, he had famously argued that non-Brahmin society was defined by its distinct culture and history. However, the argument regarding socio-cultural unity could not sustain non-Brahmin prospects in politics for long, as it was filled with inherent contradictions. One of the factors that led to the decline of the non-Brahmin voice was the inability of dominant castes to overcome internal social and political differences. Since the 1920s, Dalits began to assert themselves separately as a powerful and organised group. From the beginning of his public life, Ambedkar was not very keen to associate himself with non-Brahmin politics. He believed that the non-Brahmin identity, despite being an important instrument of social change, was not capable of tackling the question of caste discrimination. Additionally, the involvement of Marathas and other dominant non-Brahmin castes in the perpetration of violence against Dalits resulted in the intensification of hostility. Reports of violence against Dalits increased phenomenally when Dalits began to actively organise and assert themselves against the dominant Maratha supremacy in the villages.</p>\n<p>After Phule’s death, the Satyashodhak-led anti-Brahminical assertion transformed into a credible political movement under Chhatrapati Shahu’s leadership. During this period many Maratha leaders emerged, and they actively allied with Dalits to advance the fight against untouchability. They were instrumental in establishing strong institutions that helped foregrounding the assertive and organised Dalit movement. Vitthal Ramji Shinde, a Maratha social reformer, was one such example. He was one of the most important Dalit leaders before the arrival of Ambedkar, and aggressively spoke on behalf of Dalits. Despite his serious differences with Ambedkar, the schools and hostels started by him became prominent hubs of the Ambedkarite Dalit movement. Many prominent Dalit leaders emerged from his institutions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161519/220px-ShahuIV_1874-1922.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161519/220px-ShahuIV_1874-1922.jpg?fit=215%2C265\" data-orig-size=\"215,265\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161519/220px-ShahuIV_1874-1922.jpg?fit=215%2C265\" data-attachment-id=\"211778\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161519/220px-ShahuIV_1874-1922.jpg?resize=215%2C265&ssl=1\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/211424/beyond-bhima-koregaon-tale-dalit-maratha-relations-modern-maharashtra/220px-shahuiv_1874-1922/\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/thewire-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08161519/220px-ShahuIV_1874-1922.jpg?fit=215%2C265\" alt=\"\" data-image-title=\"220px-ShahuIV_1874-1922\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-211778\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chhatrapati Shahu. Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>On the other hand, Shahu, the ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur and one of the most charismatic Maratha leaders, shaped the course of Dalit politics in the early 20th century. He was able to bring together a range of leaders from disparate caste groups and provided a strong push to the cause of assertive non-Brahmin politics. He also enthusiastically supported Ambedkar and was instrumental in helping fund his education abroad. The first major public meeting that Ambedkar ever addressed was attended by Shahu. His untimely death created an enormous vacuum within the Maratha and non-Brahmin leadership, which eventually led to the decline of non-Brahmin politics in Maharashtra. He was replaced by two prominent leaders from western India, Keshavrao Jedhe and Dinkarrao Jawalkar. They actively supported Ambedkar in the 1920s and 1930s, but eventually chose to join the Congress. They were instrumental in decimating the upper-caste leadership within the Congress, paving the way for Maratha-oriented leadership at a provincial level. From then onwards, Marathas began to politically dominate the Marathi-speaking landscape of western India.</p>\n<p>Dalits enthusiastically sought the help of progressive Marathas and actively appropriated them in the anti-caste movement. Simultaneously, Ambedkar was able to attract activists and leaders from different caste groups in his organisations. The peasant organisation led by Ambedkar in the Konkan region, particularly in the decade of the 1930s, was led by his prominent non-Dalit colleagues; one of them was Narayanrao Patil, a Maratha. Patil played a crucial role in shaping the thumping electoral victory in the 1937 elections for the Independent Labour Party, Ambedkar’s first political party, particularly in the Konkan region. On the other hand, the Vidarbha region also produced significant Maratha leaders who actively aligned with Dalits. One of them was Punjabrao Deshmukh, the first agriculture minister of India, who started his public life as a radical social activist and an active organiser of the anti-caste movement. Before switching allegiance to the Congress, he served as a member of the provincial legislature of Central Provinces and Berar, representing the Independent Labour Party.  He remained Ambedkar’s trusted colleague for a long time.</p>\n<p>Despite active efforts to bridge differences between the Marathas and Dalits, the top non-Brahmin leadership was unable to prevent large-scale anti-Dalit violence in the rural hinterlands of Maharashtra. Reports between the 1920s and 1947 clearly suggest that anti-Dalit violence erupted when Dalits actively resisted the dominant hegemony. Dalit resistance during this period was reinforced by the presence of a strong assertive Dalit movement under Ambedkar’s leadership. In fact, anti-Dalit violence played a crucial role in shaping organised Dalit politics. As a result, Maratha-Dalit relations at the village level remained fundamentally unchanged for several decades.</p>\n<p><strong>Dalit-Maratha relations in post-independence India</strong></p>\n<p>In the post-independence period, the relationship underwent significant changes. The demographic majority attained by the Marathas in the newly-created state of Maharashtra and their unchecked political monopoly over state affairs tilted the balance of power in their favour. Being a landed community, the majority of Marathas continued to work on the land and in agriculture, and they aggressively controlled the rural regions of Maharashtra. This led to a constant tussle between the Marathas and Dalits. The long-term volatile situation eventually led to the explosion of radical voices in the 1970s in the form of the Dalit Panthers.</p>\n<p>The case of caste violence perpetrated by the Marathas at Bavda village triggered the formation of the Dalit Panthers in 1972. The primary focus of this organisation was ending caste violence against Dalits. Though short-lived, the Dalit Panthers emerged as a formidable voice of aggressive Dalit youth.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211316/will-prakash-ambedkar-take-lead-fight-dalit-rights-maharashtra/\" title=\"Will Prakash Ambedkar Take the Lead in the Fight for Dalit Rights in Maharashtra?\" target=\"_blank\">Will Prakash Ambedkar Take the Lead in the Fight for Dalit Rights in Maharashtra?</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>Meanwhile, Maratha monopoly over the social and political landscape of Maharashtra continued until the 1990s. The decade of the 1990s witnessed important changes which deeply affected Maratha supremacy. The implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations, the introduction of the New Economic Reforms and the enactment of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act collectively led to the decline of Maratha supremacy. As a result, they witnessed a substantial decline in their social and political stature. This decline became palpable only in the 2000s. Simultaneously, it was in the 1990s and 2000s that Hindutva organisations began to expand their organisational network. In the last few years, they have grown primarily due to the large-scale participation of disgruntled Marathas from rural areas. These organisations have been polarising the political landscape on religious and caste lines, particularly against Ambedkarite Dalits who are largely identified as a major impediment to their political project. Consequently, a substantial section of the Marathas and other dominant middle castes, particularly from rural regions, have been getting increasingly attracted to these organisations, thereby creating the possibility of perpetual social tension.</p>\n<p>The incident that took place at Bhima Koregaon was not an isolated one. Cases of caste violence and atrocities against Dalits have become habitual since time immemorial. They demonstrate the intimate relationship between caste and violence. When Dalits challenge dominant society, they are often castigated and targeted by the political establishment. In modern times, this phenomenon has been frequently repeated, particularly after the inception of an assertive Dalit movement under Ambedkar’s leadership. Ambedkar was regularly mocked as anti-national and sectarian by the Congress leadership during his lifetime. In post-Ambedkar Maharashtra, Dalits who challenged the dominant notions of society were conveniently marginalised by political elites. Caste violence has been a part of Maharashtra’s culture for a long time. Hindutva ideology did not develop overnight; it was actively aided and patronised by the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party for many decades. On the other hand, history textbooks taught in the schools of Maharashtra reflect this clandestine alliance between the two; an alliance that has collectively led to the communalisation of intellectual discourse.</p>\n<p>The Bhima Koregaon violence is significant primarily because it illustrates the new strategy used by dominant castes against Dalits. There is a significant difference between the anti-Dalit violence of the 1980s and 2018. The violence perpetrated by the dominant castes in the 1980s was a localised affair; on the other hand, violence at Bhima Koregaon was not. It was not a spontaneous reaction as has been claimed. It was carefully managed and strategised from a distance. The friction between the Marathas and Dalits, which began at Vadhu Budruk, was carefully used to instigate violence at Bhima Koregaon. The rage of crisis-ridden Marathas was deliberately directed to disturb social harmony. Maratha history is continuously invoked to attract disgruntled Marathas. If this trend continues, it will provide a template for greater social conflicts between different communities that could lead to a breakdown of dialogue. More than any other community, such conflicts will significantly impact Dalits.</p>\n<p><em><span>Prabodhan Pol teaches history at Ramjas College, University of Delhi.</span></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211424/beyond-bhima-koregaon-tale-dalit-maratha-relations-modern-maharashtra/\">Beyond Bhima Koregaon: A Tale of Dalit-Maratha Relations in Modern Maharashtra</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

But a political economy perspective emphasises that social relations abhor a power vacuum. When state authority contracts, private parties fill the gap. That power can feel just as oppressive, and have effects just as pervasive, as garden variety administrative agency enforcement of civil law. As Robert Lee Hale <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=pVyxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=%E2%80%9CThere+is+government+whenever+one+person+or+group+can+tell+others+what+they+must+do+and+when+those+others+have+to+obey+or+suffer+a+penalty.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=lju7lKxAjZ&sig=ZzZgKcuyYWU7nPY0B1LNZIIhIeY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mNqE4OvXAhWGSN8KHTg3At8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20government%20whenever%20one%20person%20or%20group%20can%20tell%20others%20what%20they%20must%20do%20and%20when%20those%20others%20have%20to%20obey%20or%20suffer%20a%20penalty.%E2%80%9D&f=false\" title=\"stated\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a>, “There is government whenever one person or group can tell others what they must do and when those others have to obey or suffer a penalty.”</p>\n<p>We are familiar with that power in <a href=\"http://iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2017_Fall_Pasquale.php\" title=\"employer-employee relationships\" target=\"_blank\">employer-employee relationships</a>, or when a massive firm extracts concessions from suppliers. But what about when a firm presumes to exercise <em>juridical </em>power, not as a party to a conflict, but the authority deciding it? I worry that such scenarios will become all the more common as <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/frank-pasquale-will-amazon-take-over-world\" title=\"massive digital platforms\" target=\"_blank\">massive digital platforms</a> exercise more power over our commercial lives.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, the <a href=\"http://www.fesdc.org/about/friedrich-ebert-stiftung/\" title=\"Friedrich Ebert Stiftung\" target=\"_blank\">Friedrich Ebert Stiftung</a> (a think tank affiliated with the Social Democratic Party in Germany) invited me to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzOTuQ1sJbc\" title=\"speak\" target=\"_blank\">speak</a> at their <a href=\"http://www.fes.de/de/digitalcapitalism/\" title=\"Conference on Digital Capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">Conference on Digital Capitalism</a>.

They are no longer market participants. Rather, in their fields, they are market makers, able to exert regulatory control over the terms on which others can sell goods and services. Moreover, they aspire to displace more government roles over time, replacing the logic of territorial sovereignty with functional sovereignty. In functional arenas from room-letting to transportation to commerce, persons will be increasingly subject to corporate rather than democratic control.</p>\n<p>For example: Who needs city housing regulators when AirBnB can use data-driven methods to effectively regulate room-letting, then house-letting and eventually <a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3062246/an-exclusive-look-at-airbnbs-first-foray-into-urban-planning\" title=\"urban planning\" target=\"_blank\">urban planning</a> generally? Why not let Amazon have its own <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/19/georgia-mayor-wants-amazons-second-headquarters-in-town-named-amazon.html\" title=\"jurisdiction\" target=\"_blank\">jurisdiction</a> or <a href=\"https://concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/07/in-the-venal-colony.html\" title=\"charter city\" target=\"_blank\">charter city</a> or establish <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-foxconn-wisconsin-law-20170920-story.html\" title=\"special judicial procedures for Foxconn\" target=\"_blank\">special judicial procedures for Foxconn</a>? Some vanguardists of functional sovereignty believe online rating systems could replace state <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2881732\" title=\"occupational licensure\" target=\"_blank\">occupational licensure</a> – so rather than having government boards credential workers, a platform like LinkedIn could collect star ratings on them.</p>\n<p>In this and later posts, I want to explain how this shift from territorial to functional sovereignty is creating a new digital political economy. Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/opinion/amazon-whole-foods-jeff-bezos.html\" title=\"rise\" target=\"_blank\">rise</a> is instructive. As Lina Khan <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\" title=\"explains\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a>, “the company has positioned itself at the center of e-commerce and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it.” The “everything store” may seem like just another service in the economy – a virtual mall. But when a firm combines tens of millions of customers with a “marketing platform, a delivery and logistics network, a payment service, a credit lender, an auction house…a hardware manufacturer and a leading host of cloud server space” as Khan observes, it’s not just another shopping option.</p>\n<p>Digital political economy helps us understand how platforms accumulate power. With online platforms, it’s not a <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1716&context=ylpr\" title=\"simple narrative\" target=\"_blank\">simple narrative</a> of “best service wins.” Network effects have been on the cyberlaw (and digital economics) agenda for over twenty years. Amazon’s dominance has exhibited how network effects can be self-reinforcing. The more merchants there are selling on (or to) Amazon, the better shoppers can be assured that they are searching all possible vendors. The more shoppers there are, the more vendors consider Amazon a “must-have” venue. As crowds build on either side of the platform, the middleman becomes ever more indispensable. Oh, sure, a new platform can enter the market – but until it gets access to the 480 million items Amazon sells (often at deep discounts), why should the median consumer defect to it? If I want garbage bags, do I really want to go over to Target.com to re-enter all my credit card details, create a new log-in, read the small print about shipping and hope that this retailer can negotiate a better deal with Glad? Or do I, ala Sunstein, want a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/opinion/shopping-made-psychic.html\" title=\"predictive shopping\" target=\"_blank\">predictive shopping</a> purveyor that intimately knows my past purchase habits, with satisfaction just a click away?</p>\n<p>As artificial intelligence improves, the tracking of shopping into the Amazon groove will tend to become ever more rational for both buyers and sellers. Like a path through a forest trod ever clearer of debris, it becomes the natural default. To examine just one of many centripetal forces sucking money, data and commerce into online behemoths play out game theoretically how the possibility of online conflict redounds in Amazon’s favour. If you have a problem with a merchant online, do you want to pursue it as a one-off buyer? Or as someone whose reputation has been established over dozens or hundreds of transactions – and someone who can credibly threaten to deny Amazon hundreds or thousands of dollars of revenue each year? The same goes for merchants: The more tribute they can pay to Amazon, the more likely they are to achieve visibility in search results and attention (and perhaps even favor) when disputes come up. What <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html\" title=\"Bruce Schneier\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Schneier</a> said about security is increasingly true of commerce online: You want to be in the good graces of one of the neo-feudal giants who bring order to a lawless realm. Yet few hesitate to think about exactly how the digital lords might use their data advantages <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2828117\" title=\"against\" target=\"_blank\">against</a> those they ostensibly protect.</p>\n<p>Forward-thinking legal thinkers are helping us grasp these dynamics. For example, Rory van Loo has described the status of the “<a href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1491&context=yjreg\" title=\"corporation as courthouse\" target=\"_blank\">corporation as courthouse</a>”– that is, when platforms like Amazon run dispute resolution schemes to settle conflicts between buyers and sellers. Van Loo describes both the efficiency gains that an Amazon settlement process might have over small claims court, and the potential pitfalls for consumers (such as opaque standards for deciding cases). I believe that, on top of such economic considerations, we may want to consider the political economic origins of e-commerce feudalism. For example, as consumer rights shrivel, it’s rational for buyers to turn to Amazon (rather than overwhelmed small claims courts) to press their case. The evisceration of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-death-of-the-class-action-lawsuit/\" title=\"class actions\" target=\"_blank\">class actions</a>, the rise of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html\" title=\"arbitration\" target=\"_blank\">arbitration</a>, boilerplate <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9837.html\" title=\"contracts\" target=\"_blank\">contracts</a> – all these make the judicial system an increasingly vestigial organ in consumer disputes. Individuals rationally turn to online giants for powers to impose order that libertarian legal doctrine <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/books/review/democracy-in-chains-nancy-maclean.html\" title=\"stripped from the state\" target=\"_blank\">stripped from the state</a>. And in so doing, they reinforce the very dynamics that led to the state’s etiolation in the first place.</p>\n<p>This weakness has become something of a joke with Amazon’s recent decision to incite a bidding war for its second headquarters. Mayors have abjectly begged Amazon to locate jobs in their jurisdictions. As readers of Richard Thaler’s <em><a href=\"https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.thaler/research/pdf/the%20winner%27s%20curse.pdf\" title=\"The Winner’s Curse\" target=\"_blank\">The Winner’s Curse</a></em> might have predicted, the competitive dynamics have tempted far too many to offer far too much in the way of incentives. As journalist Danny Westneat recently <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/this-city-hall-brought-to-you-by-amazon/\" title=\"confirmed\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a>, Chicago has offered to let Amazon pocket $1.32 billion in income taxes paid by its own workers. Fresno has a novel plan to give Amazon special authority over how the company’s taxes are spent. Boston has offered to set up an “Amazon Task Force” of city employees working on the company’s behalf. Stonecrest, Georgia even offered to <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-stonecrest-georgia-rename-amazon-20171003-story.html\" title=\"cannibalise itself\" target=\"_blank\">cannibalise itself</a>, to give Bezos the chance to become mayor of a 345 acre annex that would be known as “Amazon, Georgia”.</p>\n<p>Note that these manoeuvres – what Tracey Kaye calls “<a href=\"https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/20106/03-Kaye_Final.pdf;sequence=1\" title=\"corporate seduction\" target=\"_blank\">corporate seduction</a>” via tax and other incentives – are not new.

The mayors are in a weakened position because their tax revenues are not high enough to support high quality municipal services, and now they’re succoring a corporate actor with a long history of <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=i_jyKcVbCw0C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=amazon+tax+holiday+1990s&source=bl&ots=LT8vz0eBod&sig=W0dOjWP4jxI1tfYO7ZP0Z0cN0qM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEnuj2i9vXAhVGct8KHefaBRo4ChDoAQhCMAQ#v=onepage&q=amazon%20tax%20holiday%201990s&f=false\" title=\"fighting\" target=\"_blank\">fighting</a> to push taxation <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/04/amazon-eu-tax-bill-luxembourg-deal.html\" title=\"even lower\" target=\"_blank\">even lower</a>. Similarly, the more online buyers and sellers are relying on Amazon to do their bidding or settle their disputes, the less power they have relative to Amazon itself. They are less like arms-length transactors with the company, than they are like subjects of a despot, whose many roles include consumer and anti-fraud protection.</p>\n<p>Even the federal government may soon <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737730\" title=\"privatise\" target=\"_blank\">privatise</a> critical procurement functions, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/02/amazon-amendment-online-marketplaces/\" title=\"relying\" target=\"_blank\">relying</a> on Amazon’s giantism to extract deals that the Defense Department is itself unable to demand.

This is more than twice the target to be achieved under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). To reduce this, the government put policies and programmes in place to facilitate institutional births. However, the uptake of these facilities has not increased and so the number of maternal deaths has not decreased. Further inspection makes it evident that the Indian public health system is unable to provide quality healthcare to all those who can’t afford the private sector.</p>\n<p>This is in part an issue of availability and accessibility of services. But even when the services are available, they are of poor quality, which deters people from utilising them further. This is what is seen during institutional births, when substandard, sometimes almost inhumane, care is <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/The-labour-room-bullies/articleshow/49791192.cms\" title=\"delivered by healthcare professionals\" target=\"_blank\">delivered by healthcare professionals</a>. Women face verbal abuse and discrimination; made to deliver on the floor due to lack of beds; not provided pain relief to avoid prolonged births and invasive procedures are performed on them <a href=\"https://qz.com/1146836/doctors-who-ignore-consent-are-traumatizing-women-during-childbirth/\" title=\"without their knowledge or consent\" target=\"_blank\">without their knowledge or consent</a>.</p>\n<p>Such acts of labour room violence against pregnant or gestating women are collectively termed obstetric violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of data</strong></p>\n<p>From the existing medical and public health literature, two facts about obstetric violence can be ascertained. First: it is a relatively new term, <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f17e/13dfa155bd75239c97635806ff00ea5869d3.pdf\" title=\"first used\" target=\"_blank\">first used</a> in legal forums in Venezuela around 2007. The discussion around dehumanised birth emerged in Brazil in 1993 but it was not until the mid-2000s that it gained traction with global bodies in public health. Second: some degree of disrespect and abuse during childbirth in health facilities had been recorded in studies globally and nationally for decades, and several of these have found an <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001847\" title=\"undercurrent of normalisation\" target=\"_blank\">undercurrent of normalisation</a>.</p>\n<p>A case in point is a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/maq.2003.17.1.49/abstract\" title=\"study from Tamil Nadu\" target=\"_blank\">study from Tamil Nadu</a> from 15 years ago, which found that women believed “the baby will only be born if the pains are strong”. The use of drugs to induce labour pains had become so normalised in urban and some rural parts of Tamil Nadu in the 1990s that women abstained from asking for pain relief.</p>\n<p>It is this collectivised, normalised nature of obstetric violence that health rights activists have begun highlighting as yet another manifestation of deep-seated patriarchal notions of control over women. We must understand that obstetric violence falls under the larger ambit of violence against women, which itself is a major public health concern. The truth behind poor health outcomes for women in India lies in part in the fact that violence meted out to them in different forms reduces their chances at a healthy life.</p>\n<p>Domestic violence against women in the form of beating, poisoning and burning has serious implications for health that get buried under the guise of a private matter best left to the family. Violence against the girl child is a bias within the community that disregards the right of every child to a safe and healthy life. It is with this lens that obstetric violence needs to be approached because childbirth is a vulnerable affair and can have varying outcomes for women depending on the kind of treatment they receive.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the research on this topic has been done from a global perspective. India has had only eight studies looking at labour room violence. Among the studies from around the world, a majority outline only a qualitative methodology; hard, empirical evidence is lacking. Studies have also tried to narrow down on categories of disrespect and abuse, and devise a typology – a classifications of acts generally faced by women that can be standardised as obstetric violence – but they are not specific to the Indian context. A systematic review classifies and highlights the major types of mistreatment of women in labour by providers. But due to differences in policies, programmes, infrastructure and, importantly, culture, the typologies <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001847\" title=\"can’t be picked up in toto\" target=\"_blank\">can’t be picked up in toto</a> to plan an intervention.</p>\n<p>For instance, many studies from around the world have shown the benefits of having the spouse or a trusted family member present for a smooth labour. A denial of birth companion is considered <a href=\"http://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(16)30103-6/abstract\" title=\"equivalent to mistreating women\" target=\"_blank\">equivalent to mistreating women</a>. But in countries like India, allowing a birth companion is usually not possible in a government set-up. While Tamil Nadu has introduced the concept of a birth companion in public facilities, this hasn’t been possible in other states. There is an infrastructural constraint – where there is overcrowding in the room with the obstetrician, resident doctor, nurses and interns. In private facilities, not allowing family members into the labour theatre is a policy for aseptic precautions. So whether this denial can be seen as a violation in India is debatable.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting consent</strong></p>\n<p>Another grey area in obstetric violence is invasive procedures. In India, caesarean sections are very often seen <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40276719?casa_token=XtAbngoZEYkAAAAA:bjSsyBJNWYZmBol-3U8uNF45MWpAT1TB9oB6HtKX5aeqw8jCd0pQtIY4F_MLqY7HxmIPmBAP76C4bjqinrHu-DlKnYa6PurGhxNOpVOXju3nF214XAg\" title=\"as a means of making money\" target=\"_blank\">as a means of making money</a> in the private sector and as a means of quicker labour in the public sector. But a more unknown, rampantly performed invasive medical procedure is episiotomy, where an incision is made in the skin between the vaginal cavity and the anus to make the pathway for the baby bigger.</p>\n<p>Although scientifically refuted, it is still carried out in high numbers. It is believed that in hospitals with low resources, they find that it is easier to surgically make a tear than to risk a tear later that will <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691058.2017.1384572\" title=\"lead to complications\" target=\"_blank\">lead to complications</a> that hospital staff is not prepared to handle. In some hospitals, this procedure is performed on every woman that gives natural birth.</p>\n<p>There is no question of explaining the procedure and/or taking consent. It may even be done without anaesthesia to save time or due to the absence of an anaesthetist. A more mythical, and misguided, reason is based on culture and race, where it is believed that Asian women have smaller vaginal openings than African-American or Caucasian women.</p>\n<p>The intersectionality of physical and verbal abuse and discrimination with caste, class or medical condition also can’t be denied. A large section of women that face obstetric violence belong to lower socio-economic backgrounds. They have to resort to public facilities for birth and expect such behaviour, and therefore do not think it is abnormal, illegal or ethically wrong. But this normalisation is an unacceptable reality that needs to enter the larger discourse.</p>\n<p>Slapping patients on their inner thighs and commenting, “You enjoyed making the baby, then why are you crying in pain now” <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/729784/i-cant-take-it-anymore-sights-and-awful-sounds-from-the-labour-room-of-an-indian-public-hospital\" title=\"should not be overlooked\" target=\"_blank\">should not be overlooked</a>. Verbally abusing patients for asking for pain relief by saying that they are ungrateful and shameless because they are already getting free treatment is discriminatory and goes against the very essence of a public health system. Women suffering from diseases like HIV and hepatitis B have an equal right to quality treatment while following universally recognised precautions.</p>\n<p>The reality of the quality of care has to do with a compendium of factors that are social, cultural and structural. More empirical, context-specific research is needed to devise a typology based on which interventions can be designed. Healthcare providers need to be held responsible for their actions and must treat women in labour as autonomous individuals. The discourse on obstetric violence needs to become larger. At the helm of this discussion must be the understanding that a woman has an absolute right over her body and will always reserve the right to be informed about and refuse any procedure that she does not wish to undergo.</p>\n<p><em>Surbhi Shrivastava is a postgraduate student of public health in health policy, economics and finance at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/211014/institutional-delivery-india-nightmare-women/\">Why Institutional Delivery in India Is a Nightmare for Women</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p>The trial of 13 financiers accused of funnelling more than CH15 million ($15.3 million) to the Sri Lankan Tamil separatist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) has started at the Swiss Federal Criminal Court.</p>\n<p>The accused are from Switzerland, Germany and Sri Lanka. Some are former members of the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which represented the LTTE in Switzerland until 2009, and include its founder, his deputy and the person in charge of finances.</p>\n<p>Between 1999 and 2009, they allegedly created a complex fundraising structure which involved coaxing members of the Tamil diaspora to obtain loans from banks. To raise higher amounts, the WTCC was accused of creating fictitious companies in the name of borrowers that issued fake salary certificates.</p>\n<p>The 13 on trial face charges of fraud, false documentation, money laundering and extortion. As the LTTE was never declared a terror organisation in Switzerland, they will not face charges of funding a terror group, unlike cases involving ISIS or al-Qaeda.</p>\n<p>“The Attorney General strongly suspects the LTTE fraction under investigation of having collected the money in question by means of threats and by creating a regime of fear to induce them to make the payments,” says a <a href=\"https://bstger.weblaw.ch/pdf/20150112_BB_2014_91.pdf\" title=\"court document\" target=\"_blank\">court document</a>.</p>\n<p>The Swiss funds were transported in cash by couriers to Singapore and Dubai, eventually reaching the LTTE in Sri Lanka who allegedly used the money to purchase arms. This funding system collapsed in 2009 after the LTTE’s military defeat at the hands of the Sri Lankan armed forces.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [the 13 suspects] should face trial as the LTTE struggled for the freedom and self-determination of Tamils, which is not a crime. It takes two parties to make a war and Switzerland should investigate the war crimes of the Sri Lankan army as well,” Anna Annor, president of Swiss Council of Eelam Tamils, told swissinfo.ch on Thursday.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-drawn saga</strong></p>\n<p>The whole process was set in motion in 2009 when the Office of the Attorney General launched an investigation against “unknown persons” for extortion, coercion, money laundering and organised crime.</p>\n<p>In 2011, a vast sting operation in several Swiss cantons resulted in the arrest of several suspects who were later released within a span of two months. A year later, a delegation from the office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Police travelled to Sri Lanka to interview around 15 witnesses.</p>\n<p>“Around 80% of Tamils living in Switzerland had made payments to support LTTE at the time to support the struggle against genocide. That does not make Tamils supporters of terrorism,” says Kuruparan Kurusamy, former president of the Swiss Council of Eelam Tamils.</p>\n<p>The trial of the accused was originally scheduled for June 2017. However, according to the <a href=\"https://www.tdg.ch/suisse/Le-TPF-deboute-un-Tigre-tamoul/story/29583651\" title=\"Tribune de Genève paper\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tribune de Genève</em> paper</a>, proceedings were delayed when the lawyer of one of the accused demanded that a bank involved in the financial transactions also be cited by the judge as one of the defendants. According to Kurusamy, the bank in question was Credit Suisse and he claims it had accepted 135 loans under the name of one Sri Lankan national based in Germany. An<a href=\"https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2018/01/06/credit-suisse-finance-tigres-tamouls\" title=\" article\" target=\"_blank\"> article</a> in the <em>Le Temps</em> paper, claims that Bank Now, a subsidiary of the Credit Suisse group, provided loans to 182 people at an interest rate of 12%.</p>\n<p>However, the chamber of appeals of the Federal Criminal Court dismissed the challenge, allowing the trial to go ahead. A verdict is expected around mid-March.</p>\n<p>Around 50,000 people from Sri Lanka live in Switzerland, mostly ethnic Tamils, who fled the island’s 30-year civil war that ended in 2009. Many applied for Swiss citizenship and as of 2016 there were slightly more than 28,000 people with Sri Lankan citizenship residing in Switzerland. In 2016, the Swiss government <a href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/ethnic-tamils_swiss-to-get-tough-on-sri-lankan-refugee-status/42282372\" title=\"announced\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> it would apply more stringent criteria for granting Sri Lankan nationals refugee status.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/anand-chandrasekhar/\" title=\"Anand Chandrasekhar\" target=\"_blank\">Anand Chandrasekhar</a> is a journalist at swissinfo.ch and is based in Bern, Switzerland.

Maharashtra and Gujarat, our two most highly urbanised states, account for about 30% of the country’s fire accident deaths. There is a close correlation between deaths due to fire-related accidents and population density associated with urbanisation.</p>\n<p>In cities after cities, towns after towns, year after year, Indians are getting killed and burnt in fire incidents. Technically speaking, these are not accidents; they are man-made disasters, manufactured by a mix of half-baked regulations and compromised enforcement machinery and powerful interest groups. They are actually planning-made problems.</p>\n<p>This is a classic example of India’s ‘disposal problem’ (a phrase <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/MarshallEtAlTheIranContraConnectionSecretTeamsAndCovertOperationsInReaganEra1987/Marshall%20et%20al%20-%20The%20Iran-Contra%20Connection%20-%20Secret%20Teams%20and%20Covert%20Operations%20in%20Reagan%20Era%20(1987)_djvu.txt\" title=\"borrowed\" target=\"_blank\">borrowed</a> from historical American foreign policy). Let’s see the usefulness of this concept in our context.</p>\n<p>The ‘disposal problem’ <a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZdPTT8SAzRoC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=America%27s+disposal+problem+contragate&source=bl&ots=QRKHfS-Rif&sig=-9QqJFGj5dJz3ZCr6ZZNGQWTkIo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC-fuprMLYAhVKRY8KHWM_ClYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=America%27s%20disposal%20problem%20contragate&f=false\" title=\"refers to\" target=\"_blank\">refers to</a> how a well-entrenched people, practice or protocol (interest groups, professional cliques, sellers or buyers in a market place, rules, laws, standard operating procedures, institutional matrix, collective mores and folkways, etc.) can end up defeating the very purpose for which it was created in the first place. There is an element of “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences\" title=\"unintended consequence\" target=\"_blank\">unintended consequence</a> of purposive behaviour” (Robert K.

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>A case in point is the origin and prosperity of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2329934/Parched-Delhi-mercy-tanker-mafia-flourishing-audacity.html\" title=\"water mafia\" target=\"_blank\">water mafia</a> in the national capital. The official water supply falls short of New Delhi’s needs by at least 207 million gallons each day, according to a 2013 audit by the office of the comptroller and auditor general. A quarter of Delhi’s households live without a piped-water connection; most of the rest receive water for only a few hours each day. So residents have come to rely, as shown by <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/17/at-the-mercy-of-the-water-mafia-india-delhi-tanker-gang-scarcity/\" title=\"Aman Sethi’s field reporting\" target=\"_blank\">Aman Sethi’s field reporting</a>, on private truck owners – the most visible strands of a dispersed web of city councillors, farmers, real estate agents and fixers who source millions of gallons of water each day from illicit boreholes, as well as the city’s leaky pipe network, and sell the liquid for profit. Any attempt to tackle Delhi’s water crisis will have to first involve dismantling the bureaucracy-business-water mafia nexus.</p>\n<p>Another example is Chennai’s land mafia and how it <a href=\"http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/chennai-floods-when-will-we-ever-learn/article9962568.ece\" title=\"caused the end-2015 floods\" target=\"_blank\">caused the end-2015 floods</a>. The Adyar river in the south of the original city had a spacious estuary and a broad flood plain. Many areas south of the river were marshy and low-lying, serviced by small rivulets and canals. Because of decades of faulty urban planning and the state’s hurry to industrialise, industrial complexes, educational institutions and housing estates have <a href=\"http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/chennai-floods-panel-report-highlights-encroachments-faulty-drainage-system-55329\" title=\"ravaged the watershed areas\" target=\"_blank\">ravaged the watershed areas</a>, filling up thousands of smaller ponds and streams and silting major tanks and increasing the surface water flow manifold. Between 1996 and 2015, more than 1,000 acres of this wetland was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-41144776\" title=\"allegedly illegally diverted\" target=\"_blank\">allegedly illegally diverted</a> to accommodate industrial installations belonging to state-owned companies, including a large port and several coal-fired power plants.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Also read: <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/192928/chennai-learn-anything-2015-floods/\" title=\"Did Chennai Learn Anything From the 2015 Floods?\" target=\"_blank\">Did Chennai Learn Anything From the 2015 Floods?</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>After the unprecedented rain 2015, this increased run-off found its way into the city. While the unusual rains have caused the disaster, the impact would not have been so severe in the absence of the man-made factors. The planned developments along the Adyar river that reduced its capacity as an outlet are largely government initiated, as the river bed was under government ownership. All the swamps, marsh lands, low-lying areas and streams that the big corporations, middle-class housing and slums have been built on are inundated as they are at the receiving end of overflowing large regional tanks. The state’s inability to enforce environmental laws and insatiable greed for land grabbing by both national and international commercial interests <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/chennai-floods-present-a-lesson-in-urban-planning/story-QOQlkG76xthZcNSqmQ5icL.html\" title=\"are in full play\" target=\"_blank\">are in full play</a> in Chennai. Any endeavour to undo the damage done by the organised encroachers to Chennai’s watershed and wetland areas will have to start with breaking apart the bureaucracy-real estate business nexus.</p>\n<p>India’s disposal problem is manifest in the context of urban fire safety as well. For example, Mumbai’s building norms have enough loopholes, such as norms not applying for establishments with a seating capacity of less than 50 people. Secondly, the city has <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/h3lFty4e0nyJlNDQ43q2hI/Why-Kamala-Mills-fire-tragedy-is-a-warning-for-urban-India.html\" title=\"failed to invest\" target=\"_blank\">failed to invest</a> in LIDAR-based (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies that can be used to aerially keep a track of setbacks and the presence of fire exits.</p>\n<p>As the city grows vertically, manpower-intensive physical inspection is not required to enforce all fire safety regulations. Moreover, adequate space could have easily been retained for essential services like fire stations while redeveloping mill land, but the city didn’t do it. There is a business-bureaucracy nexus working everywhere.</p>\n<p>India’s policy makers have a serious disposal problem at their hands when it comes to urban planning and management. From fire safety to waste recycling, from energy efficiency to water supply, from housing to traffic safety, the organised interest groups have infiltrated the state machinery and have been successful in damaging public interests as a matter of daily existence. By 2050, about 70% of the population will be living in cities and India is no exception. Mere post-incident sound bytes from the politicians and law enforcement agencies won’t help our urban population.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://thewire.in/author/basant-rath/\" title=\"Basant Rath\" target=\"_blank\">Basant Rath</a> is 2000 batch IPS officer who belongs to the Jammu and Kashmir cadre.
