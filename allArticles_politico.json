        "content": "<p>There is a very easy way for Democrats to get major concessions from President Donald Trump on immigration: Give him his Wall.</p><p>This is the key to a deal codifying the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era de facto amnesty for a segment of so-called Dreamers. All it takes is giving Trump a plausible start to the Wall that the president can then, in his inimitable way, promote as the greatest structure built on a border since Hadrian began his famous handiwork at the northern limit of the Roman Empire in 122.</p><p>That the Democrats very likely won’t do this speaks to their irrational aversion to a Wall that they can’t view dispassionately any more than Trump can.</p><p>It used to be that enhanced security on the border, and yes, a physical structure that in places is effectively a wall, had bipartisan support. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 passed the House by a vote of 283-138 and the Senate 80-19. It called for building roughly 700 miles of double-layer fencing on the border, and no one seemed to believe that the United States had irreparably sullied its reputation.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time anyone had thought of a fence, of course. There had been barriers in the San Diego area for a very long time, although not particularly robust ones. Beginning in the 1980s, more serious structures were built. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, there are 46 miles of fencing overall and 13 miles of double fencing in the San Diego-Tijuana corridor, where there used to be a nightly influx of undocumented immigrants. In some sections, the barriers are 10-feet-tall military helicopter pads indistinguishable from a wall. Again, no one believes San Diego has closed itself off from the world by adopting a common-sensical and — in this urban area — effective prophylactic against illegal immigration.</p><p>But Democrats now find find physical barriers on the border offensive, especially if they have enough solidity to be called a Wall. One immigration advocate, in a typical sentiment, told The Huffington Post that the Wall is a “tool to instill hate and division.” This lunacy has rapidly become Democratic orthodoxy. Harry Enten of 538 notes that in 2006 almost 40 percent of Democrats supported building a Wall. By February of last year, Democrats were against it by 89 percent to 8 percent.</p><p>The hostility toward the Wall is part of a broader Democratic leftward lurch on immigration, but also a simple schoolyard calculus that if Trump supports something, they must oppose it.</p><br><p>This forecloses the most basic legislative give-and-take. If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer gave Trump something significant on the Wall, they would be able to find their way home — as John Jay said after concluding an unpopular treaty with the British in 1795 — by the light of their own burning effigies. Their voters would scorn them as traitors complicit in the alleged horrid bigotry of Donald J. Trump.</p><p>So, they will probably fail to capitalize on a president almost certainly desperate to fall into their arms. At the extraordinary televised bipartisan meeting on immigration on Tuesday, Trump at one point said that he’d simply sign whatever Congress sent him. Aides and informal advisers who care much more about the substance of a restrictionist immigration policy quickly pulled him back in line. The White House said it wants the Wall and an end to chain migration and the visa lottery in exchange for DACA.</p><p>For his part, though, Trump surely cares about one thing above all, and that’s the Wall. He knows it was a signature campaign promise that fired up his voters like no other. He’d love to be able to go back to them with something, with almost anything, that he could brag about as the Wall. It’s doubtful that his standards are particularly high — at one point last year, he tried to argue that maintenance of the currently existing fence is, in effect, a Wall.</p><p>This means that even a partial step toward a Wall might entice Trump into a deal. On the substance, Democrats who are latitudinarian on immigration should prefer this to any other agreement. An end to chain migration and the diversity lottery would constitute major, meaningful changes in our legal immigration system and reduced numbers of immigrants. Other enforcement measures, like E-Verify for employers, would do much more to squeeze illegal immigration. The Wall is an enhancement of the status quo rather than a departure from it, and even if Democrats go along for now, it’s not clear that it would ever get built.</p><p>Trump’s statement at the DACA meeting that “I build under budget, and I build ahead of schedule” was the boasting of a developer used to having the leverage to squeeze contractors; it was completely removed from the reality of the federal government, even when grappling with much simpler projects.</p><p>The Secure Fence Act’s bold promise of hundreds of miles of double fencing petered out under bureaucratic resistance and congressional backtracking. Democrats could easily, if they take the House in 2018 or win the presidency in 2020, defund the Wall or otherwise sabotage it. But if they got a lawful amnesty for 700,000 illegal immigrants or even more, depending on the parameters of a deal, that’s never going away. It would in all likelihood become the predicate for further amnesties in the future.</p><p>That’s why restrictionists worried about Donald Trump’s reliability on this issue have an important backstop against a bad deal: the recalcitrance of Democrats who oppose the Wall more than they support amnesty for Dreamers.<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>LOS ANGELES — Seven immigration agents filed into a 7-Eleven store before dawn Wednesday, waited for people to go through the checkout line and told arriving customers and a driver delivering beer to wait outside. A federal inspection was underway, they said.</p><p>Within 20 minutes, they verified that the cashier had a valid green card and served notice on the owner to produce hiring records in three days that deal with employees’ immigration status.</p><p>The well-rehearsed scene, executed with quiet efficiency in Los Angeles’ Koreatown, played out at about 100 7-Eleven stores in 17 states and the District of Columbia, a rolling operation that officials called the largest immigration action against an employer under Donald Trump’s presidency.</p><p>The employment audits and interviews with store workers could lead to criminal charges or fines. And they appeared to open a new front in Trump’s expansion of immigration enforcement, which has already brought a 40 percent increase in deportation arrests and pledges to spend billions of dollars on a border wall with Mexico.</p><p>A top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the audits were “the first of many” and “a harbinger of what’s to come” for employers.</p><br><p>“This is what we’re gearing up for this year and what you’re going to see more and more of is these large-scale compliance inspections, just for starters,” said Derek Benner, acting head of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations, which oversees cases against employers.</p><p>“It’s not going to be limited to large companies or any particular industry — big, medium and small,” he said.</p><p>After the inspections, officials plan to look at whether the cases warrant administrative action or criminal investigations, Benner told The Associated Press.</p><p>7-Eleven Stores Inc., based in Irving, Texas, said in a statement that the owners of its franchises are responsible for hiring and verifying work eligibility. The chain with more than 8,600 convenience stores in the U.S. said it has previously ended franchise agreements for owners convicted of breaking employment laws.</p><p>Unlike other enforcement efforts that have marked Trump’s first year in office, Wednesday’s actions were aimed squarely at store owners and managers, though 21 workers across the country were arrested on suspicion of being in the country illegally.</p><p>Illegal hiring is rarely prosecuted, partly because investigations are time-consuming and convictions are difficult to achieve because employers can claim they were duped by fraudulent documents or intermediaries. Administrative fines are discounted by some as a business cost.</p><p>Amy Peck, an Omaha, Nebraska, immigration attorney who represents businesses, said an employer crackdown will never work because the government has limited resources and there are many jobs that people who are in the country legally do not want.</p><p>“When these audits occur, the employees scatter in the wind and go down the street and work for somebody else,” Peck said. “You’re playing whack-a-mole.”</p><br><p>President George W. Bush’s administration pursued high-profile criminal investigations against employers in its final years with dramatic predawn shows of force and large numbers of worker arrests. In 2008, agents arrived by helicopter at the Agriprocessors meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa, and detained nearly 400 workers. Last month, Trump commuted the 27-year prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, former chief executive of what was the nation’s largest kosher meatpacking operation.</p><p>Barack Obama’s administration more than doubled employer audits to more than 3,100 a year in 2013, shunning Bush’s flashier approach. John Sandweg, an acting ICE director under Obama, said significant fines instilled fear in employers and avoided draining resources from other enforcement priorities, which include child exploitation, human trafficking and money laundering.</p><p>Wednesday’s audits arose from a 2013 investigation that resulted in charges against nine 7-Eleven franchisees and managers in New York and Virginia. Eight have pleaded guilty and were ordered to pay more than $2.6 million in back wages, and the ninth was arrested in November.</p><p>The managers used more than 25 stolen identities to employ at least 115 people in the country illegally, knowing they could pay below minimum wage, according to court documents.</p><p>Neither 7-Eleven nor was its parent company, Seven &amp; I Holding Co. based in Tokyo, was charged in the case.</p><br><p>Julie Myers Wood, former head of ICE during the Bush administration, said the most recent inspections showed that immigration officials were focusing on a repeat violator. Part of the problem, Wood said, is the lack of “a consistent signal” between administrations that the U.S. government will prosecute employers who hire immigrants without legal status.</p><p>Some immigration hard-liners have been pressing Trump to move against employers. Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said the inspections offered “a good sign” that the administration was serious about going after employers. But, he said, the administration would need to go beyond audits.</p><p>“It’s important for Trump to show that they’re not just arresting the hapless schmo from Honduras but also the politically powerful American employer,” he said.</p><p>In Koreatown, agents gathered in a grocery store parking lot and drove through side streets in unmarked cars to their target location.</p><p>The manager was in Bangladesh and the owner, reached by phone, told the clerk to accept whatever documents were served. The clerk told agents he had no knowledge of documents required to prove eligibility to work and was asked to pass along brochures for voluntary programs aimed at better compliance with immigration laws.<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>The House is nearing agreement on a bipartisan plan to overhaul its workplace misconduct system after sexual harassment scandals forced the resignation or retirement of five lawmakers.</p><p>The chairman of the House Administration Committee, Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), said that he hoped to release the harassment legislation next week, send it from his panel to the House floor and possibly also steer it to House passage before the end of the week.</p><p>“That is my goal,” Harper told POLITICO. While he added that “that’s not etched in stone, obviously,” he said the forthcoming legislation had enough “broad bipartisan support” that it was likely to pass on the so-called suspensions calendar, which the House reserves for the most uncontroversial bills.</p><p>Harper and two other participants in the chamber’s bipartisan talks on remodeling the Capitol's handling of harassment complaints — criticized by advocates, aides and lawmakers alike as unfairly burdensome for victims — confirmed that the final legislation would ban the use of members’ personal budgets to pay for misconduct settlements.</p><p>Revelations in November that former Rep. John Conyers used his office’s personal budget to settle a harassment claim from an ex-aide in 2015 ultimately sparked the Michigan Democrat’s resignation. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) also<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/28/raul-grijalva-hostile-workplace-allegations-264099\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>acknowledged</u></a> using his committee budget to settle a workplace misconduct claim unrelated to sexual harassment, a move on which the House Ethics Committee had previously<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/01/congress-harassment-settlements-lawmakers-273896\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>offered</u></a> no firm guidance.</p><br><p>But under the forthcoming legislation, members’ personal budgets “will no longer be used” on harassment settlements, Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) said in an interview. “Oh, yeah, that was easy. Most of the big stuff was really easy.”</p><p>Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for more victim safeguards in Congress’s harassment system, also said Wednesday that she expected the legislation to ban the use of members’ personal budgets on settlements.</p><p>Speier also predicted that any final agreement would include almost all of the provisions in her harassment legislation, dubbed “ME TOO” after the nationwide movement that has surfaced sexual misconduct claims against a cavalcade of powerful men in media, politics and the arts.</p><p>“We’re on a fast track, and we’re in sync and working closely together,” Speier said.</p><p>Although the release of the legislation and a markup in Harper’s committee may yet slip to later next week, the time frame for Senate consideration of harassment legislation is far less clear.</p><p>The Senate Rules Committee’s top Democrat, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, is working with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and other members of the committee on a consensus proposal. But that language may prove sufficiently different from the House legislation to prevent the Senate from simply taking up even a bill that proves extremely popular on the other side of the Capitol.</p><br><p>“I think the Senate is relying upon us to at least get a good first draft,” Byrne said, “and I think that we are.”</p><p>While the Capitol was on high alert over harassment claims before its holiday recess, attention on the issue has cooled somewhat this month amid a firestorm over budget talks and immigration. But Harper made clear that he remained committed to seeing the reform process through to its conclusion.</p><p>“You’re seeing a sea change in the culture that’s occurred since we started looking at this a couple of months ago,” he said.</p><p>“This is not a difficult solution. You just treat people with some respect, and that begins at the top with the members and the chief [of staff]. And it should go all the way down to an unpaid intern.”<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>One day after Steve Bannon’s ouster from Breitbart News roiled the conservative media world, some saw new opportunity on Wednesday for other sites to rise, others felt that Breitbart would be just fine, and still others were simply happy to see the former master of the media dark arts vanquished.</p><p>“It’s been a good week and a half for me,” said Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart writer, who quit the site in 2016 after saying that Bannon did not adequately support fellow reporter Michelle Fields when she alleged that Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager, assaulted her. </p><p>Shapiro, who is now editor-in-chief of another conservative site, The Daily Wire, still loathes Bannon but said he harbored no ill will against Breitbart, a nationalist and populist outlet.</p><p>“They should live and be well,” he said. “I don’t hope other sites fail so we can succeed. I don’t think people are going to move from Breitbart to us. I think people visit more than one site. The idea that it’s an opportunity for us, I don’t see why. I think it’s an opportunity for them to move beyond Bannon.”</p><br><p>Many former Breitbart hands and devotees, like Shapiro, have bemoaned the site’s shift from its original, culture-warrior mission under Andrew Breitbart — who died in 2012 after founding the site in 2007 — to being a more nakedly political animal under Bannon, openly campaigning for candidates like Donald Trump and the failed Senate candidate Roy Moore.</p><p>Geoffrey Ingersoll, editor-in-chief of The Daily Caller, said he wasn’t concerned with whatever the future held for Breitbart, but also portrayed his own site as carrying the torch for the vision of its founder.</p><p>“We haven’t paid much mind to the state of Breitbart’s site, mostly because we’re busy producing stories and content our readers love,” Ingersoll wrote in an email. “But our best to Breitbart. We’ve always embraced their founder’s legacy — being happy warriors for truth. As for Steve Bannon, we believe in second chances. The Daily Caller has a fantastic spring internship program starting in two weeks.”</p><p>The world of online conservative news has become a crowded and, according to researchers, insular place. A<a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/analysis/breitbart-media-trump-harvard-study.php\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>study</u></a> out of Harvard and MIT found that, during the 2016 election season, readers of conservative sites rarely ventured outside the right-wing bubble for news. And as Trump rose in the GOP primary ranks, Bannon’s Breitbart became the hub of that world, as its most linked and shared site.</p><p>To the extent that any instability at Breitbart causes readers to wander elsewhere for news, they would probably be moving to other conservative outlets. </p><br><p>“If there’s a website or any product that is having an issue, and clearly, with Steve leaving, there’s a change going on, that’s an opportunity for others,” said Charles Herring, who owns the conservative One America News Network, “and the websites that are going to benefit are those that attract a similar target audience, which would be people that are independent or right-leaning.”</p><p>Herring said that his company’s focus was primarily on television, “but we’re putting more and more effort into our website.”</p><p>He said if Breitbart struggled with its transition, it could be reason to look at more digital investment — but that right now, it was too soon to know.</p><p>“From that standpoint, there’s obviously a potential opportunity, but then again, there’s an opportunity for Breitbart to bring in more talent,” he said.</p><p>Shapiro, the Daily Wire editor, said Breitbart had become so slavishly pro-Trump that if readers did for some reason wander away, they’d be more likely to go to sites that were equally so.</p><p>“Is there a world where there’s a more pro-Trump site that now steals Breitbart’s thunder?” he said. “That’s a possibility, but it’s not going to be people like me who gain from Breitbart going down. It’s going to be Gateway Pundit,” a far-right website.</p><p>Nicole Hemmer, a University of Virginia professor and author of “Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics,”<i> </i>said it was “hard to imagine” the site would abandon Trump, and that she expected Breitbart to more or less continue on its current trajectory without Bannon.</p><p>“There doesn’t seem to be any reason its influence would rise or fall in his absence,” she said in an email. “Bannon isn’t really a figurehead. He himself doesn’t have followers. It’s unlikely most readers will even notice he’s gone.” </p><p>Other agreed that, for Breitbart, the real issue probably wasn’t whether Bannon is or isn’t there, but whether the site continued to be, as Shapiro described it, “a Trump fan-zine.”</p><p>“Breitbart will remain a force,” Chris Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media, wrote in an email. “Don’t forget that they ran very effectively while Steve was in the White House, he wasn’t managing the site at all. The question is whether they will remain tightly aligned with President Trump, especially if he starts doing deals with the Democrats.”</p><br><p>Ruddy agreed with Shapiro’s assessment that if readers did leave, it would probably be for sites that lean even more right.</p><p>“Breitbart occupies a very narrow niche of conservatives that support isolationism, nativism and protectionism,” he said. “Newsmax has a very broad, influential audience, but we look at the conservative movement more as a big tent with unifying principles that Reagan espoused and we champion.”</p><p>Breitbart’s influence soared during the election, and as Trump has struggled, the site’s standing has dipped.</p><p>“Breitbart News is the #45th most trafficked website in the United States, according to rankings from Amazon’s analytics company, Alexa.com,” the site crowed in a<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2017/01/09/breitbart-news-45-trafficked-u-s-website-beats-huffpo-wapo-foxnews-2-billion-pageviews-2016/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>January post</u></a>. A current check of Alexa rankings shows Breitbart at 243rd.</p><p>At the same time, FoxNews.com, which has lately beefed up its staff and moved in a<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/23/fox-news-website-breitbart-312326\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>more Breitbart-esque direction</u></a>, has seen its traffic surge. Its Alexa rank is 59, and the site counted 2017 as its best year ever, with a 29 percent increase in average monthly unique visitors and a 17 percent jump in page views, year over year.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the political climate, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, there appears to be plenty of room for everyone, including Breitbart.</p><p>“The company’s organizational culture and business plan will inevitably get recalibrated in the coming months, but its core product — lightning rod news for the far-right — will probably hold steady,” he wrote in an email. “The appeal of politically antagonistic news seems larger today than in the recent past. Meaning that there should be room for competing news outlets to move into Breitbart’s market without necessarily crowding them out.”<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>U.S. commanders have launched an investigation into video footage that appears to show an American service member firing into the cab of a civilian truck as the two vehicles pass on a road in Afghanistan, an action that could have violated the military’s rules of engagement and may hamper the alliance with the Afghan government.</p><p>The shooting briefly appears<b> </b>during a gritty montage of combat footage allegedly recorded by U.S. troops battling the Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate. An anonymous user recently uploaded the video to YouTube under the title “Happy Few Ordnance Symphony,” then quickly removed it.</p><p>&quot;The amateur video posted on a public website gives us serious concern,&quot; the U.S. Central Command told POLITICO in a statement. &quot;The video in question is not official, not authorized and does not represent the professionalism of the service members of U.S. Central Command.</p><p>&quot;We are conducting an investigation into this video, and will take appropriate actions as a result of this investigation,&quot; it added.</p><p>POLITICO could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video.</p><br><p>The 3-minute, 9-second video doesn’t say where it was recorded, but the YouTube caption suggested it was shot in 2017. In the past year, U.S. troops have been engaged in intense combat with the Islamic State in Nangarhar Province, the group’s main Afghan stronghold, where teams of special operations advisers are fighting alongside elite Afghan troops to wrest key districts from the militants.</p><p>The troops in the video wear uniforms typical of U.S. special operations forces like the Green Berets, SEALs, Rangers and Marine Raiders, and are seen firing machine guns, grenade launchers, rockets, miniguns, mortars and calling in air or artillery strikes. The video, which is also set to music, is typical of the unauthorized combat montages that some troops create to share among themselves, often using footage shot from helmet-mounted video cameras.</p><p>But in addition to the rare glimpse of such shadowy operations up close, the brief scene of the truck shooting, 20 seconds in, sets it apart.</p><p>The clip in question shows a military vehicle approaching a truck with a white cab and black cargo cabin, of the type Afghans often call “Jingle trucks.” Military sources identified the first vehicle to POLITICO as a version of the M-ATV armored vehicle specially outfitted for special operations forces.</p><p>The clip is filmed from the perspective of an individual armed with a shotgun who is standing in a rear hatch of the armored vehicle.</p><p>As the armored vehicle comes alongside the truck, the individual lowers his military-style shotgun and appears to fire into the truck's driver-side window, causing the glass to shatter.</p><br><p>The armored vehicle appears to continue on its way. It is not clear from the footage whether the driver was harmed. No recoil indicating the firing of the shotgun is clearly visible in the footage, nor is a shell or casing seen exiting the weapon.</p><p>Special operations veterans with experience in eastern Afghanistan, who reviewed the video at POLITICO’s request and agreed those depicted looked like special operations forces, said shooting a shotgun into the driver’s door of the passing truck raised potential red flags — possibly showing “an operator not doing the right thing.&quot;</p><p>But they were also cautious about drawing any firm conclusions without far more context. It was not possible to tell which unit the shooter was from, or anything else about why the event took place. In particular, they could not tell from the footage whether the shotgun shell was a “lethal” round or a less dangerous “non-lethal” one, such as one designed for breaching doors or windows.</p><p>“With the shotgun engagement, you figure it is a lethal round, as you are in combat, but from the video you cannot conclusively determine,” one former special operator with experience in Nangarhar said. “It could readily have been a beanbag, hammer, or other non-lethal round, as when it hits glass you are going to get a similar effect.”</p><p>Nevertheless, another former special operator, also with experience fighting in Nangarhar, said that his unit “never carried non-lethal rounds on mission” because it did not use shotguns for breaching purposes.</p><p>“It may have been an operator not doing the right thing and firing a non-lethal round just to be a dick,” the first veteran acknowledged. But he suggested other possible explanations.</p><p>If the special operations team was responding to an attack or threat from near the truck, he speculated, they might have been closing in on the vehicle from various directions in a larger movement not depicted in the brief video. More fire might have been exchanged than the video showed.</p><p>“You do not know if there were ground forces moving on the flanks,” he said. “It is hard for me to question the man on the ground.”</p><p>Still, Central Command, without addressing directly the shooting incident, expressed deep dismay about what the video appears to depict.</p><p>&quot;I have reviewed the video and I am disappointed and also concerned that the American people, our Coalition partners, the Afghan government, and the Afghan people will believe that American service members are callous and indifferent to the horrors of war or the suffering of innocent people trapped in conflict,&quot; Army Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of Central Command added in a statement Wednesday. &quot;I can assure you that this video does not represent the professionalism or humanity of the men and women of U.S. Central Command. We reject the unprofessional and callous message this video conveys.&quot;</p><p>The U.S. military headquarters in Kabul has lauded the Nangarhar mission as a rare success story in the stalemated war effort against the Taliban and other terrorist groups, citing recent success in winning some districts back from ISIS.</p><br><p>But it has come at a cost for the U.S. advisers. Of the 13 American troops killed by hostile action in Afghanistan last year, seven died in Nangarhar, and another Green Beret was killed in the province on Jan. 1.</p><p>Older and better trained than conventional troops, special operations personnel operate with more autonomy and in smaller numbers.</p><p>That less oversight has also led to periodic allegations of misconduct. In 2009, a top special operations admiral halted his troops' operations after a series of botched raids in eastern Afghanistan.</p><p>Those raids led to the deaths of local policemen and civilians, the wounding of a small girl, and protests from the Afghan government and U.S. embassy.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Early last year as an Obamacare repeal bill was flailing in the House, top Trump administration officials showed select House conservatives a secret road map of how they planned to gut the health law using executive authority.</p><p>The March 23 document, which had not been public until now, reveals that while the effort to scrap Obamacare often looked chaotic, top officials had actually developed an elaborate plan to undermine the law — regardless of whether Congress repealed it. </p><p>Top administration officials had always said they would eradicate the law through both legislative and executive actions, but never provided the public with anything close to the detailed blueprint shared with the members of the House Freedom Caucus, whose confidence — and votes — President Donald Trump was trying to win at the time. The blueprint, built off the executive order to minimize Obamacare’s “economic burden,” that Trump signed just hours after taking the oath of office, shows just how advanced the administration’s plans were to unwind the law — plans that would become far more important after the legislative efforts to repeal Obamacare failed.</p><p>Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) obtained the one-page document from the Trump administration last month after blocking three of the administration’s health nominees to get it. Casey, who shared it with POLITICO, called it a list of options for “sabotage.”</p><p>“The primary problem here is government officials, government agencies, were taking steps that would lead to fewer people having coverage and erecting barriers to people having coverage,” he said. “In addition to that, you have kind of a closed-door, back-room slimy deal here that should trouble anyone.”</p><br><p>The document lists 10 executive actions the Trump administration planned to take to “improve the individual and small group markets most harmed by Obamacare.” Those include calling for stricter verification of people who try to sign up outside of the open enrollment period; cutting the sign-up period in half; and giving states authority to determine whether insurers had to cover the full range of benefits required by Obamacare and whether their networks of doctors were sufficient. Those policies are among seven proposals in the plan that have since been implemented. Four of the ideas and a portion of a fifth had been publicly proposed but not yet finalized when the document was shared.</p><p>Obamacare supporters opposed many of the changes after they were publicly released, arguing they would undermine consumer protections and make it harder for some people to obtain insurance coverage.</p><p>The document also said the administration would encourage states to build less robust exchanges than required by Obamacare and prevent health care providers from steering patients to Obamacare plans instead of to Medicaid — two policies that have not yet been enacted. </p><p>An HHS spokesperson did not return a request for comment on the document, including whether the agency plans to implement the remaining policies.</p><p>The document was a key part of a March 23 meeting in House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office among top Trump officials, including budget director Mick Mulvaney and then-HHS Secretary Tom Price, and several members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The House was about to vote for the first time on a bill to repeal Obamacare but conservatives were balking; they thought the bill didn’t go far enough to undo the health law.</p><p>Administration officials used the document to make the case that the legislation was just the first part of their repeal plan. Executive actions would be the second. But conservatives wouldn’t budge and the next day, Ryan pulled the bill. The House ultimately passed a repeal bill two months later, in May.</p><p>House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said it is routine for the administration to share its plans.</p><br><p>“It was shared — probably with a lot more emphasis — with the Freedom Caucus because there was a lot more concern with the inadequate nature of the original bill,” Meadows said Wednesday.</p><p>“I would say it’s not inappropriate,” Meadows added, pointing out that before Trump took office, the North Carolina Republican sent him a list of 300 regulations he’d like to see rolled back as “suggestions.” </p><p>Through the campaign and into 2017, the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill made no secret they intended to do all they could to repeal the health care law. Hours after he was sworn in, the president signed an executive order instructing his government to pursue Obamacare changes. But the order, as well as speeches and public comments by Trump and administration officials, often lacked many specifics.</p><p>Casey obtained the document last month after he placed a legislative hold on three HHS nominees — Robert Charrow for general counsel, Matthew Bassett for assistant secretary of legislation and Brett Giroir for assistant secretary for health. The holds effectively froze the nominations from being brought to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.</p><p>Casey said he issued the holds after months of fruitless back-and-forth between his office and HHS in an attempt to obtain the document, which was first reported on in <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-freedom-caucus-obamacare-repeal-replace-secret-pact-236507\" target=\"_blank\">a March POLITICO story</a>. </p><p>Barbara Pisaro Clark, HHS' acting assistant secretary for legislation, confirmed in a letter to Casey that the document was used in the March 23 meeting between Price and House lawmakers.</p><p>“We are not aware of any other Department of Health and Human Services materials being utilized during the meeting,” she wrote.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Republican leaders are considering skipping passage of a GOP budget this year — a blow to the party’s weakened fiscal hawks that would squash all 2018 efforts to revamp entitlements or repeal Obamacare.</p><p>White House and Hill GOP leaders discussed the possibility of forgoing the painful budget process during last weekend’s Camp David legislative summit, according to four sources familiar with the talks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has argued that he cannot pass controversial deficit-reduction legislation using powerful budget procedures with his new 51-vote majority — and wasn’t even sure he could find the votes for a fiscal blueprint in the first place.</p><p>Abandoning the budget, however, would be an embarrassment for Republicans, who for years railed against Democrats when they avoided one of the most basic responsibilities of Congress.</p><p>But more importantly, it would mean the GOP’s 2018 agenda would be sharply limited: Only with passage of a joint House-Senate budget can Republicans deploy reconciliation tools, which allow them to circumvent the Senate filibuster and bypass Democrats, as they did on last year’s successful tax bill and failed Obamacare repeal push.</p><p>That means no entitlement reform or welfare overhaul in 2018, a key priority for fiscal conservatives eager to shrink the now $20 trillion federal debt. Instead, President Donald Trump wants to focus on enacting a massive infrastructure package with help from Democrats. And conservatives are not happy about it.</p><br><p>“It’s legislative malpractice to throw reconciliation out the window,” Dan Holler, vice president of Heritage Action, told POLITICO on Wednesday.</p><p>Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), a House Budget Committee member, responded similarly when asked what he thought of the idea: “It’s another data point in a long series of unfortunate data points on fiscal discipline. … In the same way a budget is important for determining spending for a family, it’s one of those absolute necessities and basics of financial discipline in government.”</p><p>Talks to forgo a GOP budget this year come at a breaking point for many fiscal hawks.</p><p>Congressional leaders are knee-deep in bipartisan spending negotiations that are shaping up to be a nightmare for conservatives, potentially raising federal spending by more than $200 billion over two years, with few — if any — ways to pay for it. In the same month, Congress also plans to send Trump an $80 billion-plus disaster relief package, the largest of its kind, with no offsets. And just this week, House Republicans announced a plan to debate a return of earmarks, which conservatives have called the “gateway drug” to spending.</p><p>It’s the latest sign of the decline of the party’s fiscal conservatives under Trump, who has shown little interest in cutting government spending and has begun to mold the party into his own image. The discussions also reflect the reality of the GOP’s slimmed-down Senate majority and the difficult politics of an election year that threatens Republicans’ hold on Congress.</p><p>GOP sources familiar with the discussion have cautioned that the 2018 agenda is far from set in stone. What’s more, leaders haven’t ruled out trying to pass messaging budgets in their own respective chambers, even if they don’t adopt a unified budget that allows for reconciliation.</p><br><p>The House GOP, for instance, will probably have to try to pass such a document to keep its more conservative conference happy. But GOP leaders are under no illusion that such a plan could pass the Senate.</p><p>It’s one of the reasons some GOP leaders have discussed “deeming” top-line spending numbers — simply setting total spending levels without passing a budget. One idea that’s surfaced includes deeming numbers as part of any budget accord with Democrats in the coming days and weeks.</p><p>That’s unlikely to halt the push from some House Republicans for a budget, however. House conservatives say they are itching for a fiscal brawl in 2018, even if it means going up against GOP leaders.</p><p>Many House Republicans are still stung from last year’s budget standoff with the Senate, when the House was forced to abandon plans for steep cuts to “mandatory” programs and swallow the Senate’s deficit-busting blueprint. House conservatives are even fine with slicing deep into politically sensitive programs like Medicaid, food stamps or low-income housing subsidies to write a budget that reaches balance in 10 years — a task made exponentially more difficult after the GOP passed its tax plan that boosts federal deficits by more than $1 trillion over a decade.</p><p>In fact, House Budget Committee members have already started discussing priorities for their fiscal blueprint, including mandatory spending cuts they want to tackle this year. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), the outgoing chair of the House Budget Committee, said members have come up to her and said, “‘As soon as we get back, we’ve got to start on this budget again, and we’ve got to make sure we do mandatory spending cuts.’”</p><p>In a sit-down with POLITICO this week, Black said it would “absolutely” be a mistake for the House to skip a budget this year.</p><br><p>“They’re the problem,” she said, pointing to the Senate. “They don’t seem to have the same energy to get this financial situation under control, and that disturbs me, because you need both sides to do it.”</p><p>Rank-and-file lawmakers aren’t the only Republicans who will be unhappy with this outcome. Speaker Paul Ryan was eyeing reconciliation to pursue an ambitious welfare overhaul, though McConnell squashed the notion. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of several Republicans who’ve expressed a desire to take another run at health care using the fast-tracking tool.</p><p>Other Republicans seemed baffled that leaders would forfeit such a powerful legislative instrument so quickly.</p><p>“They need to change the [Senate] cloture rule, but until they do, the only way we’re going to be able to accomplish anything is through reconciliation,” Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said. “We have to use reconciliation.”</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Bipartisan Senate negotiators are making headway on a plan that would stave off an implosion of the U.S.-Iran nuclear pact, even as President Donald Trump nears a pivotal Friday deadline to decide on the future of a deal he has long derided.</p><p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and the panel’s top Democrat, Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, both said Wednesday that they had the broad parameters of a proposal to amend the 2015 legislation that required congressional review of former President Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with Tehran.</p><p>But translating the outlines of a new Iran measure into legislation that can overcome conservative resistance and liberal skepticism will pose a significant challenge. Conservatives are likely to chafe at any legislative attempt to fix a nuclear pact they have perceived as irredeemably flawed from the start.</p><p>The task facing Corker and Cardin is further complicated as Trump remains undecided over whether to keep giving Iran sanctions relief. If he opts to revoke the relief, it would effectively torpedo the nuclear agreement before Congress has a chance to meet his demands for a stricter deal.</p><p>Corker said that he talked about Iran with Trump during an Air Force One trip to Tennessee earlier this week, and that Trump’s top advisers were expected to outline their suggested course of action to the president on Thursday.</p><p>Should Trump agree to continued sanctions relief for Iran, congressional talks would get critical running room — and, Corker suggested, potentially end up with an agreement that could get attached to a government funding measure that’s likely to come to a vote next month.</p><p>“This can’t go on forever, and it would be good if this legislation could be attached to something that must pass,” Corker told reporters. “And we have some must-pass stuff coming up soon.”</p><br><p>Cardin didn’t rule out the possibility that any Iran language he and Corker can reach an agreement with Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would end up attached to a must-pass bill to surmount likely opposition from the left and the right.</p><p>“I would agree that this legislation — if we work it out and it has broad consensus — it’s going to have consensus from the center,” Cardin told reporters. “And therefore you may have members on the extreme that could disrupt it. … So it might be convenient to try to put it onto a must-pass bill.”</p><p>But Cardin underscored that neither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) nor House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been asked yet to consider Iran language as an add-on to any must-pass package. Current government funding expires on Jan. 19, at which point lawmakers may have to pass a new stopgap bill so they can keep working on a spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year.</p><p>Cardin also said that he would support slapping Iran with new non-nuclear sanctions alongside European partners in the nuclear deal, using new Iran sanctions power that Congress gave Trump last year to target Iran’s ballistic missile program and human rights violations. Those new penalties against Tehran are part of the package of recommendations that Trump’s advisers plan to make to him on Thursday,<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/10/trump-extend-sanctions-relief-for-iran-333706\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>according</u></a> to The Associated Press.</p><p>“We hope that Europe and the president will be on the same page on non-nuclear sanctions,” Cardin said. “That would be very positive.”</p><p>But Cardin added that he had told the Trump administration that Democrats were going to “want to have our input” on the Iran measure, making clear that any agreement he and Corker are shaping remained in its early stages.</p><p>“We know what they’re looking at, and the framework can work,” Cardin told reporters. “There is a framework that can work.”</p><br><p>Corker sounded a similar note, telling reporters that “we have a framework that’s generally good, and there’s some details that are still being discussed.”</p><p>Trump faces the convergence of two types of Iran deadlines over the next several days: a due date to certify whether Iran is in compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord, and another series of decisions to decide on the continued waiver of sanctions that were eased by the Obama administration in exchange for nuclear concessions. Trump<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/13/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-decertification-sanctions-243734\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>opted</u></a> not to certify Iran in compliance with the deal in October, although he chose not to ask Congress to reimpose sanctions to give lawmakers time to work out a legislative solution.</p><p>Among the issues under consideration is whether to remove the requirement that Trump certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear pact every 90 days. Cardin said he would not object to changing that provision although there are “some disadvantages” to doing so.</p><p>“We’ve been told a couple of times that the president does not like to sign papers like this,” Cardin said. “If he doesn’t want to do that, I don’t find it objectionable.”</p><p>Corker and Cardin met with McMaster at the White House last Thursday, and Corker spokeswoman Micah Johnson said that the Tennessean — who tangled with Trump publicly earlier this year — had spoken with McMaster by phone since that meeting.</p><p>“Senator Corker remains engaged in productive discussions with the White House and a number of his colleagues in the Senate about the appropriate path forward, and our allies continue to be updated on relevant developments,” Johnson said in a statement.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>As reports emerge that special counsel Robert Mueller is looking to put President Donald Trump in the interview chair, you’re probably wondering how the president’s legal team can and should prepare him for that meeting if it happens. Although every lawyer has their own style, and we don’t know everything that the president obviously knows about his own actions, there a few simple things that we can reasonably expect to happen before the president gets grilled by Mueller.</p><p>First things first: Even putting aside his constitutional title, the president is no ordinary client. He is in his 70s, has a healthy (albeit fragile) ego, and, after decades in the business world, is largely set in his ways about how he likes to do things. He is not a deeply analytical person, and he doesn’t like to get bogged down in details. He will not, for example—no matter how much his lawyers would like him to—be able to replicate the document-specific preparedness Hillary Clinton brought to her marathon, 11-hour congressional testimony concerning the tragedy in Benghazi, Libya. That has not been and will never be who Trump is and trying to prepare him in that manner would be a disservice to him, as it would only irritate and confuse him. </p><p>That aside, if the president is going to navigate this interview without stepping on any legal or political land mines, he absolutely must listen to the advice his lawyers are likely giving him and take this seriously. When Trump sat for a deposition in the summer of 2016 for a breach of contract lawsuit involving a planned restaurant at the Trump International Hotel, the opposing side’s lawyers’ mouths likely hit the floor when the president stated he had done “virtually nothing” to prepare for the deposition. During the deposition, he often gave boisterous and self-serving descriptions of events that were not completely factually accurate. That cannot happen here. </p><p>The president is now facing a prosecution “dream team” the likes of which he has never previously encountered. He cannot walk into this interview with Mueller and wing it. <b> </b></p><p>The stakes are high: I am assuming that Mueller does not primarily intend to use the interview of the president, which he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-indicates-he-will-likely-seek-interview-with-trump/2018/01/08/86100bb2-f473-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html?utm_term=.8d172e98dc7d\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> told Trump's lawyers on Monday that he was likely to request, as a fact-finding inquiry. (Trump countered on Wednesday that an interview with Mueller “seems unlikely.”) If there are relevant and material facts to be found, Mueller’s team has likely already obtained them through the plethora of subpoenas, interviews and grand jury testimony that have already occurred. Mueller’s objective is more likely to evaluate the president’s <i>demeanor</i> when answering questions, particularly when he’s addressing allegations that he tried on more than one occasion to obstruct the Russia investigation. The president’s motivation—particularly whether he had “corrupt intent”—in taking steps like firing FBI Director James Comey is something that can more easily be extrapolated by observing how Trump explains the context of those actions under pressure from a prosecutor than through a dry review of factual information in and of itself. </p><p>This means that the president’s lawyers must prepare him to address any number of potential topics, and <i>also</i> thoroughly coach him on how he will talk about them. They’ll do this with mock interviews. A standard mock session could consist of multiple lawyers jumping in with questions at different times, placing documents in front of Trump and seeking to trip him up on the facts.<b> </b>It would be advisable—although it is debatable whether the president would agree to it—for several mock interview sessions to be conducted before the president sits down with Mueller. </p><br><p>Those mock interview sessions must refresh his recollection about a lot of peripheral details surrounding not only the presidential campaign but also the early months of his presidency, details about which he likely has not thought twice since they occurred. He needs to be able to recall with a reasonable measure of clarity what (if anything) he knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, when he learned of it and the context of his involvement in crafting the official White House response when the media started reporting on the meeting in July 2017. He needs to be able to explain more clearly the motivation for his decision to fire Comey. And he needs to be able to address succinctly his past associations with individuals with questionable backgrounds and alleged ties to the Russian government, such as Russian-born real estate developer<b> </b>Felix Sater.</p><p>Since Trump’s lawyers cannot expect him to memorize myriad details concerning all these things, they should craft simple and easy-to-remember explanations for the president to use, and practice them over and over again with him. They need to make sure he is able to stick to the proverbial script when pressed. </p><p>This will also help Trump with one of his most important challenges during the Mueller interview: speaking in a clear and concise manner. </p><p>Trump is not a man of literary eloquence or refined communication. That can be an asset in this case. He naturally relies upon simple verbiage and is not prone to getting caught up in complicated or nuanced explanations. That’s good. He should keep it simple.</p><p>On the other hand, Trump also has a habit of engaging in repetitive but incoherent rants. These are client traits that form the basis for lawyers’ nightmares, and it will be incumbent upon the president’s legal team to smooth over these verbal tics to the best they can. If the president stumbles and gets sidetracked, history has shown us that he will start delving into tangential issues. A veteran prosecutor like Mueller will let the president go down that rabbit hole every time, if only to see if that is where additional information lies that could flesh out the entirety of the story. </p><p>If the president is properly prepared and has a fresh understanding of how he wishes to explain his actions and motivations, he should be able to navigate the interview well and avoid any legal land mines. If the president approaches this interview with the same haphazard approach with which he seemingly handles everything else, however, he could find himself in a world of political hurt from which there may be no rescue but impeachment.</p><br>",

Filing days are coming, so I think we’re pretty much through it.”</p><br><p>Those pending filing deadlines — California’s is on March 9 — mean members who have been on the fence, or who are facing dauntingly poor poll numbers, could join Issa and Royce in heading for the exits in the coming weeks. The early indicators of a wave election are glaring: Democrats won a handful of off-year and special elections in 2017. Even where they fell short of victory, the party performed better than expected. President Donald Trump’s approval ratings are stuck around 40 percent. And Democrats have a double-digit lead on the House generic ballot in most polls.</p><p>“This is the final window, so I expect the next month or so, we’ll see the last wave of retirements,” said former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis, who chaired the NRCC for two cycles in the 1990s and 2000s. “This is not 2006, and it’s not 1994 yet. But I do think the atmospherics are factored into these members’ rationale for retiring.”</p><p>The 44 House members not seeking reelection this year — 29 in Republican-held seats and 15 in Democratic-held seats — puts 2018 in the company of past wave-year elections when control of the House changed hands.</p><p>In 1994, 49 House members retired and Republicans netted 54 seats, according to Brookings Institution’s Vital Statistics on Congress. In 2006, 28 lawmakers retired and Democrats picked up 30 seats. And in 2010, 32 members retired and Republicans won 63 seats.</p><p>Not all Republican retirements carry the same weight in the battle for the House. Some committee chairmen calling it quits are prevented by internal party rules from remaining at the helm of their panels in the next Congress if Republicans hold the majority. Those include Reps. Jeb Hensarling and Lamar Smith of Texas, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, and Gregg Harper of Mississippi — each of whom represent safe Republican seats.</p><p>But Issa and Royce — along with retiring Republican Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Dave Reichert of Washington, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Dave Trott of Michigan and Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey — represent competitive districts. Clinton carried the seats currently held by Issa, Royce, Ros-Lehtinen and Reichert. A fifth GOP-held Clinton seat will likely open up later this week, with Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona expected to announce she will run for the Senate.</p><br><p>Taken together, Republicans see all the retirements and open seats as an indication that the 2018 elections are likely to follow historical patterns: The president’s party loses, on average, 23 seats in the House in the first midterm election of a new administration, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p><p>“It’s obviously the sign of an ugly cycle ahead,” said Adrian Gray, a Republican pollster. “Oftentimes, these ugly cycles appear early, and people see writing on the wall.”</p><p>Davis, the former NRCC chair, agreed.</p><p>“Every time another Republican retires, it makes it better for House Democrats — no denying that,” he said. “This is not what you want to see because, when we’ve seen these types of retirements in the past, as a general rule, a bad year follows.”</p><p>Democrats must also contend with a handful of open battleground seats. Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen is running for Senate, Minnesota Rep. Tim Walz is running for governor and New Hampshire Rep. Carol Shea-Porter is retiring. All three represent districts that Trump carried in 2016.</p><p>The sheer number of GOP open seats isn’t only troubling for what it portends historically, though. The vacancies force Republicans to spend heavily in a growing number of districts without the advantages of incumbents’ built-in name recognition and fundraising network.</p><p>Republicans believe their fundraising — bolstered by strong money hauls by the Congressional Leadership Fund, the flagship House GOP super PAC — serves as a firewall against an energized liberal base and long list of open seats. CLF and its associated nonprofit, American Action Network, announced this week that they had raked in $66 million over the course of 2017.</p><p>“Any time you’ve got to recruit new candidates and raise money from the ground up, it’s a more expensive proposition. But Republicans are posting historic numbers, and they’ve seen this coming from a mile away,” said Chris Grant, a Republican consultant. “To that the extent there’s any storm, they’re prepared to weather it.”</p><p>That storm is easy to see building, even if the long-range forecast for November is less clear. Trump’s approval rating is just under 40 percent in the RealClearPolitics average. Democrats have an 11.8-point lead on the generic ballot, on average — a lead consistent with making up the two dozen seats the party needs to win control later this year.</p><p>Trump’s poll numbers were warning signs for Issa and Royce, said Rob Stutzman, a GOP consultant there.</p><p>“There’s no denying that this is real evidence of how difficult Republican success can be in California,” said Stutzman. “But as with retirements elsewhere, for Republicans in districts that Trump lost, [Trump’s] performance is a substantial factor.”</p><p>Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Wednesday that the retirements of Issa, a wealthy self-funder, and Royce, who had $3.5 million in his campaign account as of Sept. 30, are signs that some Republicans are deciding money can’t save them.</p><br><p>“Momentum is on our side as Democrats this cycle. History is on our side. But while I see a clear path to the majority, these are all tough elections,” Luján said. “But the very nature that you see members of Congress in California [retiring] like Congressman Royce and Congressman Issa — who both have robust resources in their reelection accounts as well as personal wealth — I think sends a loud signal.”</p><p>Stivers, his GOP counterpart, acknowledged that “history is against us, and the presidential polling, too.” But he noted that Democrats failed to flip any GOP-held districts in special elections last year.</p><p>Despite the retirements, Stivers said Wednesday he thinks that Democrats are still “10 to 15 seats short” of really putting the House up for grabs.</p><p>“They’re getting more seats in play,” Stivers added. “I think at this point they need another 10 to 15 seats [to put the House] in play. They’re still not there yet. But they’re moving in the right direction, clearly.”</p><p><i>Heather Caygle and Steven Shepard contributed to this report.</i><br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>The frenzy about an Oprah run for president was as predictable as it is misplaced—not because it concerns the estimable Ms. Winfrey but because it reminds us once again that our collective obsession with the presidency ignores where the really consequential power lies. If we grasp that basic fact about American political life, we can find where Oprah can make a huge difference—this year.</p><p>Given President Donald Trump’s capacity to capture 99.8 percent of media attention at any given moment, it makes superficial sense<b> </b>to see Trump’s election as the key to hugely significant political change, and to see a possible Oprah run in 2020 as the next one. But when you look at what has changed in the Year of Trump, it becomes clear that the really significant election was what happened in the United States Senate. Had Democrats managed to capture the chamber in 2016, much, indeed most, of what Trump has accomplished would never have happened at all—which is why Democrats, and maybe even Oprah herself, should focus right now on 2018, not 2020.</p><p>It’s true that Trump’s accomplishments amount to quite an impressive list, something on which the president’s friends and foes alike agree. “As the year ends,” the once adamantly anti-Trump <i>National Review</i> said, “President Donald Trump is compiling a solid record of accomplishment.” A <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-year-for-trump-and-gop-lawmakers-rocky-start-smooth-finish-1513944001\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that “President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress, who opened their first year in full control of Washington on rocky terms, are closing it with a flush of late legislative achievements: a sweeping tax overhaul, a long-sought repeal of a pillar of the Affordable Care Act and a surprise deal to open up Arctic drilling.” Matt Lewis <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-trump-is-embarrassing-but-for-conservatives-this-really-wasnt-a-bad-year\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in the <i>Daily Beast</i> that “if you are a mainstream conservative, you have to be pretty happy today with what you found in your Christmas stocking. … On paper at least, [Trump] has wildly exceeded my expectations.” Even David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s key adviser, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1712/20/acd.01.html\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledged</a>, “He is doing consequential things.&quot;</p><p>But let’s take a closer look at what would have happened to this conservative wish list if Democrats had taken charge of the Senate in 2016.</p><p>Start with the radical reshaping of the federal judiciary now underway. Neil Gorsuch took the Supreme Court seat the Senate Republicans denied to Merrick Garland. A dozen federal appeals court judges have been confirmed, and dozens of nominations to the district courts now await Senate action. Oklahoma’s Sen. James Lankford has already threatened a “nuclear” option to stop Democrats from slowing down the process.</p><p>Now imagine a Senate with a Democratic majority of 51 or 52 seats; something that would have been highly possible if Democrats had lost half a dozen seats in the 2014 midterms, instead of nine, or had won close 2016 races in Missouri and a few other states. Would Gorsuch have been confirmed? It’s hard to imagine enough renegade Democrats siding with the Republicans to muster a vote to break the filibuster, which would still be in place. No way Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as <i>majority</i> leader would have wiped that out with Trump in the White House, as McConnell did to confirm Gorsuch.</p><p>Nor would Trump’s lower court nominees, culled from the wish lists of the Heritage Foundation and other staunchly right groups, have passed muster with Democrats in charge of the Judiciary Committee. Trump and Senate Republicans would have loudly objected, but given how Senate Majority Leader<b> </b>Mitch McConnell behaved when Obama faced a GOP Senate, the “sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander” response from Schumer would have been certain.</p><p>The federal bench, however, is only the start of how different things would have been. For example, while it’s true that a president’s Cabinet choices are generally accorded deference—unlike judges, they leave when the president leaves—some of Trump’s choices would never have survived a Democratic Senate majority. Jeff Sessions as attorney general? Public school adversary Betsy DeVos as education secretary? Scott Pruitt, dedicated opponent of the Environmental Protection Agency, as its director? Ryan Zinke, industry’s best friend, as interior secretary? </p><p>Take those Cabinet officials off the board, and replace them with a few Democrat-approved choices, and a host of Trump’s executive “achievements” become a lot more doubtful. Even if several of Trump’s favorite appointees did get through, the rollback of regulations affecting the environment, education policy, consumer protection, oversight of local police forces, would all be affected by a Senate eager to impose limits on what the executive branch can do, by legislative mandates. </p><p>The legislative record itself would look very different, too: The individual mandate would not have been repealed; the tax bill would never have passed the Senate in anything like its current form; and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy—without a border wall—would have been at the core of any Democratic negotiating points with the White House. </p><p>Most unnerving for the president, the investigative power of Senate committees would have been in the hands of a party eager to probe any hint of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian interests. Had Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the hearings into potential obstruction of justice would have begun within days. </p><p>Of course, a president still has significant power to change the political landscape: withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a foreign policy focused on “America First” and hostility to multinational agreements, a crackdown on immigration, policies to undermine the Affordable Care Act, all would have happened regardless of which party held Senate control (not to mention that big, beautiful nuclear button). And the outsize personality of Trump himself still would have sucked much of the oxygen out of the atmosphere.</p><p>But for me, the most urgent political question is whether Democrats can retake the Senate next year. While the capture of the House is more probable, the significantly greater power of the Senate is where much of the change that has taken place under Trump will accelerate or grind to a virtual halt.</p><p>And this is where Oprah comes in. She is the one figure in public life whose presence in communities around the country could make a significant difference in voter turnout. With her money, her fame and her drawing power, Winfrey could spend the next 10 months organizing public events to spur voter registration. She could bring celebrities of all sorts to her side in cities all across America, from Ashtabula to Zebulon. And she could make sure—with her own resources and others—that the logistics are in place to keep an aggressive voter registration effort alive long after she leaves.</p><p>This could all be done on a nonpartisan, tax-exempt basis; but given the fact of political life that Democratic-inclined voters are less likely to cast midterm votes, an Oprah-centric voter registration campaign such as this would inevitably mean more Democratic votes would be cast. (As a side benefit, this effort would help Ms. Winfrey learn whether she has the stomach for a presidential campaign.)</p><p>It’s understandable that the president’s biggest foes are obsessed with removing him from office—if not via impeachment or the 25th Amendment, then by voting him out in 2020. By that time, however, a Republican Senate will have put dozens more judges on the courts and sanctioned more decisions that touch American life, from the quality of our air and water to the nature of our justice system and beyond. And that’s why it makes urgent sense for Oprah to aim her unequaled personal power at the most genuinely consequential source of political power.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's abrupt decision to remove Florida's coastal waters from the offshore drilling plan he issued a week ago sparked a backlash Wednesday, failing to mollify Florida's congressional delegation, galvanizing opposition in other states and even angering Trump administration allies in the energy industry. </p><p>Zinke's announcement that he would take offshore drilling “off the table” in order <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretaryZinke/status/950876846698180608\" target=\"_blank\">to protect Florida's tourism industry</a> was dismissed by critics as political theater designed to benefit Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is likely to challenge Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for his seat this year.</p><p>And it set off an outcry in other coastal states whose waters Zinke is seeking to open up for oil and gas exploration, with elected officials calling for the same treatment that Florida got — even as the oil industry criticized Zinke for reneging on the plan to give companies access to lucrative fields off the state's Gulf Coast.</p><p>Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an email that Zinke &quot;intends to meet with or phone every governor who submits a meeting request. Governor Scott was the first to do so.&quot; </p><p>California state officials plan to make their case to Interior using the same arguments as Florida, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told POLITICO. The state also boasts a huge coastal tourism economy and, like Florida, hosts military bases whose operations could be disrupted by oil spills or offshore drilling operations. </p><br><p>“That standard they applied to Florida is the one we intend to use,” Becerra said in a telephone interview. “We will be reaching out with the administration and others concerning our position.”</p><p>The waters off California still host oil platforms placed there decades ago, a testament to the state's history as a major offshore oil source. But it changed course after a 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, and Becerra said any push to use the state's existing offshore operations as a reason<b> </b>to<b> </b>open its doors to the industry again as &quot;not a winning argument.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Our people, locally and statewide, have spoken on this,&quot; he said. </p><p>Florida Republicans, far from accepting Zinke’s offer as a done deal, said they will still pursue legislation to extend a moratorium on drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is set to expire in late 2022. Florida lawmakers said earlier in the week they had gotten word that House Speaker Paul Ryan was open to such a legislative measure, a pathway Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio also <a href=\"https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=B09015C7-E734-4DA9-830A-8EDE9889065D\" target=\"_blank\">backed</a>. </p><p>“My goal is still a permanent ban on offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf,” Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepRooney/status/950914719757586432\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. “I firmly believe that Speaker Ryan will continue to support Florida and I believe that we will be successful in achieving this goal.”</p><p>Ryan's office did not reply to questions. </p><p>Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said Zinke’s change to a drilling program that expires in 2024 didn't offer Florida Republicans long-term assurances that plans to drill off the coast would not return, and his statement that Florida needed to protect its tourism industry was too broad a criterion to rely on.</p><br><p>“That applies to every state — Utah as well,” Bishop told reporters. “I assume that before anything is actually done or finalized, we’ll be sitting down with him and we’ll be working together and coming up with some legislative assessment to the entire situation.” </p><p>Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat opposed to new offshore drilling in his state, agreed that citing the threat to tourism from oil and gas activity opened the door to other states to argue the same. </p><p>“Secretary Zinke, by putting his rationale in writing, is now stuck with it,” Lieu told POLITICO. “There’s no standard he can legally meet to justify attempting [to limit it to] just Florida. He has to either exempt every state that meets his standard or exempt no states. It will backfire.” </p><p>Mere hours after Zinke made his announcement, lawmakers from both parties in states on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts were citing that same argument. Although the charge was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/950930700143874048\" target=\"_blank\">led</a> by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) and Oregon Gov. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KateBrownForOR/status/950901934935830528\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Brown</a>, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and South Carolina's Republican governor and Trump supporter Henry McMaster joined the chorus.</p><p>“I am opposed to offshore drilling off the South Carolina shore,” McMaster said at a Wednesday press conference. “Our tourist industry, our glorious natural resources ... are beyond compare in the United States. We cannot take a chance with those resources, those industries and that economy. I will be taking appropriate steps and there will be more news later.”</p><p>Zinke’s announcement also disappointed the energy industry that had considered him an essential ally. A source at one oil and gas producer operating in the Gulf of Mexico said the secretary’s Tallahassee announcement came as “a surprise.” </p><br><p>“A lot of people in industry, especially those already in the Gulf of Mexico, were keeping their eye on that part of the country for a long time. Everyone was thrilled by this opportunity,&quot; said Tyler Nelson, a lobbyist at Cornerstone Government Affairs<b> </b>who represents energy companies. &quot;To have this here and then pull the rug out from underneath them is frustrating.” </p><p>In a statement, the powerful American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday's reversal was &quot;premature,&quot; and it said &quot;the administration and policymakers should follow the established process before making any decisions or conclusions that would undermine our nation's energy security.&quot;</p><p>The National Ocean Industries Association, a lobby group representing offshore oil and gas producers, had called Zinke’s original offshore drilling plan proposal “bold” just six days ago, but now described the about-face as “disappointing and premature.”</p><p>“Having heard from the Governor of Florida, we look forward to commenting and sharing our views on what resources, owned by the American people, should be open and considered for exploration and production,” NOIA said in a press release. </p><br>",

        "content": "<p>The 25th Amendment is back on the table. </p><p>D.C. pundits are contemplating it. Cable news shows are talking about it. And in a recent television interview, Michael Wolff—whose book, <i>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</i>, has much of the free world agonizing over the possibility that President Donald Trump is mentally unfit to be chief executive—<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/367816-wolff-25th-amendment-alive-every-day-in-trumps-white-house\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> the amendment, by which the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet may declare a president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office” and appoint the vice president in his stead, “is a concept that is alive every day in the White House.” </p><p>But is the 25th Amendment really in play here—and, what’s more, should it be? </p><p>If original intent were the sole standard, the answer would probably be no. </p><p>Forged in the shadow of John Kennedy’s assassination, amid heightened Cold War tensions, the 25th Amendment was designed to address serious lapses in the Constitution’s provisions for presidential succession. Specifically, it was designed to protect the government from random occurrences like sudden illness or a failed assassination attempt. </p><p>Its framers might have agreed that it could be invoked to remove a president who suffered mental illness that led him to lapse into a state of delusion or unreason. But not a president who already demonstrated those traits when the people, in their wisdom, elected him to office. It didn’t occur to Congress that Americans might need an amendment to protect themselves from their own poor judgment.<br></p><p>***</p><p><b>The Constitution was originally silent </b>on the details of presidential succession, providing that only upon the death or incapacitation of the incumbent, the vice president would assume the “Powers and Duties” of the president. What that actually meant was unclear.</p><p>When William Henry Harrison died barely a month into his term in 1841, it wasn’t obvious whether his successor, John Tyler, was in fact the president, or still the vice president but enjoying presidential powers. Tyler was at his family home in Williamsburg, Virginia, when a State Department official knocked on his door to deliver the news of Harrison’s passing. He departed for Washington post haste and deliberately arranged to take the oath of office since, according to the judge who swore him in, “doubts may arise.” Tyler was determined to beat back suggestions by Congressman (and former president) John Quincy Adams that he was no more than “acting president.” The new chief executive insisted on being paid a presidential salary—the vice president’s stipend was a fraction of that amount—and bristled when letters arrived at the White House, addressed to the “Vice-President-Acting-President.” But the precedent stuck. When Zachary Taylor and Abraham Lincoln died in office, it was widely assumed that their successors became president immediately.</p><p>More problematic was James Garfield’s assassination in July 1881. The president was mortally wounded but clung to life—first in Washington, D.C., and later in the New Jersey shore town of Elberon—for 2½ months, during which time Chester Arthur, the vice president, remained in Washington but studiously avoided any appearance that he had assumed the mantle of office. When for a time Garfield appeared to rally, the vice president returned to his home in New York, leaving the White House wholly unattended. Despite the president’s steadily declining condition, Arthur refused to sign presidential orders or appointments while Garfield was still alive, fearing that they would be of dubious constitutional legitimacy whether the president survived or not. Only with Garfield’s death in September did Arthur assume the presidency. Though the government essentially ground to a halt for two months, left unanswered was exactly who had been in charge for the better part of the summer. </p><p>Congress didn’t spend much time on the question; neither did it have to when William McKinley succumbed quickly to an assassin’s bullet in 1901, and when Presidents Warren G. Harding and Franklin Roosevelt died unexpectedly in 1923 and 1945, respectively, of natural causes. </p><p>But in that time, the presidency—indeed, the entire executive branch—had grown enormously in power and importance. The United States had emerged from World War II as one of the world’s two unrivaled military and economic powers. During his eight-year presidency, Dwight Eisenhower suffered three serious medical problems that required surgery or sedation or otherwise left him incapacitated for a time: a heart attack, a stroke and an abdominal procedure. By agreement, his vice president, Richard Nixon, did not assume the powers of acting president formally but did preside over Cabinet meetings and ensure a continuity of office. “During that time,” observed the <i>Allentown Morning Call</i>, “confusion reigned concerning the division of authority between Nixon and presidential assistant Sherman Adams.”</p><br><p>After JFK’s death, it became clear that the modern executive branch required an updated succession plan. It had barely been acceptable in 1881 that for two months the country had essentially been without a president. That possibility was unthinkable in the nuclear age. What if Kennedy hadn’t died but had been incapacitated? Two years earlier, the world had come to the brink of war during the Cuban missile crisis. If Kennedy had been in a coma—or, trickier still, conscious but unable to function fully—who might have steered the country through the next crisis? </p><p>As a contemporary newspaper noted, this was hardly an “academic problem. … Three presidents have been incapacitated while in office without officially requesting that their vice presidents go to bat for them, for a total of about two years.” Perhaps the most egregious example was Woodrow Wilson, who, “felled by a stroke in September 1919, lay partially paralyzed for almost 1½ years, until his term expired in March 1921, while his wife and certain executive and legislative officers battled over the mantle of presidential authority.” </p><p>Ultimately, it was Eisenhower who suggested the remedy that Congress adopted. </p><p>In a letter dated March 1964, the former president told Birch Bayh, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, that in his “personal view,” the question of a president’s fitness to serve should “be left strictly to the two individuals involved, the President and the Vice President, subject possibly to a concurring majority opinion of the President’s Cabinet.” Ike further stipulated that a “disability could be of different kinds, one caused by physical or mental illness, or another by an absence from the seat of Government of such a character that would preclude Presidential decisions and action in a time of emergency.”</p><p>The amendment as passed—first by Congress in 1965 and then ratified by the states two years later—hewed closely to Eisenhower’s proposal. It empowers the vice president and a majority of the “principal officers of the executive departments” to declare the president unfit and to install the vice president on an acting basis. Upon the president’s assertion that he or she is fit to carry out the duties of office, the same group can acquiesce or, if they disagree, once again declare the president incapacitated; it would then fall to Congress to adjudicate the matter. By a two-thirds vote in each chamber, members can reinstall the vice president on an acting basis. (Congress has 48 hours to decide.) In theory, this process could play out ad infinitum, with the president declaring himself fit and Congress voting the opposite over and over again.</p><p>On several points, the provision is ambiguous. For one, it’s not clear who the “principal officers of the executive departments” are. It could mean Cabinet members. But several officials are accorded Cabinet “status” without leading recognized Cabinet agencies. There would surely be a court battle over this point. </p><p>More important, as an editorial in <i>The Times</i> of Shreveport, Louisiana, observed in 1965, “providing for the Vice President to assume the powers—but not the office—of President at times when the latter is incapacitated involves the tough question of what constitutes incapacity and the tougher one of whether the President believes himself unable to carry on his duties.” The world is full of patients who insist they are ready to go back to work—or that they can drive, live alone or manage their finances—over the protestations of doctors and loved ones. But most of those people aren’t the putative leader of the free world.<br></p><p>***</p><p><b>There’s little question</b> that the 25th Amendment provides a mechanism whereby the vice president and Cabinet can declare a president incapacitated—whether physically or mentally. But strictly speaking, the amendment’s framers seemed to anticipate that such incapacitation would come in the form of a natural or man-made event—an assassination attempt, a fall, a natural degeneration of health. They didn’t expressly foresee a future in which the American electorate would install in the White House someone <i>already</i> unfit to serve.</p><p>Put another way, Donald Trump has not—to the best of our knowledge—suffered a stroke or blow to the head since the 2016 election. He is who he is, and he has been like this for a very long time. </p><p>Yes, some of Wolff’s reporting comes as a surprise—like the fact that even close aides doubt Trump’s mental acuity, or that the president allegedly didn’t recognize a series of old friends at Mar-a-Lago last month. But we already knew that Trump can’t stay on point, that he’s inattentive to detail and belligerent in the extreme, that he repeats himself and that he has a troubled relationship with the truth: Long before he purported to believe that Barack Obama “tapped” his phones, he believed Obama had fabricated his birth certificate. And it’s fairly clear that he is a narcissist of the first order—a man who claims credit for things that he didn’t do, who insists he is a “genius,” and who defaults on financial and family obligations with casual disregard for nearly everyone around him. </p><p>But we knew all that. </p><p>It’s comforting to think that the 25th Amendment provides us reprieve from our own folly. But it doesn’t, or at least, it probably shouldn’t. Americans who “just couldn’t vote for Clinton,” who saw no difference between the two major parties, or who couldn’t be bothered to vote at all are stuck with him. And so are the rest of us.</p><p>Of course, there’s another mechanism to remove a president. It’s equally messy but much more clear cut. If Americans are really that determined to unseat the president, that’s the one they should be focused on.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Donald Trump delivered a big political contribution to Rick Scott on Tuesday as the Florida governor contemplates a bid for U.S. Senate: a pledge to spare Florida from administration plans to expand offshore oil drilling nationwide.</p><p>The surprise announcement from Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke — who went to the trouble of flying to Tallahassee to stand beside Scott — outraged environmentalists and Democrats who insist<b> </b>the decision was a political ploy that unlawfully gave preferential treatment to Florida, a swing state that voted for Trump and that’s home to his so-called “Winter White House” escape at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.</p><p>Zinke made sure that the term-limited governor got all the credit. In response to a question about what was the final determining factor in his decision, Zinke said: “The governor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have a tremendous governor that is straightforward, easy to work for, says exactly what he means. And I can tell you Florida is well-served,” Zinke said.</p><p>Zinke’s glowing endorsement of Scott has become de facto policy for Trump, who has tried for more than a year to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/12/31/scott-to-meet-dine-with-trump-at-mar-a-lago-165109\" target=\"_blank\"><u>woo Scott</u></a> publicly and privately to run for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson. The veteran senator is one of the most vocal opponents of offshore oil-drilling in Florida, an issue that typically enjoys broad bipartisan support in a state whose economy depends heavily on tourism and development along 1,300 miles of coastline.</p><p>Scott used to be an exception to the blanket opposition to offshore oil drilling. In 2010, the then-political newcomer voiced more support for oil exploration, but the position became a political liability in the state after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill coated some Florida beaches with tar balls and damaged tourism in parts of the Gulf.</p><p>A 2016 University of South Florida-Nielson poll found that 47 percent of state residents see offshore drilling as a move in the “wrong direction,” a distinction that makes it one of the most unpopular policy proposals in the state.</p> <br><p>So when Zinke <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/04/trump-drilling-coasts-pacific-atlantic-florida-324025\" target=\"_blank\"><u>announced </u></a>last Thursday that the administration wanted to open vast new stretches of federal waters to oil and gas drilling, opposition was united in Florida — from liberal environmentalists to conservative lawmakers and even Scott, who issued a rare <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/01/04/scott-wants-florida-removed-from-federal-offshore-oil-drilling-plan-170772\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public denunciation</u></a> of the policy.</p><p>At the time, Democrats and Nelson supporters highlighted the unpopular policy announcement by a president who’s flagging in the polls. Nelson’s campaign began fundraising off of the initial announcement to expand oil exploration.</p><p>One Republican insider, however, told POLITICO shortly after the initial announcement that the administration would scale the plan back somewhat to give Scott a political boost that would “be a big win, and it won’t be Bill Nelson bringing it home.”</p><p>As late as Tuesday, Nelson was still fundraising off the drilling announcement. “President Trump is about to hand a huge victory to the oil industry and put Florida’s entire economy at risk,” Nelson’s campaign wrote. “He just announced plans to rollback offshore drilling regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, and open up nearly all federal waters to offshore oil drilling — including the eastern Gulf of Mexico.”</p><p>But just before that email solicitation was sent out, Zinke was unexpectedly standing in Tallahassee’s regional airport with Scott announcing the reversal to the Florida capital press corps.</p><p>Nelson said he was incredulous.</p><p>“I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. But now, suddenly, Secretary Zinke announces plans to drill off Florida's coast and four days later agrees to ‘take Florida off the table’? I don’t believe it,” Nelson said in a written statement. “This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott, who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career. We shouldn’t be playing politics with the future of Florida.”</p><p>Similarly, the Sierra Club of Florida said the decision was “a purely political move to aid the ambitions of Rick Scott.” And the League of Conservation Voters called it a “publicity stunt.”</p><p>Scott’s spokesman, Jonathan Tupps, said oil-drilling opponents should not be upset.</p><p>“Senator Nelson and anyone else who opposes oil drilling off of Florida’s coast should be happy that the governor was able to secure this commitment,” he said. “This isn’t about politics. This is good policy for Florida.”</p><p>Tupps said that, contrary to claims by Scott’s opponents, the governor and staff have frequently discussed Florida’s opposition to more offshore oil drilling with the Interior Department. Scott personally raised the issue with Zinke in an October meeting in Washington, Tupps said.</p><p>Why Zinke suddenly reversed months of planning four days after announcing the new oil and gas exploration policy are unclear. Zinke also made his announcement via Twitter after a brief question-and-answer session with reporters in Tallahassee.</p><p>In reversing the policy for Florida, however, Zinke may have have run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act, critics said. That could give ammunition to California and Atlantic Coast states wanting to get on the same no-drill list -- the opposite of what President Donald Trump intended when he directed Zinke to expand oil companies’ access to federal waters to boost U.S. energy production.</p><br><p>The American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard earlier in the day had applauded the Trump administration’s plan to make all available federal waters available for drilling, saying “It represents a bold acknowledgement of the industry’s advancements in technology to safely access U.S. energy resources.”</p><p>Almost immediately after Zinke’s announcement, lawmakers from other states took to Twitter to raise the specter of lawsuits, which could lead to courtroom entanglements for Interior’s offshore drilling plan. The proposal<b> </b>was supposed to go into effect in 2019 and offer acres off the coast of Florida in late 2022 when a drilling moratorium officially ends.</p><p>“Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an agency can't act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. In this case, exempting Florida but not California (which has an even larger coastal economy) is arbitrary and capricious,” Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat and attorney, told POLITICO.</p><p>“So the agency would either have to not exempt Florida, or in the alternative, exempt Florida, California and any other state that can show the coasts are important to the state's tourism and economy.”</p><p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra also hammered that point on Twitter, echoing Scott’s argument against drilling off the Florida coast to say “California is also ‘unique&quot; &amp; our ‘coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.’ Our ‘local and state voice’ is firmly opposed to any and all offshore drilling. If that's your standard, we, too, should be removed from your list. Immediately.”</p><p>In Virginia, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine took a more low key approach. “Virginia’s governor (and governor-elect) have made this same request [as Florida], but we have not received the same commitment. Wonder why...” he tweeted.<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>When Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart found out that President Donald Trump had endorsed earmarks on national television, the 15-year House veteran fist-pumped into the air. </p><p>“Am I smiling when I’m not supposed to?” the Florida Republican asked reporters, chuckling.</p><p>In a week consumed by infighting over immigration, it was Trump’s unexpected affirmation of pork-barrel spending that had Washington spinning.</p><p>Trump's improvised tribute to earmarks Tuesday lasted just two minutes after an unrelated White House meeting, but the political effects could be far-reaching as Congress mulls whether to allow a revival.</p><p>Trump reminisced in seeming familiarity with Congress that in the old days, lawmakers of both parties “went out to dinner at night, and they all got along, and they passed bills” — a vastly different portrait from today’s gridlock. Earmarks, he suggested, could “get this country really rolling again.”</p><br><p>The chances of ending the 2011 ban are dim in a midterm election year with the GOP's congressional majorities at stake. But some lawmakers have hope now that a key GOP committee is planning its first set of hearings on the issue in years. And House GOP leaders recently moved to restart a debate on earmarks that has been put on hold since fall 2016 in the wake of Trump’s “drain the swamp” electoral victory.</p><p>Trump’s latest taboo-busting position pits him against years of GOP orthodoxy, vexing powerful conservatives who helped propel him to the presidency. Heritage Action called it “nearly unthinkable.”</p><p>“If Republicans bring back earmarks, then it virtually guarantees that they will lose the House,&quot; Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>But the president also gave voice to a nostalgia that’s shared by many long-serving members of Congress, even if they don’t often say it out loud.</p><p>“Maybe they’ll breathe life into the whole idea. I’m all for earmarks,&quot; said House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.), whose panel would be ground zero for a revival of pet projects. Frelinghuysen has long argued that it’s better for lawmakers to submit requests through his committee, rather than air-dropping them into spending bills through eleventh-hour amendments. </p><p>Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), who has served since 1997, was happily surprised to hear Trump’s support, especially since it would empower Congress over executive agencies. “Usually the administration doesn’t promote that,” he said.</p><p>A longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, Aderholt said he could back a return to earmarks “as long as it’s done on a fair and transparent basis.” He said it’s better for elected representatives to dole out government cash, rather than “a group of bureaucrats a thousand miles away.”</p><p>“The misnomer about that is that it is a ‘swamp’ issue,” Aderholt said. “You could make the argument that this is more getting rid of the swamp, holding people accountable.”</p><br><p>Republicans insist it wouldn’t be a return to Congress’ old habits. Instead, they argue, it could grease the skids for government projects now choked off by bureaucratic red tape. Speaker Paul Ryan specifically cited the Army Corps of Engineers, which he said has “not been up to snuff about getting its job done.”</p><p>“I want our members to have conversations,” he told reporters Tuesday.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats reeled at Trump's comments.</p><p>“He’s supposed to be a conservative, he’s a GOP president, and he’s talking openly about, ‘Let’s get them back,'” said Stan Collender, a longtime observer of the budget process and former Democratic budget staffer. “No Democrat would get away with this.”</p><p>Democrats are unlikely to back any push to bring back earmarks in an election year, though plenty of members, particularly appropriators, support it. </p><p>“I'm for earmarks, I’ve made that pretty clear publicly,” Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the second-highest-ranking House Democrat, told reporters Wednesday. He then rattled off a list of spending rules that have been tightened over the past decade. </p><p>“I believe it is the responsibility of the Congress of the United States to appropriate money for objects that it believes are in the best interests of their communities and their country,” Hoyer said, adding that he plans to testify at next week’s House Rules Committee hearing.</p><p>Line-item expenditures — also known as earmarks — were banned after a series of spending scandals that even led to jail time for one member.</p><p>Former Rep. Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham (R-Calif.) was sentenced in 2006 to eight years in prison for accepting millions of dollars in bribes from defense contractors.</p><p>Two years later, lawmakers came under fire for the so-called Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska. The $200 million expenditure exploded onto the national stage with the help of the 2008 GOP presidential ticket, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. </p><p>Democrats launched reforms when they won control of both chambers in 2006, attempting to rein in funding for what were known as lawmakers’ “pet projects.” Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi instituted a one-year moratorium in 2007.</p><p>But the drastic action came in 2011, after Republicans decisively won back their House majority. (The push was led by then-Speaker John Boehner, who proudly refused earmarks throughout his 21-year span in Washington.)</p><p>Weeks after the 2010 election, GOP leaders vowed to ban earmarks entirely — one-upping their Democratic counterparts who had sought to ban earmarks only for projects that benefited private companies. Public and nonprofit-driven projects would still be allowed.</p><br><p>Both parties helped increase scrutiny of the appropriations process in the late 1990s and early 2000s, at the same time that Congress was financing more special projects through spending bills.</p><p>In 1994, there were fewer than 2,000 earmarks. By 2005, there were about 14,000, according to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-republican-congresses-used-lots-earmark/\" target=\"_blank\">PolitiFact</a>. </p><p>Congressional leaders doled out the spending perks to members for any number of reasons: to reward party loyalty, to secure support for unrelated bills or simply to keep the government open.</p><p>Members of the powerful House spending panel — who have witnessed the decline of &quot;regular order&quot; in appropriations over the past decade — are particularly keen to restore the practice.</p><p>With a perpetual shortage of votes for spending legislation, Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that lawmakers once had a vested interest in those bills. Some have likened the 2011 ban to the Prohibition era, predicting that leadership will ultimately feel pressured to reverse course.</p><p>Now, Trump has lent his support. </p><p>&quot;Our system lends itself to not getting things done, and I hear so much about earmarks — the old earmark system — how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,&quot; he said.</p><p><i>Jennifer Scholtes and Heather Caygle contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected this week to extend relief from economic sanctions to Iran as part of the nuclear deal, citing progress in amending U.S. legislation that governs Washington's participation in the landmark accord, according to U.S. officials and others familiar with the administration's deliberations.</p><p>But Trump is likely to pair his decision to renew the concessions to Tehran with new, targeted sanctions on Iranian businesses and people, the six people briefed on the matter said. The restrictions could hit some firms and individuals whose sanctions were scrapped under the 2015 nuclear agreement, a decision that could test Tehran's willingness to abide by its side of the bargain.</p><p>The individuals — two administration officials, two congressional aides and two outside experts who consult with the government — weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. They cautioned that Trump could still reject the recommendation from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster and that no final decision had been made. They said heated discussions were going on within the administration and with key Republican lawmakers.</p><p>The State Department and White House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Trump must decide by Friday to extend the nuclear-related sanctions relief for Iran's central bank or re-impose the restrictions that President Barack Obama suspended two years ago.</p><br><p>The old, central bank sanctions largely cut Iran out of the international financial system, and are considered to be the most powerful of the penalties imposed by the U.S. during the Obama era, along with global penalties for buying Iranian oil. Some Iran hawks want to see both sets of restrictions return, but the six people with knowledge of Trump's plans say the president isn't planning to reinstate either at this point.</p><p>The individuals said Trump's top national security aides appear to have successfully made a different case to the president: Waiving anew for 120 days the nuclear-linked sanctions while simultaneously imposing new measures to punish Iran's ballistic missile testing, alleged terrorism support and human rights violations.</p><p>Such a balance could satisfy Trump's demand to raise pressure on Iran, while not embarking on a frontal assault on the most central trade-offs of the nuclear agreement. While the U.S. and other world powers rolled back economic restrictions on Tehran, the Iranians severely curtailed their enrichment of uranium and other nuclear activity. Trump has complained that many of the Iranian restrictions expire next decade and has vacillated between talk of toughening the deal and pulling the U.S. out entirely.</p><p>A senior State Department official told reporters Wednesday that Tillerson and Mattis would be meeting with Trump on the matter before an announcement Friday. Trump, Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence were scheduled to have lunch Wednesday at the White House after a formal Cabinet meeting.</p><p>The decision coincides with the administration's efforts to secure a face-saving fix from Congress on the requirement for Trump to address Iran's compliance every three months. In October, Trump decertified the nuclear deal under U.S. law, saying the sanctions relief was disproportionate to Iran's nuclear concessions, and describing the arrangement as contrary to America's national security interests.</p><p>Tillerson told The Associated Press in an interview last week that he and others were working with Congress on ways to amend the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, or INARA, to resolve concerns Trump has with the deal. That will be coupled with diplomacy with European government on addressing Iran's missile testing and support for the Hezbollah militant movement, Shiite rebels in Yemen and Syrian President Bashar Assad.</p><br><p>&quot;The president said he is either going to fix it or cancel it,&quot; Tillerson said of the overall deal. &quot;We are in the process of trying to deliver on the promise he made to fix it.&quot;</p><p>On the INARA law, it's unlikely Congress could move fast enough to codify changes by Friday. So Tillerson and others are hoping to convince the president there's enough momentum to warrant another extension of sanctions relief and not jeopardizing the entire agreement. The goal would be for Congress to make the changes sometime before May, when Trump is next required to address the sanctions.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Iran deal, one of Obama's signature foreign policy achievements, as the worst ever negotiated by the U.S. He has particularly bristled at having to give Iran a &quot;thumbs up&quot; every few months by acknowledging that it is meeting the requirements to invest in foreign banks, sell petroleum overseas, buy U.S. and European aircraft, and so forth.</p><p>Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere worry the changes being discussed don't strengthen the nuclear deal enough.</p><p>One would automatically re-impose, or &quot;snap back,&quot; suspended sanctions if Iran commits certain actions, possibly including things unrelated to its nuclear program. Currently, Congress must act for the sanctions to snap back.</p><p>Another proposal would require snapback if Iran refuses a request from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog, to inspect a military site not currently being monitored. Iran hawks worry the IAEA, fearing a confrontation with Iran, won't even ask for such an inspection.</p><br><p>Other debates center on Iran's missile testing. Hardline Republican Sens. Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz want sanctions back if Iran launches any ballistic missiles capable of targeting territory outside of Iran, such as Israel or Saudi Arabia, and not just an intercontinental missile.</p><p>Senate Democrats, generally more supportive of the nuclear deal, are pushing their own suggestions. One would let a simple House and Senate majority stop any effort to snap back sanctions, unless the president vetoes the block. While such a mechanism is unlikely to threaten Trump in the short term, some anti-deal Republicans fear it could be used against them under a future Democratic president.<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>A challenge to Ohio's system for purging voters got a skeptical reception at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, with two of the court's Republican-appointed justices and one Democratic appointee sounding sympathetic to the state's use of a voter's failure to vote to trigger a process that often leads to being dropped from the registration rolls.</p><p>At issue is how to interpret a prohibition in a 1993 federal law, the National Voter Registration Act, on the use of non-voting as a basis for removing people from the list of registered voters. </p><p>Civil rights groups contend that language means a failure to vote cannot be used to initiate a voter's removal, while Ohio contends it is permitted to use two years of non-voting to send out mailings that can ultimately result in voters being dropped. Voting rights activists say the process leads disproportionately to minorities being disenfranchised.</p><p>During an hourlong oral argument session at the high court, Justice Samuel Alito expressed the strongest support for Ohio's position, while Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly sought to poke holes in the arguments of those challenging the state's practices. Justice Anthony Kennedy also seemed skeptical about the challenge, although his stance seemed less definitive.</p><p>Three of the court's Democratic appointees — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg — expressed disagreement with the state's interpretation of the law.</p><br><p>Alito argued that the law is most logically read as a prohibition on using non-voting as the sole basis for removing a voter from the rolls. &quot;The statute itself takes failure to vote into account,&quot; he observed, referring to sections talking about how long a voter must be kept in an inactive status before being struck altogether.</p><p>However, Kagan suggested Alito was departing from his professed loyalty to textualism by reading in something that isn't actually in the portion of the law that's in dispute.</p><p>&quot;Isn't that just adding a word into the statute that Congress wrote?&quot; she asked &quot;To add that word, 'solely,' is to change the meaning of the statute and that word is not in that provision. Usually we say Congress knows how to do a 'solely' provision and it didn't do it here.&quot;</p><p>Sotomayor suggested the state's actions were part of a pattern of making it harder for certain groups of voters to cast their ballots.</p><p>&quot;What you do results in disenfranchising disproportionately certain cities where large groups of minorities live, where large groups of homeless people live,&quot; she said.</p><p>Sotomayor also said it was &quot;not a reasonable inference&quot; to say someone moved because they did not vote and didn't answer a mailing. She noted that a Senate report related to the legislation asserted that voters had the right to stay home.</p><p>&quot;They believed failure to vote was a constitutional right. You have a constitutional right not to vote,&quot; Sotomayor argued.</p><p>Later in the argument, Roberts picked up on that issue, suggesting that the courts, or at least the Supreme Court, have never resolved that issue.</p><p>&quot;There are many democracies that require you to vote, right? Australia ... you get a fine if you don't vote. And other places. And I have certainly seen it proposed it would be a good idea, given the low voter turnouts in our country, that we adopt something like that as well,&quot; the chief justice said.</p><p>One surprise came from Justice Stephen Breyer, a Democratic appointee, who said he believed that states needed a viable process to remove voters who have either died or moved.</p><p>&quot;What are they supposed to do?&quot; he asked. &quot;I don't believe Congress would pass a statute that would prevent a state from purging a voter file of people who died or moved out of state.&quot;</p><br><p>Kennedy seemed to strike a similar tone, sympathetic to states trying to clean up their rolls.</p><p>&quot;The reason they're purging them is they want to protect the voter roll from people ... that have moved and they're voting in the wrong district. That's the reason. What we're talking about are the best tools to implement that reason, to implement that purpose,&quot; he said.</p><p>However, when Solicitor General Noel Francisco rose to defend Ohio's practice, Sotomayor immediately challenged him, pointing out that the Trump administration has reversed the interpretation of the law held by the Justice Department under Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p><p>&quot;It seems quite unusual that your office would change their position so dramatically,&quot; Sotomayor said.</p><p>Francisco said he concluded that earlier interpretations that a state needed &quot;reliable evidence&quot; before initiating the process to remove a voter had no foundation in the statute. &quot;That's found nowhere in the text. ... Congress in fact rejected&quot; such proposals, he said.</p><p>While defending his interpretation, the solicitor general did allow that some aspects of the law might be murky. &quot;The NVRA is not one of those statutes that I would hold up as a paradigm of legislative drafting,&quot; he quipped.</p><p>Defending the Buckeye State's laws, Ohio State Solicitor Eric Murphy said officials needed to do more than simply use postal change of address lists to clean up voter rolls, a practice he said was &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; to the task because people often fail to file such forms. </p><p>While some activists have argued that the law prohibits triggering removal of voters based on failure to vote, the lawyer challenging Ohio's practices, Paul Smith, actually took a more subtle position Wednesday. He said failure to vote could play a part, but simply sending out a forwardable mailing and then removing a voter for failing to respond left states with no relevant basis for acting except non-voting. </p><p>Smith appeared to concede that a non-forwardable mailing returned by the postal service as undeliverable would give a state enough information to move forward with switching a voter's registration to inactive and, eventually, deleting it.</p><p>Roberts said he felt that concession, that non-voting could sometimes be a factor in starting the process, undercut Smith's case.</p><br><p>Despite the extensive arguments on the issue, no lawyer or justice mentioned that many people now rarely or never look at their so-called snail mail, preferring to communicate almost exclusively by electronic means, like email, text or social media.</p><p>However, Breyer did say that on occasion he does junk all his postal mail without reading it. &quot;I confess to doing that sometimes,&quot; he said.</p><p>Smith said that practice is common and underscores the dangers in Ohio's system of sending a single mailed notice to those who haven't voted for two years.</p><p>&quot;Most people throw it in the wastebasket. ... It doesn’t provide any evidence at all,&quot; he said, adding that officials are left with no information about where a voter is living and &quot;no idea which trash can it was thrown in.&quot;</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Lawmakers from both parties insisted Wednesday that they're still racing to reach a deal on Dreamers — despite a court ruling the night before temporarily reinstating the immigration program that President Donald Trump is trying to shut down.</p><p>A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Trump’s effort to completely shut down the Obama-era initiative known Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — a ruling that, in theory, will allow people who have already obtained DACA permits in the past to renew them. The program allows undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children to obtain work permits and remain in the country.</p><p>Democrats and immigration advocates worry the Trump administration will quickly appeal the decision and prevail. Meanwhile, Republicans dispute the findings of the judge, San Francisco-based U.S. District Court judge William Alsup, and believe the White House will win an appeal.</p><p>“It doesn’t change the need for us to act,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “I don’t think it relieves the anxiety of the DACA recipients that something is gonna happen. It really just adds additional uncertainty, I think, into the mix. So we’re plowing ahead like we discussed yesterday at the White House.”</p><p>Cornyn is one of four top lawmakers — the others include Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) — who are trying to meet with administration officials later Wednesday to sketch out next steps on an immigration deal in Congress. </p><br><p>Key Senate Democrats also stressed that Congress still needs to press for a Dreamers deal.</p><p>“Let me be very clear: The ruling last night in no way diminishes the urgency of resolving the DACA issue,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday morning. “The only way to guarantee the legal status for Dreamers is to pass DACA protections into law and do it now.”</p><p>Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) sounded less confident that the ruling wouldn't ease pressure on Congress, which often needs a deadline to act.</p><p>“I hope it doesn’t” lessen the urgency on Congress, Flake said of the ruling. “But I am worried.”</p><p>The substance of the judge’s ruling — which included Alsup’s assessment that Trump’s move to wind down DACA was meant to improve the White House’s bargaining position on immigration — could embolden Democrats to take a harder line against accepting various conservative demands as part of an immigration deal. </p><p>Democrats have already started to raise alarms about the mere contours of an agreement, which would include not only a permanent protection for Dreamers but border security provisions and changes to family-based immigration laws and the diversity visa lottery. </p><p>In an interview with POLITICO late Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former House Democratic leader, contended: “Why would anyone want to negotiate a bad deal to get DACA now that it’s become clear the court is saying the Trump administration may have tried to repeal the program in an unlawful way?&quot; </p><p>“I hope it can be a moderating influence on the other side, the Republican side, upon some of their demands,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said. “But at the end of the day, I think that in order to make a deal, a deal implies there’s negotiations by both sides.”</p><br><p>Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the White House said they disagreed with the ruling, though neither said said directly whether the administration would appeal Alsup’s decision. </p><p>But White House legislative director Marc Short said Wednesday on NPR that the ruling doesn’t relieve the urgency for Congress to reach an immigration deal.</p><p>“If we let this drag out, the risk would be that the Supreme Court would say yeah we’re overturning the decision and immediately DACA ends,” Short said on NPR. “And so it’s better to give us some opportunity to find a legislative fix as opposed to risking status for all those individuals.” </p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Eight months ago, moved by what we were witnessing in the American president, we joined 25 other psychiatrists and mental health experts in putting our concerns into a book, <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Case-Donald-Trump-Psychiatrists/dp/1250179459/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" target=\"_blank\">The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump</a></i>. We believed Trump’s mental state presented a danger to the public and felt we had a duty to warn them. We intended the book, which became a best-seller, as a service, putting the royalties into a fund for public good.</p><p>Since the book’s publication, however, we have faced a wave of backlash—not just from political observers but from doctors in our own field.<i> </i>Many commentators claimed that we were violating the Goldwater rule, the American Psychiatric Association’s ethical directive that psychiatrists should not diagnose anyone they have not personally evaluated. A past president of the American Psychiatric Association called our work “tawdry, indulgent, fatuous, tabloid psychiatry.” We heard similar criticisms last week, after <span>Politico</span> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/03/trump-25th-amendment-mental-health-322625\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that one of us, Dr. Bandy Lee, had met with members of Congress to discuss the president’s behavior and mental health.</p><p>But these criticisms get two things wrong: first, that we are violating the Goldwater rule, and second, that we should avoid talking about the president’s mental health. Without diagnosing Trump in a specific way, as the Goldwater rule prohibits, it is not only acceptable but vitally necessary to have a public conversation about mental state of our nation’s leader.</p><p>When the American Psychiatric Association created the Goldwater rule in 1973, in reaction to an article in <i>Fact</i> magazine citing hundreds of psychiatrists who had said Republican candidate Barry Goldwater was unfit to be president, the association was rightly concerned that the profession’s reputation would be harmed by careless opinions made in public. But the APA recently decided to interpret the rule more strictly: Where previously it forbade only diagnosis from afar, as of March 2017 the association <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjK2Znb383YAhVN21MKHRYeAjIQFggpMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychiatry.org%2FFile%2520Library%2FPsychiatrists%2FPractice%2FEthics%2FAPA-Ethics-Committee-Goldwater-Opinion.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3ZEzipszpCDm6nGHhVRDpq\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> it prohibits <i>any</i> commenting on the mental health of a public figure. Orthopedists, cardiologists and other medical authorities can enlighten the public about health issues that affect public figures, such as heart conditions—but physicians with specific training and experience in mental disorders cannot. By fiat of the APA, the Goldwater rule has effectively turned into a gag rule.</p><p>The Goldwater rule, in its original conception, served an important purpose—one that our writings and speeches have not undermined. All 27 experts who contributed to <i>The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump</i> took pains <i>not </i>to diagnose the president in the book. (Bandy, who edited the book, is a strong proponent of the Goldwater rule and particularly opposes modifying it under political pressure.) A formal psychiatric diagnosis is reached after careful study of the patient, including taking a history, performing a physical, reviewing lab results and history of past illnesses and treatments, and obtaining supplementary perspectives from close family members. A diagnosis forms the basis for a treatment plan individually designed for that patient’s future care. An individual’s dangerousness, however, can be reliably assessed by interviewing co-workers and intimates, reviewing the individual’s past statements and behaviors, reviewing police reports and, crucially, assessing context. While an in-person interview can be quite useful, it is not strictly required to assess danger.</p><p>Furthermore, we are not interested in Trump’s personal issues, which are his private affair. We comment on the traits of the president only in relation to the public office he holds, and with the express interest of educating and warning the public against danger. </p><p>Not only does our book not violate the Goldwater rule, but the APA’s expanded interpretation of it is at odds with the association’s ethics code, which actually allows psychiatrists to speak about psychiatric issues in general when asked about a public figure. In fact, the code obligates psychiatrists to “participate in activities contributing to … the betterment of public health.” Thus, quashing a conversation that serves in the interest of public health, as the APA is now doing, directly contradicts the principles of medical ethics, as well as those of the World Medical Association’s 1948 Geneva Declaration, which clarified the humanitarian goals of medicine. Both of us have resigned from the APA—Leonard Glass, once a distinguished life fellow, did so in direct response to the association’s new interpretation of the Goldwater rule, and Bandy, once a fellow, did so more than a decade ago because of the association’s close ties with the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>It was with all of this in mind that Bandy, along with the psychiatrist James Gilligan, agreed to meet last month with a dozen members of Congress, all but one of them Democrats. (A former member had originally asked her to testify before all of Congress, but when this was delayed, a former assistant U.S. attorney arranged for her to meet with members individually.) By meeting with lawmakers, she was abiding by the APA’s ethical guidelines, which precede the Goldwater rule and instruct psychiatrists “to serve society by advising and consulting with the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches of the government.” In these meetings, she discussed purely medical matters without partisan affiliation or investment in a certain political outcome, which is for lawmakers to decide.</p><p>While the meetings were private and confidential, in general it’s fair to say the members themselves were forthright. “You don’t have to convince us. We have been so concerned ourselves. We were eager to meet with you,” was a common answer. One lawmaker said: “I have never so waited for a meeting in 11 years.” Several Democrats said they knew of Republican lawmakers who shared their concerns but could not express them publicly. They charged us to continue educating the public.</p><p>Any president’s mental health is inextricably tied to our health as a society, and, in this case, Trump’s mental state poses a serious danger that we must be willing to discuss and address. As Bandy told members of Congress, a few signs of this danger are: verbal aggressiveness, boasting about sexual assaults, inciting violence in others and the continual taunting of a hostile nation with nuclear weapons. Additional traits that are concerning are impulsiveness, recklessness, paranoia and rage reactions; a loose grip on reality with a poor understanding of consequences; a lack of empathy and belligerence toward others; and a constant need to demonstrate power. Trump’s recent tweet insisting he is a “very stable genius,” in response to claims about his mental capacity in a recent book by journalist Michael Wolff, confirmed our concerns about Trump: He appears not to perceive how critical any defect in his mental sharpness could be, or how imperative it is that he protect the country before his own reputation. </p><p>Cognitive function, or the ability to process knowledge and thoughts, is of critical importance for the office he holds, and its decline can be another danger sign. Some observers—including his own staff, according Wolff’s book—have noted a decline in Trump’s ability to form complete sentences, to stay with a thought, to use complex words and not to make loose associations. Only a thorough examination of Trump himself and his medical records, among other sources, could yield a diagnosis of these signs. Again, a diagnosis, prognosis and treatment are Trump’s private business and not ours. What is our business, as health professionals who have a duty to the public, is whether the president and commander in chief has the capacity to serve in office. Those questions are what mobilized us to speak out about our concerns in the first place, so that we can fulfill our duties to educate and to warn the public about an erratic and unstable leader, to help protect its and our own safety and well-being.</p><p>In early 20th-century Germany, the sociologist Max Weber argued that intellectuals should not utter any political opinions or say anything that could remotely be regarded as partisan—a Goldwater rule of sorts for the era. Under Nazism, not only psychiatrists but most German clergymen, professors, lawyers, doctors and other leading thinkers became passive enablers of some of the worst atrocities under a dangerous political leader who led their country into the worst disaster in its history. It was precisely in response to Nazism that the World Medical Association issued its Geneva Declaration. Seventy years later, we must not forget the declaration’s commitment to the common good, and cannot stay silent.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Republicans buoyed by their victory on a historic tax bill are turning their focus on the agency they might hate more than any other: the IRS.</p><p>But while conservatives have long wanted to deconstruct the tax collection bureaucracy, right now might be the worst possible time to continue to slash funding and roll back IRS powers. In the wake of the biggest rewrite of the tax code in three decades there will be a huge need to implement, explain and enforce hundreds of pages of new tax provisions in the coming years. </p><p>“Restructuring the IRS right now would be the worst thing for our country,” said Steve Mankowski, president of the National Conference of CPA Practitioners. “It’s just a recipe for disaster.”</p><p>National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, the agency's in-house watchdog, said Wednesday the IRS has tentatively estimated it needs an extra $495 million in funding for 2018 and 2019 to implement the tax law.</p><p>That’s not stopping House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas). Since 2016 he’s threatened to “bust up” the IRS, a vague plan he later refined to turning the IRS into a service-oriented agency for individual and business taxpayer needs, with dispute resolution handled through a small claims court-type of process.</p><p>“You’re going to see action this year on this issue,” Brady said Monday, adding that the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee that has already mined the issue would continue its work. “We’ll have some announcements shortly on some of the new process that they’ll be taking going forward, soliciting ideas from lawmakers and organizations as well.”</p><p>The oversight subpanel, which Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) chaired before switching to the Tax Policy Subcommittee in a change announced Wednesday, last year held five hearings on IRS customer service, improving taxpayer experiences, tax fraud, appeals and the agency’s antiquated computer systems.</p><br><p>Buchanan has said repeatedly that he wants to release an IRS restructuring bill early this year. But Brady said no timetable has been set on introducing legislation.</p><p>“I want to visit with the chairman about when the bill will be drafted and completed and ready for movement,” Brady said.</p><p>On Wednesday, Olson offered lawmakers 50 new recommendations as they consider a possible reorganization. The proposals are more administrative than structural, such as giving taxpayers more time to sue for damages if they’re unfairly targeted for collection and requiring that each state has a permanent IRS appeals officer.</p><p>Republicans seem in no hurry to give the agency more money, though Buchanan has said it's being discussed. Both the House and Senate bills that fund the IRS include more cuts.</p><p>If Brady, Buchanan and other Republicans get their way in changing IRS powers while also cutting agency funding, as they’ve done every year since 2010, it could undermine the new tax law President Donald Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill are boasting about.</p><p>First, it would further limit IRS call centers and other contact points for taxpayer inquiries, which have struggled to maintain service amid the budget cutbacks. Personnel numbers have declined, fewer questions are fielded year over year and only basic tax law answers have been given since the 2014 filing season, Olson has testified before Congress.</p><p>Shifting the IRS focus from implementation would also distract from developing new forms and tables that are needed to determine how much taxpayers owe. It would also hinder examinations and enforcement, which have suffered as appropriations have dwindled, as shown by reduced audit rates.</p><p>On top of that, it would make it harder to understand new international tax laws for U.S. companies that make money abroad or foreign firms that operate here; noncorporate businesses like partnerships and others known as pass-throughs also need clarity on new boundaries governing how their income will be taxed.</p><p>Even worse, some critics say, it would hamstring the federal government’s collection capability. Simultaneously withholding money from the IRS and restructuring its organization would surely distract from the agency’s revenue operations and leave money on the table that should be collected, Mankowski said.</p><p>Instead, agency veterans and others say Republicans who control Congress should sufficiently fund the IRS to ensure it has adequate resources to implement the new law and brace for taxpayer uncertainty.</p><p>“I do think that the service needs some additional funds in this instance,” said former IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson.</p><br><p>It’s in Republicans’ interest to work with the IRS during the implementation phase while continuing to hold the agency accountable, he added.</p><p>Extra money could be earmarked for specific purposes, similar to the nearly $300 million boost Congress provided the IRS in 2016, specifically for taxpayer services and combating identity theft, Mankowski said.</p><p>Ample appropriations would go a long way toward increasing the number of IRS employees who interact with taxpayers and professionals and ensuring staff is trained on the new law. Better funding would also help address challenges on the enforcement side of the agency, its outdated computer systems and its regulatory functions.</p><p>Those issues are more paramount than beginning what are certain to be slow changes for a major bureaucracy, said Everson, who headed the IRS from 2003 until 2007 and is now vice chairman at alliantgroup LP.</p><p>“I would operate carefully,” he said.</p><p>Others agreed.</p><p>“That could be a problem to institute massive reforms right now,” said former Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.), now a lobbyist at Capitol Counsel LLC and previously in the oversight role now held by Buchanan.</p><p>For his part, Buchanan has said talks are under way to raise the IRS funding level, possibly by as much as $500 million. As it stands now the agency’s budget is on track to decline to about $11.1 billion without anything extra, down from about $12.5 billion in 2010 when not adjusted for inflation.</p><p>“This is to help the transition,” Buchanan said last month, just after a ceremony marking the bill’s passage. “For payroll companies and everybody else, a lot of this has to get in place quickly, and the IRS is going to need additional funds to do that.”</p><br><p>Brady was less certain than Buchanan about increasing IRS funding for implementation.</p><p>“I don't know that,” Brady said. “The first question is, what do they need to implement this? And what of their current resources should be prioritized to that end?”</p><p>Other agency critics in Congress are even more outspoken. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a member of the tax-writing Finance Committee, isn't keen to supplement IRS funding because his anger hasn't subsided over the agency's political targeting scandal, which came to light in 2013.</p><p>“Only if they show us that they're going to impartially enforce the IRS code, and they proved that they couldn't enforce it, the way that they treated nonprofit organizations back in '11 and '12,” Grassley said, adding that he’s content to continue holding the agency's feet to the fire over the issue.</p><p>Congressional Republicans have for a while been tying to direct funding to specific IRS services and functions, Boustany said. But they ought to dial down their combative rhetoric in the meantime, he added.</p><p>“I hope that they do conduct a number of hearings that aren’t overtly political to really get down to what the needs are because I think this could be pretty disruptive going forward for a lot of American families, small businesses and of course on the corporate international side as well,” Boustany said.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) will not seek reelection, he announced Wednesday — the latest sign of a growing Democratic wave in this year’s midterm elections.</p><p>Issa is the second endangered California Republican to call it quits this week. Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also said he does not plan to seek reelection. </p><p>&quot;Throughout my service, I worked hard and never lost sight of the people our government is supposed to serve,&quot; Issa said in a statement. &quot;Yet with the support of my family, I have decided that I will not seek reelection in California's 49th District.&quot;</p><p>Issa, 64, was first elected to Congress in 2000. After the 2010 elections, he had become chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where he dedicated himself to investigating the Obama administration zealously. The Issa-led “Fast and Furious” investigation eventually led to an unprecedented House contempt vote against then-Attorney General Eric Holder in 2012. He was a key player in the GOP probe into the 2012 Benghazi attack, and Issa got national headlines for his role in investigating the IRS’ treatment of conservative nonprofit groups.</p><br><p>While these probes led to much praise from the right, they made Issa a target for the left. And the political environment in his Southern California district, once a reliably red seat based in Orange and San Diego counties, shifted rapidly in recent years: Issa barely survived the 2016 election — even stooping to using outgoing President Barack Obama’s image in a campaign flyer — while Hillary Clinton carried the traditionally Republican seat in the presidential election by 7 points. Democrats had targeted Issa for defeat in 2018.</p><p>&quot;Two retirements in the heart of the Orange County, behind the Orange Curtain, that could be hugely motivating right now for Democrats who are trying to retake Congress,” said Paul Mitchell, a consultant with Political Data, the voter data firm used by both Republicans and Democrats in California. “It's like getting a small victory before halftime because this will lead fundraising emails around the country in the next 24 hours.” </p><p>Issa grew up in Cleveland, the son of an X-ray technician. He dropped out of high school, then entered the U.S. Army. After leaving the service, Issa attended college.</p><p>In the 1980s, Issa put all his money — $7,000 — into a car-alarm business. He eventually became CEO of Directed Electronics and moved it to California, leading to “become the nation’s largest manufacturer of vehicle anti-theft devices, including the highly successful Viper system,” according to Issa’s official bio. Issa’s estimated net worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>By the early 1990s, Issa had become active in California politics. He ran for Senate in 1998, dropping nearly $10 million in an unsuccessful challenge to then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). When a House seat came open in the San Diego area the following cycle, Issa used his own money to help him win a crowded GOP primary, and he easily won the general election in 2000. He won reelection by comfortable, if not overwhelming, margins until 2016’s near-death experience.</p><p>For Republicans, holding Issa's seat — along with the other six GOP-held districts Clinton carried in 2016 — will be expensive. Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer announced this week that he plans to spend $30 million on flipping House seats, singling out Issa as a top target. </p><p>Issa had already drawn four well-funded Democratic challengers: Doug Applegate, a veteran and attorney who lost to Issa in 2016; Sara Jacobs, a former Obama administration official endorsed by the powerful group EMILY’s List; Paul Kerr, a real estate investor who outraised Issa last quarter; and Mike Levin, an attorney.</p><br><p>Several Republican candidates have already started testing the waters for a run. Assemblyman Bill Brough said he’s “considering running,” while local Republican operatives floated several other potential names, including Diane Harkey, a member of the California Board of Equalization; state Assemblyman Rocky Chavez; San Diego County Supervisor Kristin Gaspar; and Scott Baugh, a former Orange County GOP chairman. </p><p>All the candidates will run together in the June 5 primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the general election in November, regardless of party.</p><p>Republicans are hopeful about their chances to maintain the seat, citing the glut of well-funded Democratic candidates and internal polling showing generic candidates from each party running neck-and-neck.</p><p>&quot;In the 49th District, Democrats are locked in what is fast becoming one of the bloodiest primaries in America,&quot; said Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the chairman of the House GOP's campaign arm. &quot;While Democrats fight with each other, Republicans will focus on fighting Democrats — and that's how we plan to win.&quot;</p><br>",

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Wednesday for releasing congressional testimony on a controversial dossier alleging secret ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. </p><p>&quot;The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace,&quot; the president tweeted. &quot;Must have tough Primary!&quot;</p><p>Trump on Twitter Wednesday also dismissed the notion he or his campaign colluded with Russian officials, calling it &quot;the single greatest Witch Hunt in American history.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, &amp; yet on and on it goes,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!&quot;</p><br><p>Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the 312-page transcript of remarks given by Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, whose firm commissioned the dossier, to congressional investigators. </p><p>The surprise move angered Republicans on the panel, who had agreed not to released the remarks<b>, </b>but she defended her decision Wednesday as necessary for transparency.</p><p>&quot;I think, very often, things that happen that no one ever sees can be used for all kinds of mysterious and bad purposes,&quot; Feinstein told reporters. </p><p>She also dismissed the notion that she was already facing a tough primary battle ahead of her re-election next year, when Feinstein, the oldest currently serving senator, will be 85. </p><p>&quot;I could, I suppose,&quot; be facing a difficult primary, Feinstein said. &quot;I don't know, not yet.&quot;</p><p>And she scoffed at Trump's portrayal of her move as politically motivated: &quot;Oh, come on. Come on. ... Do you believe that? Of course not.&quot;</p><p>The transcript revealed Simpson had told lawmakers last summer the FBI had found the dossier to be credible due to an undisclosed &quot;human source&quot; in Trump's orbit that had corroborating information on its the explosive claims. </p><p>Fusion GPS co-founders Simpson and Peter Fritsch called for the Senate panel to released the full transcript of the testimony, chiding Republicans for selectively unveiling portions of it. </p><p>A spokesman for the firm said Tuesday they commended Feinstein &quot;for her courage&quot; in releasing the document. </p><br><p>Feinstein is facing a credible Democratic challenger this year: outgoing state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León. But California does not have traditional partisan primaries. Instead, all the candidates will run together on June 5, and the top two finishers will advance to the November general election, regardless of party.</p><p>Republicans have yet to land a high-profile recruit for the race, and it’s possible Feinstein and de León could face each other again in the general election.</p><p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi jokingly congratulated Feinstein for being given a moniker by Trump. </p><p>&quot;Congratulations to California’s own @SenFeinstein on officially earning her own @realDonaldTrump nickname. Clearly doing something right!&quot; Pelosi wrote. </p><p>Trump has dubbed various current and former government officials with jeering nicknames, including &quot;Crooked&quot; Hillary Clinton, &quot;Cryin'&quot; Chuck Schumer, &quot;Liddle&quot; Bob Corker and &quot;Sloppy&quot; Steve Bannon.<b> </b></p><p><i>Elana Schor and Steven Shepard contributed to this report. </i><br></p><br>",

The president made the remarks during an extended meeting with congressional Republicans and Democrats who are weighing a shorter-term agreement that would extend legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. The 90-minute session — more than half of which played out on national television — appeared to produce some progress: Mr. Trump agreed to a framework for a short-term immigration deal to couple protection for young, undocumented immigrants with border security. But in suggesting that a broader immigration measure was possible next, Mr. Trump was giving a rare public glimpse of an impulse he has expressed privately to advisers and lawmakers — the desire to preside over a more far-reaching solution to the status of the 11 million undocumented immigrants already living and working in the United States. Passage of a comprehensive immigration law would give Mr. Trump success where Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush failed.” </p><p><b>HAPPENED OVERNIGHT:</b><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/trump-dreamers-daca-judge-333143?lo=ap_b1\" target=\"_blank\"> From POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: </a>“A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's effort to shut-down the Obama-era program that provides quasi-legal status and work permits to foreigners who entered the U.S. illegally as children. In a ruling Tuesday evening, San Francisco-based U.S. District Court judge William Alsup ordered the administration to resume accepting renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA. … Unless halted by a higher court, the ruling will allow former DACA recipients who failed to renew by an October 5 deadline a chance to submit renewal applications and will also require the administration to allow renewal of applications expiring in the future. The decision does not require officials to accept new applications for DACA status. If the judge's order remains in place, it could also roil ongoing legislative efforts on DACA by undercutting the urgency many advocates have expressed, calling for legislation to be passed before large numbers of Dreamers begin losing their protected status in March.” </p><p><b>THE MEETING’S OTHER PURPOSE:</b> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fifty-five-minutes-at-the-table-trump-tries-to-negotiate-and-prove-stability/2018/01/09/0b41af64-f570-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_trumpdebrief-805pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.99c0aae7e852\" target=\"_blank\">From the Washington Post’s Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker: </a>“He acted the part, listening intently and guiding the conversation with the control of a firm but open-minded executive. He spoke the part, offering a mix of jesting bon mots and high-minded appeals for bipartisanship. And he looked the part, down to the embroidered ’45’ on his starched white shirt cuff. In short, President Trump on Tuesday tried to show that he could do his job. With his afternoon immigration meeting with lawmakers — into which he invited the press corps to watch for nearly an hour — Trump sought to definitively answer the question that has been nagging at him for the past week: Is the 71-year-old mentally fit to be commander in chief?” </p><p><b>THE DAVOS TRIP:</b> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/trump-davos-switzerland-economic-forum-331063\" target=\"_blank\">From POLITICO’s John F. Harris and Ben White:</a> “The annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will be choking with the kind of people who disdain Donald Trump and genuinely regard his presidency as a menace to the planet. In other words: exactly the kind of party Trump loves to crash. Lots of very rich people. Lots of media. Lots of fevered what-is-he-really-up-to speculation. At the psychological level, the appeal of Davos for Trump is obvious. The startling — though, in some ways, eye-rollingly logical — news on Tuesday that Trump will join all manner of global financial, political and media elites in their famed alpine lair later this month was for months quietly in the making, administration officials said. WEF organizers had been lobbying for months for high-level administration participation, though they hadn’t been counting on more than a few Cabinet secretaries. What planners didn’t know was that some West Wing advisers were arguing that Davos would be the perfect venue for Trump to unleash an especially gassy stink bomb aimed at ideas — free trade deals, a more integrated global regulatory system, and all manner of liberal pieties cherished by global elites — he deplores. One constant of Trump’s rise to power is his desire to command the attention, if not the approval, of the very establishment institutions he claims to be contemptuous of. No surprise that news of Trump’s Davos attendance was first leaked Tuesday morning to The New York Times, which Trump denounces and gives interviews to in seemingly equal measure. Trump’s controversial closing ad of the 2016 campaign featured video of GOP boogeyman George Soros speaking at a WEF event and included Trump railing against a ‘global power structure’ that was crushing the American worker.” </p><p><b>BANNON OUT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/bannon-steps-down-from-breitbart-news-329603\" target=\"_blank\">From POLITICO’s Michael Calderone, Jason Schwartz and Alex Isenstadt:</a> “Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon stepped down Tuesday as executive chairman of Breitbart News, a swift and stunning fall for a leading figure on the American right who was recently rebuked by President Donald Trump and abandoned by his key financial backer. Trump publicly broke with Bannon in dramatic fashion last week, suggesting his former top adviser had ‘lost his mind’ in response to critical comments Bannon made about members of the Trump family and campaign in Michael Wolff’s incendiary new book, ‘Fire and Fury.’” <br></p><br>",

It doesn't bother me at all.”</p><br><p>A spokesperson for Flake did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>In announcing his decision, Arpaio said he was motivated to run in part by a desire to support President Donald Trump. Flake has been perhaps the president's loudest Republican critic.</p><p>Flake was also critical of Trump' decision last August to pardon Arpaio after his contempt of court conviction, which stemmed from the then-sheriff’s defiance of a court order to end what a judge ruled to be racial profiling of Latinos. In announcing the pardon, a White House statement noted Arpaio’s “life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.”</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>SEOUL, South Korea — It's been more than a decade since the leaders of the two Koreas have held a summit. Could it happen now?</p><p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in told reporters Wednesday that he remains open to a meeting with North Korea's leader, if it would improve the strained relations between their two countries and help resolve the global standoff over the North's nuclear weapons development.</p><p>It's not a new position for Moon, who took office in May, but it took on new meaning coming one day after high-level officials from the two Koreas held a rare and apparently successful meeting, agreeing on the North's participation in the upcoming Winter Olympics in the South.</p><p>A meeting between the two leaders isn't likely in the immediate future. The North's Kim Jong Un hasn't met any foreign leader since he succeeded his father in 2011, and attitudes have hardened since the only two previous Korean summits in 2000 and 2007, when South Korean presidents were pursuing a &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; of trying to win over the North through engagement and aid.</p><br><p>Moon is a liberal who favors a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue and whose election ended nine years of hard-line conservative rule. He was chief-of-staff to former President Roh Moo-hyun, who held the last summit with Kim's father in 2007.</p><p>Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul, said a meeting during Moon's five-year term is possible.</p><p>&quot;Kim has never met any foreign leader, so it would be meaningful for him to make his first summit a meeting between Koreans,&quot; Koh said.</p><p>During the televised news conference in Seoul, Moon said &quot;I keep myself open to any meeting including a summit,&quot; and that he would push for further talks and cooperation after Tuesday's meeting.</p><p>&quot;To have a summit, some conditions must be established,&quot; he said. &quot;I think a certain level of success must be guaranteed.&quot;</p><p>Moon called North Korea's participation in next month's Olympics &quot;very desirable,&quot; but said inter-Korean relations cannot be improved without progress on the nuclear issue. He warned that the North would face harsher international sanctions and pressure if it resorts to new provocations, adding that &quot;denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the path to peace and our goal.&quot;</p><p>Under the deal struck Tuesday at the border village of Panmunjom, North Korea will send officials, athletes, cheerleaders, journalists and others to the Olympics in Pyeongchang, a mountainous county near the border. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Wednesday he expects the delegation will include 400 to 500 people. The accord stipulates the two Koreas will actively cooperate in the Olympics to &quot;enhance the prestige of the Korean people.&quot;</p><p>The two sides also agreed to hold military talks, and North Korea said it had recently restored a military hotline with the South, the second reopening of an inter-Korean communication channel in about a week, according to South Korean officials. All major communications had been shut down because of the tensions over the North's nuclear program.</p><p>The accords, reached at the first meeting between the rival Koreas in about two years, were widely viewed as a positive step following a year of escalating tension over Kim's rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs. Last year, Kim and President Donald Trump exchanged bellicose rhetoric and crude insults as North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and three tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that put the U.S. within its range.</p><p>Trump contended that his tough stance had helped persuade the North to sit down with the South, and Moon said during Wednesday's news conference that he feels thankful to the U.S. president for helping make the talks happen.</p><p>Some warn that tensions could quickly flare again as the North still wants to expand its weapons arsenal. They also say Kim may be pushing for better ties with South Korea because North Korea is feeling the pain of U.S.-led international sanctions.</p><br><p>The countries have a long history of failing to follow through with rapprochement accords. In 2015, negotiators met for nearly 40 hours before announcing a deal to pull back from a military standoff caused by land mine blasts that maimed two South Korean soldiers. But animosities flared again several months later after the North Korea's fourth nuclear test.</p><p>John Delury, a China and North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, cautioned that the process is fragile, but said Tuesday's talks are opening up new diplomatic possibilities, in striking contrast to last year.</p><p>&quot;It's still very early in this process, and we have to see how much momentum it acquires, but so far this year is definitely getting off to a very different start,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to knock on the door to see if it will open.&quot;</p><p>Two earlier liberal presidents, Roh and his predecessor Kim Dae-jung, met with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. But the conservative governments that followed them took a tougher line.</p><p>The presidency of conservative Lee Myung-bak, from 2008 to 2013, was marked by animosity, including North Korean attacks on a warship and a border island that together killed 50 South Koreans in 2010. His successor, Park Geun-hye, indefinitely suspended South Korean participation in a joint industrial park in North Korea's Kaesong city in February 2016, the last remaining major symbol of cooperation between the two.<br></p><br>",

But it could all come unglued in 2018 with a flare-up in North Korea, a White House-sparked trade war or a big run up in deficits.</p><p>“They’ve had a lot of luck so far. We, in our first few years and for a long time, there was a crisis that exploded that you just had to deal with,” Lew said from his office at investment firm Lindsay Goldberg in midtown Manhattan. “The world is on the edge right now but is not breaking through on most of those issues. The question is what happens if one of those crises actually switches from being potential to real.” </p><p>Lew suggested that markets, which continue to hit new records under Trump, may have developed too much of an assumption that placid conditions will continue.</p><p>“The thing I don’t have a good explanation for is the tolerance the markets have developed for uncertainty that used to rattle them more than it does now,” said Lew, who previously served as White House chief of staff and budget director.</p><p>“You look at the number of things where it’s kind of binary — whether things are really good or really bad, whether it’s North Korea, the possibility of trade wars, future deficits in the U.S. — the range of issues that have in the past made markets nervous, it seems they are kind of treated as a new normal.”</p><p>Lew also spoke about the 2016 election and how he feared Hillary Clinton was headed to a crushing loss.</p><br><p>“I had a bad feeling before the election,” he said. “I can’t say I expected it, but I can’t say I was completely surprised. I did not treat it as a done deal. The fact that President Obama went to Michigan on a rather urgent basis just a few days before the election was a bit of a canary in the coal mine that things weren’t where they needed to be.”</p><p>Lew stayed in Washington on election night to monitor potential market reaction to a Trump win. And he tried to boost spirits at the White House — including Obama’s — the day after.</p><p>“I went into work the next day, I went to the White House to the morning meeting, I went to Treasury to the morning meeting,” Lew said. “And I tried to kind of buoy people’s spirits with a bit of a historical recollection, that a lot of them who were younger than me hadn’t experienced crushing election outcomes. And the country survived and we survived and the pendulum swung back. You take two steps forward, you take a step back.”</p><br>",

And fewer than a third think Trump is likely to leave office in the coming year, despite calls from some Democrats for his impeachment.</p><p>But the first survey of 2018 isn’t all good news for the administration: Pluralities of voters expect Democrats, who have a significant lead on the congressional generic ballot, to win control of both the House and Senate in the midterm elections.</p><p>Voters’ predictions for Trump in 2018 are divided sharply along partisan lines, the polls show.</p><p>“Democrats and Republicans have drastically different views on whether Trump will be cleared of wrongdoing in the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller,” said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult’s co-founder and chief research officer. “Three in four Republicans, 74 percent, say it’s likely Trump will be cleared of wrongdoing in the Russia probe this year. But only 32 percent of Democrats say the same.”</p><p>Voters are more evenly split on whether Mueller’s investigation will ensnare a member of Trump’s family. Just over four in 10, 41 percent, say it’s at least somewhat likely a member of Trump’s family will be indicted on criminal charges in the next year, compared with 46 percent who say that is unlikely.</p><p>Only 32 percent say Trump is very or somewhat likely to leave office in 2018 — including, in perhaps some wishful thinking, 51 percent of Democrats. But a 56 percent majority think it’s not too likely or not at all likely.</p><br><p>While most voters are fairly confident Trump’s presidency will survive 2018, they see possible Democratic gains in this year’s midterms. Fully 45 percent of voters think it’s at least somewhat possible Democrats win back the House, while only 38 percent say that’s not too likely or not at all likely.

        "content": "<p>Democrats are going on the offensive on Russia. </p><p>The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday ramped up pressure on the Trump administration to slap new sanctions on Russia, releasing a massive report — written without GOP involvement — that details President Vladimir Putin’s alleged electoral meddling around the world. </p><p>That came one day after another senior Democratic senator <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/feinstein-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-329573\" target=\"_blank\">abruptly released</a> the transcript of an interview with a key player in the investigation looking into any ties between President Donald Trump and Russia's interference.</p><p>And across the Capitol, a half-dozen House Democrats <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/democrats-accuse-republicans-ignoring-russia-329597\" target=\"_blank\">banded together</a> to push Republicans for a more comprehensive response to Russian disruption of the 2016 election, warning that Moscow will again meddle with the democratic process. </p><br><p>Democrats, frustrated by conservative attempts to undercut the investigation into Trump’s ties to Moscow and growing convinced that Republicans aren’t taking electoral security seriously, are increasingly tired of waiting on their colleagues in the majority to act and are taking their concerns public. </p><p>“We must counter Russia’s well-established election interference playbook,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a floor speech billed as puncturing “partisan efforts to deflect attention and distract from critical inquiries” into Moscow’s attempts to upend the 2016 election. </p><p>“Russia will hack. Russia will bully. Russia will propagandize,” he said. </p> <p>Sen. Ben Cardin’s staff on the Foreign Relations Committee extensively detailed that alleged behavior by Putin’s network in the report Wednesday, which does not address special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe but repeatedly slams Trump for a laggard response that it says puts U.S. security at risk. </p><p>“President Trump is squandering an opportunity to lead America’s allies and partners to build a collective defense against the Kremlin’s global assault on democratic institutions and values,” the report states. “But it is not too late.”</p><p>Among the report's two dozen-plus recommendations is a call for the Trump administration to implement a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill. Lawmakers in both parties raised alarms after the administration missed an October deadline to designate potential targets for new sanctions, and belated compliance came only after a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/26/trump-russia-sanctions-delay-bob-corker-244215\" target=\"_blank\">nudge</a> from Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).</p><br><p>The next critical deadline is Jan. 29, the earliest date that companies could face penalties for engaging in &quot;significant transactions&quot; with targets in the Russian defense or intelligence sectors. The sanctions bill also asks the Treasury Department to give Congress a series of reports by the end of this month, including one on Russian oligarchs who could face future sanctions and their connections to Putin, and another on the effect of expanding sanctions to Moscow's sovereign debt.</p><p>One Democratic aide on the Foreign Relations Committee said the minority would be &quot;waiting and seeing&quot; how the administration treats the required Russian oligarch list as a test of its commitment to sanctions implementation.</p><p>&quot;If there’s, like, two names on it, then they’re probably not taking it very seriously,&quot; the aide told reporters. </p><p>Other Democratic proposals to safeguard against future electoral disruption by Putin include placing FBI investigators in embassies and disclosing intelligence about the Russian leader’s “personal corruption and wealth stored abroad.”</p><p>Democratic staffers on the Foreign Relations panel were optimistic that the report would win some Republican buy-in after its Wednesday release, much as the package of Russia sanctions drew widespread GOP support even as Trump continued to publicly deny that Moscow intervened in the 2016 election. </p><p>“A lot of Republicans have been publicly critical of how Trump has handled the Russia issue specifically,” one aide told reporters.</p><p>Corker said Tuesday that he would &quot;look at the whole&quot; Russia report, adding that he and Cardin (D-Md.) &quot;have a very good relationship. He knew it was probably not something that I’d want to be a part of, but he made me aware of it.&quot;</p><p>A spokeswoman for Corker, a lead author of last year's Russia sanctions legislation, said in a statement that Corker &quot;appreciates the fact that Senator Cardin previously notified him&quot; of the Democratic report, which he received a copy of late Monday. &quot;While we will review the report in its entirety, including the recommendations, no further full committee activity is planned at this time.”</p><p>Republicans say they are working on election security ahead of the midterms, and the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee are expected to provide recommendations on the matter before the primary season begins.<br> <br>Eight House Republicans and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) already have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/18/facebook-ad-disclosure-bill-243914\" target=\"_blank\">signed on to</a> legislation that would codify one recommendation in the Cardin report, which proposes that social media companies require disclosure of the funding sources behind political ads on their platforms to prevent Russian attempts at manipulation. Still, the prospects for movement on that measure appear grim at present given the scant number of GOP backers.</p><br><p>If Republicans did get on board with Cardin's report, that would mark a stark contrast with the partisan conflagration that erupted Tuesday on the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Top Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California released the transcript of the panel's August interview with Glenn Simpson, whose company was behind an explosive dossier tying Trump to the Kremlin.

        "content": "<p>It might sound like a commonplace, but if we want American adults to be healthier in the future, we should invest in children today. The food we eat when we’re young, the air we breathe, even our social and emotional environment, all shape the development of our bodies and minds. Poor children start out with a health disadvantage from the beginning, breathing dirtier air, drinking tainted water, eating inferior food, studying in bad schools which they leave sooner, and in general growing up with more stress and fewer opportunities. All of these factors have been shown to harm their physical health in the short and the long run. Poor children turn into unhealthy adults.</p><p>But what’s the most effective way to fight the health effects of poverty? That answer isn’t as obvious. The U.S. welfare system, which should combat poverty and its adverse effects, focuses primarily on ensuring that only the deserving poor receive aid. It employs stringent systems to assess eligibility for every program designed to help the poor. Conditions are attached on parental behavior, such as work requirements. And most support is in-kind: Instead of cash, the U.S. prefers to offer food to the hungry, and health insurance to the uninsured, etc. These policies seek to keep program costs down. But in the end, the U.S. has among the highest child poverty rates in the developed world, with almost 1 in 5 children growing up in poverty.</p><p>There’s another philosophy, which is to just give poor families cash. This sounds more like the older model of welfare, one that American policymakers have moved away from, worried that the system was abused by adults and the money wasted, rather than used to help kids.</p><p>But does it really get wasted? It is a difficult thing to test, but we analyzed the results of a past U.S. welfare program, and the answer is unequivocal: Giving cash to poor families is really, really good for children.</p><br><p>I’m an economist, and I’ve crunched the numbers on “the Mother’s Pension Program,” a cash-based welfare program begun in 1911. It might seem odd to look at a social program more than a century old to draw lessons for today. Most of the recipients are long dead. But that’s actually why looking at the Mother’s Pension Program is so valuable: we can track the impact of the program over the course of the recipients’ entire lifespans using census, military and other government data. And there’s even a comparison group: Some families were rejected from the program mostly because their incomes were a bit too high to qualify. We can use children in these families to assess how they fared over the course of their lives relative to those who received cash. They did not do as well.</p><p>The Mother’s Pension Program grew out of an investigation into the effects of poverty on children begun by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. At the time, children whose families could not support them were sent to orphanages. Slowly, the press and policymakers came to realize that even highly imperfect parents are far better than institutions at raising children: Children in orphanages were malnourished, with high mortality rates. Charities couldn’t provide for all of them. From this rose the Mother’s Pension Program, the first cash-transfer program in U.S. history, aimed at helping poor families with young children. It was adopted by almost all states from 1911 to 1930.</p><p>The typical family in the Mother’s Pension Program had about four children and received cash equivalent to about 30 percent of its total income for about three years – a relatively short period of time in a child’s life, but far more money than today’s levels of welfare support (which in most states is less than 30 percent of the federal poverty level, not of total income).</p><p>To understand its long-term effects, we matched more than 16,000 administrative records from the program to death certificates, 1940 census records and World War II enlistment records and compared the lives of children in the recipient families with the lives of the children whose families were turned down. We found that on average, children in recipient families lived one to two years longer. When the boys enlisted in WWII, they were less likely to be underweight. They also had higher levels of education and incomes. So in addition to being healthier than their peers whose families didn’t get extra cash, these children grew into more educated, higher-earning adults, too.</p><br><p>Was it worth the cost to taxpayers? A simple computation shows that the program’s rate of return is very high. The current federal poverty level for a family of five (the average family size of the typical recipient family at the time) is $28,780 in current dollars. Compare this cost with its benefit: An additional year of life for each of the four children in the family receiving the transfer. The lowest estimated value of a year of life is about $75,000. Thus, the life-extension benefits alone have a value of $300,000 — 10 times larger than a $28,780 transfer. A full cost-benefit analysis would include other costs (like administrative costs and work disincentives) and other benefits (like the additional taxes paid by higher-earning adults and their lower health care costs). But these numbers make it all but certain that the program brought a very high return.</p><p>Some worry that giving cash to the poor is a waste because the parents will not spend it wisely. But our research shows that on average, poor mothers used the money to improve their children’s lives. We do not know what they did with the cash — those records weren’t kept — but we do know their children were ultimately better off as a result of the transfer. This makes intuitive sense: Money is far more flexible than goods, vouchers or subsidies, and gives parents the chance to purchase whatever might be needed for the child. In the 1910s, that might have been a school uniform. Today, it might be internet access. It could go toward family expenditures (to fix the car, or move to a better neighborhood), or even to help the parents with something they need — since a child’s wellbeing is inextricably tied to that of his parents. Giving money, rather than offering in-kind goods and services, lets families use the money in the way that helps them most — and our research shows that on average, that’s what they did.</p><p>If you look at the overall economics of the current system, you quickly see that it isn’t just inefficient, it’s also expensive. In order to help only the truly needy without giving them cash, the U.S. has created a large and administratively complex government system: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; Medicaid; food stamps; WIC (a program for women, infants and children); the Department of Housing and Urban Development; etc. Each of these programs has its own administration, eligibility guidelines and application processes. There is little coordination, a lot of duplication, a lot of hassle and a lot of waste. And still many needy families are not receiving help.</p><br><p>The U.S. has one of the highest poverty rates among industrialized countries, uniquely providing the least assistance to poor families with children, mostly in-kind rather than in cash. Let’s take a lesson from our past: It’s simpler, easier and more effective to provide cash assistance to poor families, and we know it will pay for itself many times over by raising the education, incomes and lifelong health of future generations.</p><p><i>Adriana Lleras-Muney is a professor of economics at the University of California-Los Angeles.</i></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Americans spend $5,000 more per year on medical care than people in other rich countries, yet live shorter and less healthy lives. Most efforts devoted to addressing health involve the medical system: covering more people, changing the flow of dollars to providers, reducing administrative expenses and the like. But medical care is largely focused on helping people who are sick. What’s the best way to prevent them from getting sick in the first place?</p><p>I have come to believe that the most cost-effective dollar in health is the one spent on education. There are good economic arguments to be made for a number of different types of nonhealth spending that will improve people’s health, such as cleaning up the environment or lowering the price of healthy food. But the effects of these policies go only so far. Subsidizing healthy food might help people’s weight, but can’t keep them from smoking, drinking, or overdosing on opioids. Education, by contrast, addresses the entire panoply of adverse health behaviors.</p><p>Behavior is the key. When we compare geographic regions, the dominant factor driving health differences is how Americans behave. Unhealthy areas smoke more, drink more and eat to excess; healthier areas avoid these behaviors. Adverse health behaviors account for 40 percent of deaths in the United States. Reduce those deaths and the population can live much longer. By every metric measured, more educated people have healthier behaviors than less educated people. More educated people smoke less, weigh less, and are less likely to drink to excess. They wear seat belts more regularly, receive more preventive care, and take chronic care medications more faithfully. As a result, morbidity and mortality are lower for those with more education. And the relationship is strong: Every year of education adds to health. People with an associate’s degree are healthier than those who ended education at high school, and four-year college graduates are healthier still.</p><p>Indeed, the benefits of education seem to spread even beyond the person with the education. Research suggests that living in an area with better educated people has spillovers for everyone. The share of an area’s population with a college degree is a better predictor of life expectancy for low-income people — very few of whom have any post-high school education — than the share of people in the area who are insured or the share who are religious.</p><p>There is also good evidence that the relationship between education and health is causal, not just a coincidence. Interventions that increase the amount of education people receive also improve their health. Early in the 20th century, states increased the minimum age at which people could leave school, typically from 15 to 17. Cohorts required to stay in school longer had lower mortality than cohorts who were allowed to leave school younger.</p><br><p>A century ago, staying in high school was the goal. Today, it’s achieving higher education. Still, the results hold into the modern era as well. Men who were eligible for education benefits under the Korean War GI bill experienced less depression in late life than men from similar socioeconomic backgrounds but who were not eligible for benefits. Men who enrolled in college to avoid being drafted in the Vietnam War realized significant health gains as a result. And women who grew up in areas where community colleges have opened have healthier babies than women who grew up in areas without community colleges, and than women in those same areas before the community colleges opened.</p><p>At least part of the better health for the women growing up in areas with community colleges was behavioral: They smoked less and used more prenatal care.</p><p>The issue is not just post-high school education. Pre-kindergarten education matters as well. Pre-K education is associated with increased detection of vision and hearing problems in low-income children, reduced rates of smoking and excessive alcohol intake as these children become adults, and improved mental health and overall health status into middle age. The evidence is overwhelming that education is the best prevention.</p><p>All this means that at least part of the answer to improving Americans’ health in the future (and reining in the high costs of their health care) should be to invest more in education now.</p><p>So, how could we spend education money most effectively to improve Americans’ health? Here are a few ideas.</p><p>The federal government currently spends about $50 billion annually subsidizing higher education, through Pell Grants and tuition tax credits. Still, rates of post-secondary attendance remain low. Only one-third of high school students in a low socioeconomic status group will achieve any post-high school degree, compared with two-thirds of kids in a high socioeconomic status group. Controlling for other factors affecting academic performance diminishes these differences, but the remaining gap is still enormous. The bottom line is that too few high-ability students go on to post-secondary education. Investing in their education would pay off in the future in better health and lower health care costs, not just for them but also for their families and communities.</p><br><p>There are several ways to do this. One easy option would be to simplify the complex process involved in financial aid applications. The complexity of the current financial aid process discourages many needy students from applying for federal collegiate aid.</p><p>Still, more support is needed to lower the cost of higher education. Higher education costs have soared while government aid has fallen. It is no wonder so many students have difficulty affording higher education. One could expand Pell Grants and tuition tax waivers to help meet this need, but expecting a haphazard program to reach ever-more students is difficult. At some point, it becomes easier to have a universal education program than an increasingly more complex means-tested one.</p><p>In the 2016 presidential election, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders famously proposed making four-year public colleges free for people in families earning below $125,000 annually and community colleges free for everyone. Sanders drew most of the attention, but the proposal for at least some form of free higher education predates him. In 2015, President Barack Obama proposed making community colleges free for all students who maintained a minimum GPA. And Obama’s proposal was itself based on a program in Tennessee that fully covers tuition in the state’s community colleges for all Tennessee residents (and which has since expanded to Oregon and Minnesota). Sanders estimated that his proposal would cost $75 billion annually; Obama’s proposal would have cost $20 billion annually (including federal and state contributions).</p><p>Estimates suggest that universal pre-K education would cost an additional $25 billion annually, though this could be pared by limiting eligibility to families below a certain income level.</p><p>Let’s suppose the federal government decides to spend $40 billion annually on an expanded education program at the pre-K and post-secondary levels. In the scale of federal spending on education, the amount is large; it is close to a doubling of current levels. But by the scale of health interventions, it is small. Federal spending on Medicaid is over $200 billion annually, Medicare is more than $600 billion annually, and health programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs are another $70 billion. The budget of the National Institutes of Health is about $30 billion. The point is not that medical spending or NIH research should be cut to pay for education spending. The point is that by any standard we underinvest in the long-term drivers of population health.</p><br><p>As we grapple with what comes next in health care, we ought to remember that the wisest health investments may be far removed from the delivery of medical services. When it comes to promoting good health, education is the best prevention.</p><p><i>David M.

        "content": "<p>When mothers arrive at Ruth Slocum’s parenting classes, she encourages them to sit on the floor and play with their babies as they talk about first foods or coping with sleep deprivation. She and her co-instructor offer bubbles to blow, and they snap pictures that the women can later turn into scrapbooks with materials they provide. During mothers-only sessions, the women talk about how to recognize and respond to a baby’s cues and how to manage “big feelings” of their own. Slocum’s immediate goal is to help them build a strong attachment with their child. But there's another, longer-term idea at work here: Research suggests that forging these bonds will ultimately prevent problems for these children that may seem a long, long way off, deep in their adulthood, problems like heart disease, stroke and depression. </p><p>Slocum’s parenting class on the Tulsa campus of Oklahoma State University isn’t meant just to help mothers weather the first uncertain weeks with a baby. It could be considered a novel form of inoculation.<b> </b>Medical professionals can vaccinate children against pathogens like polio or pertussis, but they have few tools to prevent the chronic illnesses that wreak havoc with so many adult lives and that cost the health care system so much to treat. What would it look like if we could somehow protect small children against those illnesses the way we vaccinate for tetanus or chicken pox? It might look something like the Legacy for Children parenting class Slocum teaches.<b> </b></p><p>Public health experts know that much of what makes adults unhealthy has roots in childhood, in the adversities that children experience as they are growing up — the absence of a parent, unstable housing, or a family member’s problems with drugs or alcohol can show up later as diabetes, drug and alcohol use, obesity, cancer and anxiety. The connection between childhood and later health cuts across society: While low-income children like the ones Slocum works with may on balance experience higher levels of adversity, few people are born into families or circumstances without the kinds of challenges that can have long-lasting effects on their health. </p><p>A growing body of research has looked at people who face adversities in childhood yet somehow grow up without serious problems or illnesses. A number of factors seem to help those children thrive, but some researchers say one factor stands out as the best possible protection against poor health: the presence of a consistent, caring relationship early in life.</p><br><p>Of course, a loving relationship can’t be prescribed in a doctor’s office, but experts say<b> </b>there are proven means of making those connections more likely to develop in families and across a community. And if, as a society, we really want to promote better health and uproot the causes of social ills like addiction and chronic illnesses like diabetes, the research suggests we must go back—way back, to the very start of the lives we want to improve. </p><p>A baby’s connection with its mother is “the architecture for all future relationships, including self-esteem and one’s own relationship to oneself,” said Slocum, mental health manager for the Tulsa Children’s Project. “It’s big.”</p><p><b>SCIENTISTS ARE STILL </b>figuring out exactly how early childhood stress influences health years later, but the evidence suggests that even the tiniest bodies—especially the tiniest bodies, it turns out—internalize stress, causing debilitating effects on organ and tissue function. </p> <p> “The only thing that we know that mitigates those physiological effects on the physical body is maternal warmth,” said Jennifer Hays-Grudo, director of the Center for Integrative Research on Childhood Adversity at Oklahoma State University. </p><p>Researchers suspect that childhood stress essentially embeds in immune cells, prompting long-lasting changes to how genes are expressed and causing the body to go into <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202072/\" target=\"_blank\">a chronic inflammatory state.</a> That is exacerbated by behavioral and hormonal effects that make it harder for people to regulate their emotions, increasing the likelihood that, as adults, they’ll find themselves in stressful situations and engaging in unhealthy behaviors. And we’re not just talking about social problems, we’re talking about diseases adults get decades later.</p><p>In fact, people who are exposed to adverse experiences in childhood—things like physical, emotional or sexual abuse, problem drinking, food insecurity, divorce or mental illness within the household—are far more likely to have serious health problems later in life, at a certain level doubling their risk of cancer, heart disease and stroke, quadrupling rates of depression, and increasing their likelihood of attempting suicide 12-fold. </p> <p> The correlation between these events and health problems later in life is so direct that researchers now count them, using a scoring questionnaire.<b> </b>Life expectancy for people who report six or more adverse childhood experiences, often shortened to ACEs, is estimated to be as much as 20 years shorter than for people who report none. Notably, while a lot of public health rightly focuses on racial and ethnic disparities, the study that first established a dosing relationship between ACEs and health—the more bad experiences you have in childhood, the worse off you are later in life—was based on a study of more than 9,500 people who were mostly white and largely college-educated. No one is born immune to these problems. </p><p>But there are mitigating factors. A 2011 study found that among adults who grew up in poverty, those who experienced high levels of maternal warmth as children had lower systemic inflammation and reduced immune -ell response to challenges. They suggested that having that kind of relationship may actually <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925055/\" target=\"_blank\">biologically protect</a> people from health consequences, including depression, later in life. </p><br><p>That’s some of the research that’s motivating the Legacy program and others like it. Programs that provide structured social support for parents and increase positive parent-child interactions could significantly improve the long-term health of participants, particularly for children living in poverty, according to an <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345847/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> published last year by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hays-Grudo, and others at Oklahoma State University. One key to such programs, the authors write, is that they treat parents as “frontline public health workers in the trenches of children’s health and development.”</p><p>“When children feel safe, especially in the first three or four years of life, they learn that they can trust their environment,” Hays-Grudo said in an interview. “They learn from their parents that they can trust other people, and they see the world as a safe and welcoming place where they can learn. Part of what they learn is to self-regulate, to not panic.” </p><p>It’s not only mothers who have a role to play. In a landmark study on adversity and resilience, researchers tracked nearly 700 infants born on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in 1955, following most of them for 40 years. About 30 percent of participants experienced poverty or other risk factors in childhood. And two-thirds of that group experienced behavioral problems, developed delinquency or grappled with mental illness by age 18. However, <a href=\"https://www.pathwaysrtc.pdx.edu/pdf/fpS0504.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one-third did not.</a> The resilient ones went on to perform well in school and at home. They maintained jobs and had lower rates of chronic health problems by age 40. Among several factors that seemed to protect them from the negative effects of their childhood were attentive mothers and affectionate bonds with “alternative caregivers.”</p><p>“Children who succeeded against the odds had the opportunity to establish, early on, a close bond with at least one competent, emotionally stable person who was sensitive to their needs,” researcher Emmy Werner<b> </b>wrote in 2005. “Much of this nurturing came from substitute caregivers, such as grandparents, older siblings, aunts, and uncles.” </p><p>Hays-Grudo and colleague Amanda Morris are now working on a second questionnaire, measuring protective and compensatory experiences, or PACEs, that could buffer the negative effects of adversity, based on resiliency research. The first question: “Did you have someone who loved you unconditionally?”</p><p>“That’s the most important one,” Hays-Grudo said, “so we put it first.”</p><br><p><b>RANDELL DEJESUS ALWAYS </b>liked riding bikes. He was 11 years old when he heard about a bike shop in Honolulu’s Kalihi Valley that was starting a cycling team. He began hanging out there, and the bike shop, it turned out, was much more than a bike shop. The Kalihi Valley Instructional Bike Exchange, or KVIBE, was started in 2005 by the local health center to promote exercise and healthy habits. It grew into a vibrant community center, where teens mentor one another on how to fix bikes—eventually they take their own bike home—and how to talk about their feelings. And importantly, building off the Hawaiian research, the bike shop works to connect teens with caring adults who can step in to provide stability and guidance to kids who need it. </p><p>Before he came to the shop, Dejesus said, talking about feelings was a foreign thing to him. But at KVIBE, he began participating in daily culture circles, where students and staff members check in with each other and with themselves. Now 16 and a senior intern, Dejesus often leads the circles. The shop has given him confidence, he said, and a mentor. Program Manager Kevin Faller, whom Dejesus calls “Kuya Kev,” using the Tagalog word for “older brother,” checks in on him nearly every day, even when Dejesus isn’t in the shop. Faller’s example has shown him how to be a kuya to other students, he said, and in his family, to his 2-year-old brother and 1-year-old nephew.</p><p>“It’s really inspiring to be with him,” Dejesus said of Faller, “because he’s always encouraging me to do good, to be the best version of myself, like he always says.” </p><p>Those relationships are a central part of what KVIBE provides, said Jeffrey Tangonan Acido, program manager for community education and civic engagement at the health center.<b> </b>“You just need one person in your whole life to have said, ‘I love you,’” Acido said. “That’s an intentional approach imbibed in our staff.” </p><p>KVIBE and Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services received $350,000 last year in grants from the Making Connections program of the Prevention Institute, based in Oakland, California, which focuses largely on building more resilient communities. Positive parenting programs are important, said Sheila Savannah, the institute’s director of mental health and well-being programs. But how do you make sure the benefits of a consistent, caring relationship reach a whole population of people, including children whose parents aren’t capable of supporting them or teens who pull away from their immediate family? Programs like KVIBE can help, she said. </p><p>In nearly every community “alternative caregivers” already are doing the work of supporting children who need them, but they may lack the knowledge or the tools they need to be most effective, said Altha Stewart, a community psychiatrist in Tennessee and the president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association. Stewart, whose work has focused largely on developing systems of care for children at risk of going into the juvenile justice system, speaks frequently at community meetings about the effects of ACEs. At many talks, she said, she hears from someone acting as a primary caregiver, such as a grandmother caring for her grandchild. </p><p>“Once she begins to put the pieces together and realizes that not only does this child have significant ACEs, her own child has significant ACEs, which probably contributed to their inability to parent, and that she herself is carrying around a significant number of ACEs, things start to click,” she said. “More than one time, I’ve heard an elderly grandparent say, ‘Now I get it.’”</p><br><p>She’s encouraged that, as awareness of ACEs grows, more people will look at the children once considered simply “bad kids” and instead ask, “What happened to you, and how can we help?” She and other public health experts say an increasing number of police departments and school systems are getting trauma-sensitivity training, and community organizations are evaluating what they can do to protect children from adversity in their <a href=\"http://www.rotaryfyi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">own neighborhoods</a>. And health care institutions are beginning to look further “upstream” to address underlying causes of chronic health conditions that are expensive to treat and could be avoided.</p><p><b>KAISER PERMANENTE, THE</b> largest integrated health plan and hospital system in the country, already invests in <a href=\"https://thrivingschools.kaiserpermanente.org/improving-mental-health-in-schools\" target=\"_blank\">school-based programs</a> meant to help children who experience adversity, through in-school mental health services and <a href=\"https://etnortherncalifornia.kaiserpermanente.org/resilience-squad\" target=\"_blank\">programs</a> that teach emotional regulation techniques. Donald Mordecai, a psychiatrist and the system’s national leader for mental health and wellness, said the health system is considering how to invest in earlier interventions, including measures to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to train parents of young children. </p><p>“There’s not a magic bullet here,” Mordecai said. “But can you put together a package that can address some of this?”</p><p>Persuading health care systems to invest in preventing ACEs—money, but also attention—is important, said Nadine Burke Harris, a pediatrician and founder of San Francisco’s Center for Youth Wellness, and a leading national voice on the issue. She believes every pediatrician should screen patients for adverse childhood experiences. At a minimum, she said, screening helps to educate parents about the long-term health effects their children can suffer from things that happen to them now. Too often, caregivers assume children simply won’t remember the bad things that surrounded them when they were young.</p> <p> “The science tells us the opposite,” Burke Harris said. “When children have the greatest neuroplasticity is between ages 0 and 5. When they experience these terrifying situations, it’s wired into their brain. … We have to get over this myth of childhood amnesia.”</p><p>As she speaks, it’s easy to sense Burke Harris’ frustration that more isn’t already being done—especially among her peers in pediatrics—when the evidence is clear: Violence, threat and deprivation don’t just harm children emotionally, they lead to asthma, diabetes and cancer, and exploding national health care costs. </p><p>“We have the capacity to fundamentally change our society when we do early detection,” she said. </p><p>Lessons on the wiring of the babies’ brain aren’t explicitly part of the program in Legacy for Children. But a conversation on responding to a baby’s cues might become one about how those positive interactions help a child manage his or her emotions later in life, and Slocum ends up talking about how neurons form in the brain in the first three years of life. </p><p>The class, she said, requires a lot of resources, including preparation time, meeting space, two well-trained instructors and commitment from the mothers who participate—so many resources that she doubts just how widely it could be implemented in its current form. </p><p>But then she talks to a mother who struggled with two older children and who says her connection to her third child, now in class, is different—stronger. When the baby needs something, she picks up on the signals. And the baby responds to her more, too. </p><p>“You get people like that and you’re thinking, ‘I’m so glad I’m doing this,’” she said. “We are really changing some lives.”</p><p><i>Chelsea Conaboy is a freelance writer and editor based in Portland, Maine</i>. </p><br>",

        "content": "<p>At the heart of America's vaunted health care system is a frustrating puzzle. The United States pays three times as much per citizen as the average of other wealthy nations—far more than even the second-highest spender, Switzerland, adding up to $3 trillion a year. Yet for all that enormous expenditure, we come in dead last among those nations in lifespan. And as the bills climb, our life expectancy is actually shrinking.</p><p>What’s going so wrong? If our national health care were a corporation, that return on investment would get its CEO immediately fired. Plenty of experts are ready to point fingers at various causes: our lack of universal health care, industrialized food system, suburban lifestyles, and profit-driven tangle of insurers and drug companies and hospitals. Surely those play a role. And yet other countries face each of these, and other challenges as well, and still manage to spend less and enjoy better health overall.</p><p>Looming over the American conversation about public health is a growing suspicion that there's a bigger reason for our uniquely poor showing, one that has been staring us in the face for years. It's an explanation rooted in one simple statistic: While we pay more for health care than any other country in the world, when it comes to spending on social services—education, subsidized housing, food assistance and more—we rank in the bottom 10 among developed countries.</p><p>It's easy to think of “health” as just another category of social-service spending. But a great deal of modern research suggests that it might be more accurate to think of it as the payoff of all the other services put together. Elizabeth Bradley, president of Vassar College and a former Yale researcher widely seen as the world's foremost expert in the relationship between social services and health, has documented how the ratio of a country's social-service spending to health care spending is highly correlated with health outcomes around the world. &quot;The right question for our political agenda is, 'What's going to give us the most bang for the buck in health outcomes?'&quot; says Bradley. &quot;What our work has shown is that the answer is spending on social services.&quot;</p><p>For a cost-conscious government ever wary of spending taxpayer money on public programs, this kind of expansive view of “health” sounds politically forbidding. But if you really care about health—and as a society, we clearly do, to the tune of $672 billion a year in Medicare, $565 billion in Medicaid, $329 billion raked in by the pharma industry and a $1 trillion by hospitals—there is good reason to believe that money pumped into social services would do more for our national health than money invested directly in health care. </p><br><p>In fact, it's possible to see America's astronomical health costs as a bill coming due from our reluctance to pay for everything else. &quot;We spend so much on health care because we're mopping up for our lack of investment in education, housing and other areas,&quot; says Corey Rhyan, an analyst at the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at health care think tank Altarum.</p><p>In public health, there's a buzzword for all these other factors: the &quot;social determinants of health,&quot; the complex set of home-and-community factors that shapes every American life. A simple way to think of it might be as looking &quot;upstream&quot; from health, toward the influences we encounter long before we need medical care to fix the problems they’ve caused. What if, instead of plowing more money into medicine, we could shift those?</p><p>Of course, that's not how our policy conversation has gone. When we debate housing services, or education spending, we rarely focus on their potentially huge downstream benefits on public health. And when we debate health care spending, we don't discuss the lack of “upstream” social services that has made much of that care necessary. </p><p>Why don't policymakers start looking further upstream? One problem is that it has been difficult to put hard numbers on the health care payback from social-service spending—and especially hard to get numbers relevant in the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of elected officials. But in recent years, economists and public-health experts have started to focus more on answering that question, trying to build an economic case for tackling health through upstream changes, instead of playing an expensive game of catch-up downstream. And the numbers are starting to come in, thanks to a growing range of innovative social-good programs that measure hard health care benefits, as well as a renewed effort on the part of academic researchers to give policymakers the data they need.</p><p>Five years ago those sorts of programs and tools were scarce. But more recently, they've quietly been arriving on the scene, driven in part by imaginative new approaches to what we should be measuring, and how. If these approaches work, they could start changing not only our policy conversation, but the politics around it, offering hard-headed evidence of savings that Republicans could get behind as easily as Democrats. The stakes couldn’t be higher: Last year health care passed retail as America’s largest industry, and our aging population makes it overwhelmingly likely that we’ll be shifting yet more of our GDP into medical spending for decades to come. If we wanted to start bending that curve right now, what levers should we really push?</p><p><b>IN THE BIG PICTURE</b>, it's become hard to refute the evidence that upstream investment matters to health—and matters a lot. In one analysis, Bradley and her colleagues crunched 74 different studies that had examined the issue, and found a fairly consistent set of health benefits from social spending. In a separate<b> </b>study of U.S states, Bradley calculated that if such a shift in spending in a state were enough to increase the ratio of social spending to health care spending by 20 percent, it would on average equate to reducing the ranks of the obese in that state by 85,000, along with other health improvements. As strange as it sounds, that means the best way to improve health might often be to shift money <i>away</i> from health care.</p><br><p>That’s not an easy political case to make, in part because putting hard dollar values on decisions like that is so tricky. In fact, for a long time researchers didn't even try. A study published in the British Medical Journal, for instance, found that nearly half the studies that looked at both the costs and health care-savings benefits of social programs simply presented the data without bothering to do a full cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>Even when the benefits are clearly visible, policymakers immediately run into the so-called &quot;long pocket&quot; problem: The costs of social spending start piling up immediately, while most of the health benefits pay off years and even decades in the future. That's politically unappealing to elected officials on two- and four-year cycles, to say nothing of appointees who need to show results while they're still in office. And politics aside, investing for distant returns is both psychologically and economically hard to justify. &quot;To the extent that investment is diverted somewhere, you give up a stream of benefits that could have been had if you invested somewhere else,&quot; says David Weimer, a policy economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Even in the unlikely chance that researchers managed to run a study for 40 years to fully capture the long-term benefits of a program, Weimer points out, there's a pretty good chance that the original program would feel irrelevant in a much-changed world.</p><p>For those reasons, program sponsors and researchers are now focusing on the shorter term, trying to prove that social spending can pay off quickly in reduced health care costs. One sweet spot is in subsidized housing, where benefits often accrue right away, especially for the most challenging patients. </p><p>In Portland, Oregon, in 2011, the city's housing bureau, in collaboration with county agencies, began placing more than 7,000 residents without homes in a large, new facility. Because most of the residents were covered by Medicaid and received healthcare from local public facilities, it was possible to track the costs of their care from the start. Within a few years, those costs had on average fallen by 55 percent—adding up to an annual drop in health care costs of about $1,100 per person. A similar program in Chicago, led by the city's housing and health agency and University of Illinois Hospital, reduced health care costs by 42 percent. </p><p>A few private-sector organizations are jumping in, too, particularly on the food side. Humana Health, which provides both health insurance and health care, is running programs in Louisville, Kentucky and four other Southern cities, offering healthier food to vulnerable parts of the community, and has already documented an average $15-per-month-per-patient reduction in health care costs. UnitedHealthcare, another insurance and care provider, has announced a comparable program in Mississippi in collaboration with Alcorn State University. [UnitedHealthcare is financial underwriter for POLITICO’s Agenda 2020 series, but was not involved in conceiving or editing this story.]</p><p>The savings these programs report may seem relatively small, but they're at least proof of concept, and are expected to grow over time as the health benefits help slow or even head off expensive long-term conditions like diabetes and heart disease. What's more, <i>any </i>reduction in health costs stands in sharp and welcome contrast to what has long been a steep, steady upward march. &quot;We're getting pretty clean evidence now that communities that invest in these programs see lower medical spending,&quot; says Glen Mays, a public health researcher at the University of Kentucky.</p><p>One of the most closely watched programs has been that run by Minneapolis-based Hennepin Health, an accountable care organization for patients on Medicaid run by the surrounding county. Minnesota sharply expanded Medicaid eligibility in the state in 2011 and again in 2014, bringing in about 10,000 new enrollees under Hennepin's care, representing well over $300 million in new health care costs. These enrollees, all of whom were poor and many of whom didn't have permanent housing, were being admitted to the hospital at three times the rate of other nonelderly adults, and were visiting the emergency department an astonishing 13 times as often, according to Ross Owen, the health strategy director for Hennepin County. Each such admission or visit can easily rack up thousands of dollars in costs, making reducing them good targets for a program. &quot;Those are the low-hanging fruits of these kinds of interventions,&quot; says Owen.</p><p>Though Hennepin is a health care organization, it started paying for a range of housing and other social services for its patients—services far outside of medicine—in hopes that they’d pay off by reducing the need for medical care. So far, five years into the program, it has found that emergency department visits have dropped 35 percent, while outpatient doctor visits—a much more cost-effective way to provide care—have risen 21 percent. Overall, health care costs for enrollees have been dropping 11 percent per year. The fast results have kept the county eager to maintain the program and even to expand it, says Owen. &quot;Requiring decades to show savings from an investment doesn't match the way health care financing works,&quot; he explains.</p><p><b>ONE BIG OBSTACLE</b> to using these insights is that the broader American health system really isn’t set up to benefit from long-term preventive investments. Right now, the incentive to spend on upstream services is largely limited to agencies and organizations that, like Hennepin Health, are in &quot;closed systems&quot;—that is, where the payer also provides the care, so the organization spending money will be the same one reaping the benefits. Other such closed systems include Kaiser Permanente and Veterans Affairs, which notably have also have been providing housing benefits to their neediest enrollees. But most of American healthcare doesn't work this way: Payers and providers operate in separate and competing realms. Insurers have an incentive to keep costs down, but most don't hang onto individual customers long enough for distant payoffs to matter. Hospitals and doctors, meanwhile, make more money by providing more care, so they have no obvious financial incentive to invest in social services that will leave patients needing less of it.</p><p>Of course, government and other agencies can fund those services, but if those savings do materialize, they may never come back to the taxpayers who funded them. Even local governments can get cut out, because the federal government would be the biggest beneficiaries of any savings in Medicaid or Medicare treatment. It's called the &quot;wrong pocket&quot; problem: The money comes out of one party's pocket, but the benefits go into someone else's.</p><p>And justifying the investments with the biggest benefits may be an even steeper challenge. Many researchers have come to believe that the most important long-term health payoffs are likely to come from investments in education, environmental cleanup and urban design—areas even further removed from health care, and where the payoffs that are even more diffuse and distant. But now researchers may be closing in on ways to convincingly document those more elusive gains, as well.</p><p>The first problem they’re encountering is just how little information is available to work with. A study published in the BMJ surveyed the research on the question and found the <i>longest</i> follow-up period of health outcomes ended less than four years after the social-service intervention. For many kinds of investments, like better education, and for many types of health payoffs, like diabetes or Alzheimer's, that would barely even be the starting point for observing returns. &quot;Expectations that health impacts will be observed in this short timescale may be naive,&quot; the authors drily noted.</p><p>And &quot;health&quot; itself is a frustratingly hard thing to put a clear economic value on. In health care economics writ large, benefits and their values can be very subjective, and can veer into difficult moral issues. One crude but effective way to measure at least the relative value of upstream interventions is simply to determine which ones leave people less likely to die sooner. For example, one study calculated that every $1,000 invested in the education of a low-income child can add more than a month to the child's life--which adds up to a much higher return on investment than, say, colorectal cancer screening, and exceeds by a factor of three the widely accepted threshold for the level of risk reduction required to justify a public-health intervention. </p><p>Researchers at the University of Michigan found that the sorts of conditions addressed by social-service spending figure heavily in mortality and health. They concluded that about one out of five deaths can be attributed to conditions in the immediate environment; that low-income individuals are 29 percent more likely to die in any given time period than those of middle income; and that social circumstances account for 40 percent of what influences health. A United Kingdom study found that a jump in the mortality rate coincided with a drop in social-service spending there in 2010, leading to 120,000 more deaths from 2010 to 2017 than there would have been if the pre-2010 rate had held steady. It's no different in the U.S., says Alex Sutherland, research leader at Rand Europe. &quot;The impact of tiny investments can be dramatic,&quot; he says. &quot;A 1 percentage point increase in social spending would add up to 16 million additional years of life across the whole U.S. population.&quot;</p><p>While these sorts of findings bring home the impact of social services on health, they don't really give policymakers the hard-dollar numbers that would help politicians make a more clear-eyed case to the public. One way to do that, says Weimer, is to come up with so-called &quot;shadow prices&quot; for things like an extra year of life, or a percentage drop in the risk of a disease. &quot;Economists come up with rules of thumb that allowing valuing savings in commuter time as, for example, half the wage rate,&quot; he says. &quot;We need to develop the same sort of thing for health improvements.&quot; These shadow prices could then be discounted in a straightforward way if they kick in over time, and then added up like any other return on investment. </p><p><b>BUT THERE MAY</b> be an even better way to make the accounting case for the long-term health benefits of social spending—one that borrows a tactic from pharmaceutical studies. Those studies frequently use surrogate endpoints like lower cholesterol as a way to forecast longer-term heart benefits. Several researchers are now working on approaches that look for short-term health markers that strongly correlate with long-term outcomes. One of them is Andrew Fenelon, a public-health scientist at the University of Maryland's Population Research Center, who's planning to integrate federal data on 40,000 households with biomarkers like blood pressure to come up with projections of how spending on housing is likely to affect long-term health and to do it within a few years rather than a few decades. &quot;We usually rely on self-reported health,&quot; he says. &quot;But biomarkers give us a way of validating the data with objective clinical measures.&quot;</p><p>In a similar vein, researchers are looking at cholesterol levels in a Pittsburgh low-income neighborhood that recently got a supermarket after years as a food desert. So far, new cases of high cholesterol have dropped 10 percent in a year. And Mays is involved in a study with Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis that's integrating electronic medical records with community social-service resources. That's an approach that could pay off on both the cause and effect sides: first, by making it easier for health care providers to flag patients who would most benefit from a social intervention and funnel them directly into services; and then by ensuring that downstream health results are tabulated directly alongside records of past interventions for clear cost/benefit calculations.</p><br><p>Some researchers think that the best biomarkers for linking social service investment to long-term health will involve those that indicate inflammation, strongly correlated with stress, and now seen by many in medicine as important factors in everything from heart disease to cancer to Alzheimer's. Inflammation markers can shift quickly with changes in the environment, notes Apostolos Davillas, senior research officer at the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex in the U.K. &quot;When you see elevated inflammation biomarkers it's a clear indicator that something's happening in the body's stress pathway,&quot; he says. &quot;It can show us how socioeconomic status can literally get under someone's skin.&quot; Davillis is already working with blood samples that provide inflammation data that can be pulled together with other health care markers, like BMI, along with detailed social and economic data. &quot;It's the only good way to evaluate the effects of social policies on the health of the population,&quot; he says. Future efforts could add in measurements of diet, exercise levels, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and other lifestyle indicators that are all correlated with long-term health outcomes.</p><p>One of the most ambitious new efforts is being funded by the Gates Foundation. The project brings together researchers from Harvard and Stanford to sift through and analyze a wealth of data from 1999 to 2014 covering neighborhood conditions, socioeconomic status, biomarkers and health outcomes all across the U.S. population. The goal is to nail down how long-term health outcomes vary with income and neighborhood factors, and to use those findings to identify the social policies that are likely to provide the biggest returns in long-term health. The scope of the project, as well as of the caliber and weight of its sponsor and participants, are good indicators of both the scale of the challenge and the enthusiasm about its potential. </p><p><b>IT'S ONE THING</b> if this and many other projects together succeed in building a clear-cut, hard-dollars case for the big health payback of social-service spending. Having those results matter is another thing. There's no guarantee that, even in the face of strong proof to the contrary, politicians won't keep on with business as usual, continuing to throw the bigger bucks at health care—which has big, well-funded lobbies and enjoys broad public support—rather than the social conditions that make the care necessary. After all, they've done a pretty good job of shrugging off the evidence so far. &quot;It's been making less and less sense to look at medical diagnoses when you want make health-related spending decisions, and more and more sense to look at demographics,&quot; says Hennepin's Owen. &quot;The way we distribute resources in this country ignores that reality.&quot;</p><p>But the more scientifically and economically hard-nosed these measurements get, the broader a constituency they could attract. Bradley, who advocated for more social-service spending in her 2013 book &quot;The American Health Care Paradox,&quot; suggests that a more powerful, long-term economic case for health-related savings wouldn't just change the policy conversation—it could change the politics around the issue.</p><p>When conservative cost-cutters take aim at America's unsustainable medical spending, they tend to sharpen their knives for safety-net programs like Medicare and Medicaid. What if the smartest economic move to rein in those costs were actually to <i>spend</i> money, but direct it judiciously elsewhere? That could make this kind of public-health reform more than a progressive fantasy. &quot;Bobby Jindal and other Republican governors said they liked the idea as a way to spend less on Medicaid and to make the best investments possible,&quot; Bradley says. Some in Congress want to get private investment involved in providing support for social-service programs that pay off in clear, measurable savings in healthcare, among other benefits. That approach, called &quot;social impact bonds,&quot; has been winning some bipartisan support, including from no less a Republican stalwart than Orrin Hatch.</p><p>The quest to demonstrate powerful, broad, long-term health benefits to a range of social-service investment offers the chance to reshape the politics around American social spending. That means looking at improvements that tend to play out over one or more decades. Such long-pocket payoffs may not normally play well in politics, but if the case were strong enough and the returns big enough, legislators might not be able to say no.</p><p><i>David H.

        "content": "<p>HOUSTON — In early January, freezing temperatures hit Texas’ most populous city, killing at least two homeless people. It was the type of weather that, just a couple of years ago, would have sent Allan Clifton to the emergency room. Instead the 64-year old spent much of the day in shorts in a studio apartment, paid for with federal dollars.<b> </b></p><p>Clifton spent much of 2015 and early 2016 homeless on Houston’s streets until he got his apartment as part of a city project to provide housing for chronically homeless people who frequently end up in the emergency room. When he was homeless, Clifton ended up in the emergency room about<b> </b>once a month, whenever his back, injured in a 2013 motorcycle accident, would give out. Since he got the apartment 18 months ago, he’s appeared in the emergency room only once, after a bicycle accident, and his back has improved so much that he rarely needs pain pills. </p><p>“Being on the street with pain pills is not a good thing, because they’ll jack you for them,” said Clifton, who also has a congenital hand deformity and was treated for Hepatitis C. Now, “I can shut my door and I ain’t worried about nothing.”</p><p>Having the city pay someone's rent might seem like a costly way to address homelessness. But add health care to the mix and the equation starts to look different: Health care and housing experts have long known that keeping someone off the streets is often the most straightforward way to keep him or her out of the emergency room, one of the most expensive places to get health care.</p><p>For just as long, however, they’ve struggled to figure out just what to do with that knowledge. The problem, in a nutshell, is who will pay? How do you persuade governments to spend money on housing when the biggest payoff comes from money saved somewhere else in the system?</p><p>One reason health care in America is so expensive is that patients with some of the costliest cases require not only health care, but a roof over their heads and counseling to gain ordinary skills for living, like how to manage a bank account. But the agencies that manage health don't think much about housing, and vice versa — it's simply not their job. “The reason this is collectively hard is that you just have to pull resources from lots of different groups and think creatively about how you use these resources,” said Neal Rackleff, assistant secretary for community planning and development at HUD and formerly director of Houston’s housing and community development department. “Different groups have different ways of doing things.”</p><br><p>The program that got Clifton into an apartment is an effort to bridge those gaps, a four-year effort by the city of Houston to solve that bureaucratic tangle. But for the program to grow beyond a localized short-term project into a permanent statewide program, its proponents will have to convince Texas’ conservative lawmakers that the framework will save the state money in the long run. They have until 2019, when the state Legislature next convenes, to convince lawmakers to let the state’s Medicaid program, which covers health care costs for the homeless, to spend some of of those funds on housing support instead. </p><p>If they can figure it out, their strategy might help other states as well. Some Democratic-leaning states, including Washington and California are already experimenting with paying for such housing services. But in conservative Texas, lawmakers spent much of their last legislative sessions debating how to further cut the joint state and federal health program, not expand it to tackle housing. Frances Isbell, who helps run the project for the city, is convinced that once her group finishes its cost analysis this year, it will be able to show that investing money upfront in housing support services can save the entire state significant amounts of money, not just in emergency room costs, but in costs associated with prisons, police, fire, and other departments. And — who knows — it might catch on elsewhere. “There is a real conservative argument to be made for continuing this program,” said Isbell, CEO of a federally qualified health center called Healthcare for the Homeless-Houston. “We can prove that it works.”</p><p><b>IT'S NO GREAT </b>secret that helping out high-cost patients with their housing can have big payoffs for public health. More than a decade ago, a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/02/13/million-dollar-murray\" target=\"_blank\">profile</a> of “<a href=\"http://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/A%20MillionDollarMurray.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Million Dollar Murray”</a> in the New Yorker magazine created an iconic example of how cities could spend more money to keep a homeless man with health problems on the street than it would cost to pay for his housing — and treat his ills in the process. </p><p>Where the idea breaks down, as many big-picture policy insights do, is in the details of how to make it happen. Agencies that pay for housing and health are governed by their own particular sets of financing, regulations and organizational practices, differences that are difficult to bridge. For example, working with federal funds creates a puzzle for city officials like those in Houston. Medicaid money can’t be used for room and board unless those are provided by a nursing home, while federal housing vouchers can be used only for housing, not health care. To complicate the matter, the funds wind up in different places. Medicaid dollars go to the state and funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development are directed among dozens of local housing agencies. Plus, working with Health and Human Services and HUD means contending with complex sets of regulations that often are at odds with each other: HHS and HUD literally have two different definitions of chronic homelessness, with the HHS definition being more broad and the HUD definition being more strict. </p><p>Some difficulties are local. Even well-intentioned hospitals aren’t equipped to handle patients with serious illnesses who face long-term homelessness. Busy medical staff don’t always know whether patients are going home to an apartment or to an underpass. They often can do little more than discharge homeless people onto the streets with a handful of prescriptions, which are useless if they can’t be filled or if the patients’ medications are stolen. Meanwhile, housing providers, who don’t have access to medical records, are quick to kick out tenants who violate their lease, which allows little time for people who have been homeless for long periods to adjust to housing and figure out how to stay on their medications. </p><br><p>Houston’s project grew out of efforts by former Mayor Annise Parker’s efforts to reduce homelessness and it got a boost from President Barack Obama’s administration, which permitted states to apply for a waiver from Medicaid rules and to redirect federal funds in ways not previously allowed. Texas received a waiver that allowed Houston’s health department to experiment with using Medicaid funds for housing services. The city’s housing authorities pitched in by contributing HUD vouchers. </p><p>The resulting project was called Integrated Care for the Chronically Homeless, which combined the forces of Isbell’s health center, a social services provider called SEARCH Homeless Services, and New Hope Housing. Under the project terms, people who are chronically homeless and have at least three emergency department visits over two years are placed in permanent supportive housing units, where they receive a variety of services to help keep them there. </p><p>But it wasn’t always an easy fit. Mandy Chapman Semple, tasked in 2013 by the mayor to head up the city’s initiatives to address homelessness, had to convince the health care folks that if they wanted the project to succeed, they would have to get their hands dirty in homeless services. “The health care system generally had not seen themselves as a homeless service provider,” Semple recalled. </p><p>Isbell, from Healthcare for Homeless-Houston, admits that she and her organization didn’t quickly adjust to the idea that they would share responsibility for more than delivering medical or dental care. “They wanted us to get really involved in housing retention in terms of being able to pass inspections,” Isbell said. “We agreed, at the very beginning, including the staff, ‘Wait a second, that’s not our [responsibility]—that’s the housing folks. They’re the ones that should be dealing with that.’”</p><p>Isbell’s reluctance was overcome once she realized that while organizations were trying to figure out who should do what, tenants were getting kicked out of their apartments. She took on the task of helping provide housing support services, even when that meant her<b> </b>health team had to throw on protective suits to clean a tenant’s apartment while working with the doctor to adjust their medications.</p><p>Then they had to figure out how to structure the program to keep clients, who faced great challenges, in their housing over the long term. Each client is assigned a three-person care team from the health center and SEARCH, the social services provider, that includes a nurse, a community health worker and a case manager. The team meets regularly to help the patient adjust to housing, schedule their medical appointments, hold their hand before major surgery and help fill prescriptions. The care team also meets regularly with the housing provider to address any issues that crop up before a tenant gets evicted. New Hope Housing, the housing provider, meanwhile, has loosened some of its rules, such as a zero-tolerance fighting policy, to help keep clients in their homes. </p><p>“There is just a lot of trauma that goes along with being homeless,” said Andrea Piro, a registered nurse with Healthcare for the Homeless-Houston. “Getting housed doesn’t solve that.”</p><p>Despite the initial bumps, the program seems to be working to reduce the amount of time clients spend in the emergency room. Clients who have been enrolled for two years have seen an 82 percent decline in emergency room usage. Isbell said one client went to the emergency department 122 times in the year before he was admitted. Once he had housing, he still was a frequent emergency department visitor —averaging 12 visits a year over three years — but Houston’s health care system was still saving money. The program now serves nearly 200 people spread across four Houston housing complexes that cater to people with low incomes.<br>There are limits to what it can accomplish and not everyone in the program gets better. But for some, it’s been life changing. Piro said one of her clients landed a job with IBM and now has a higher income than she does. </p><p>The project’s financial lifeline, however, is about to run out. The pool of waiver money that the program relies on ends in four years. To keep the project going in Houston and to scale it up across the state, Isbell and others working on it will have to prove it’s worth the state’s investment. </p><br><p><b>ISBELL AND THE </b>project’s leaders plan to spend the next year quantifying cost savings and capturing its monetary benefit to the state. It won’t be easy, in part because county hospitals don’t always track whether patients are homeless. </p><p>The effort has momentum on its side, however, as runaway medical costs are forcing the federal government and states to think more creatively to curb spending. The Houston program’s annual cost runs about $8,500 per patient, whereas a single visit to the emergency department can cost from $740 to $3,437, according to <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055491#s3\" target=\"_blank\">a 2013 study.</a> </p><p>Realizing that housing support services could be one answer to the problem of escalating health costs, in 2015 the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/cib-06-26-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">cracked open a door</a> that could allow states to start more formally including housing support services in Medicaid programs.</p><p>Few states have taken the current administration up on the offer. If Texas lawmakers do agree to include housing support services in its Medicaid program when they meet next year, it would make the state one of the most progressive in terms of combining housing and health care. Programs like the one in Houston could flourish in other Texas cities with high homeless populations. If lawmakers don’t agree, the Houston program will wither on the vine once its temporary source of federal funding dries up.</p><p>Some insurers are not waiting for regulators and lawmakers to catch up. UnitedHealthcare, which operates Texas’ Medicaid plans, have hired housing experts in 11 states including Texas on its own dime to help with the Houston pilot and assist clients in other parts of the state with more limited housing support. The insurer is heavily involved in studies to prove that paying for housing support services through Medicaid ends up saving money and lives down the road. [UnitedHealthcare is financial underwriter for POLITICO’s Agenda 2020 series, but was not involved in conceiving or editing this story.]</p><p>Meanwhile, clients who have so far been helped by the program are hoping that lawmakers can find a way to keep it around. During the eight years that Andrew Brown lived on Houston’s streets, asthma attacks sent him to the emergency room about four times a year. Since he moved into his studio about four years ago, he hasn’t once visited an emergency room even though he’s since been diagnosed with diabetes and takes medication for impulse control. </p><p>“If I had not got housed, I probably would have ended up way sicker,” Brown said.</p><p>Because he no longer has to worry about his pills or inhaler getting stolen or figuring out where to take a bath, the 60-year-old has more time to focus on his health and his future. The former diesel technician said he hopes to start working at Wal-Mart part time and wants to eventually go back to school to learn medical coding. But even if his circumstances improve, he plans to keep his apartment or upgrade to a one bedroom in the same complex.</p><p>“It took me a while to get used to staying here,” Brown said. “Now I am home. Can’t beat it.”</p><p><i>Renuka Rayasam is a health reporter for POLITICO Pro based in Texas. </i></p><br>",

Citing the #MeToo movement and Hollywood women’s “Time’s Up” initiative, Carlson is calling it “a cultural revolution.” </p><p>On a personal level, Carlson is experiencing revolutions of her own: Since she settled the harassment suit with Fox News’ parent company for $20 million, Carlson has come out with a new book (“Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Back Your Power”), lobbied on Capitol Hill to end forced arbitration clauses, started a charitable foundation and, most recently, taken over as the head of the Miss America pageant. </p><p>And in her wide-ranging interview with “Women Rule,” Carlson revealed she’s also plotting a comeback on the airwaves. </p><p>“I do plan on getting back into television,” she said. “I’ve just started to dip my feet back in the waters of figuring out what might be out there, and what might that look like for Gretchen, because it may or may not be a daily show. It may be something totally different.”</p><p>She’s excited about one project in particular: a new docuseries “with an iconic Hollywood producer.” Promising that it’ll be “amazing” and “incredibly timely,” Carlson stayed tight-lipped about the series’ exact focus but noted that it would be out in May of this year. </p><p>For the moment, Carlson is focused on the place that first launched her television career: the Miss America pageant. </p><p>The former pageant queen recently took the reigns as chair of the organization, following the resignation of its CEO and previous chairman amid leaks of sexist email exchanges.</p><br><p>For her tenure, Carlson — who was crowned Miss America in 1989 while representing Minnesota — is pledging a cultural shift at the pageant contest. And in the interview, she laid out a plan that includes filling out her board of directors, hiring a new CEO and tackling how to “message” the organization. She acknowledged that it’s going to be “a challenge” to turn the messaging around the pageant into one that’s about empowering women. </p><p>With Carlson’s recent focus on women’s empowerment and activism, it has led some to question whether the former news anchor plans to run for political office. </p><p>“I was asked to run for Senate in Connecticut,” she said. “Some people were putting my name out there for Minnesota in my home state.” </p><p>But a career on Capitol Hill isn’t likely to be in the cards just yet. Of speculation that she could run for Senate this year in her native Minnesota, Carlson said, “I’m not moving back there right now, and I’m not running for Senate in Connecticut right now.” </p><p>Still, Carlson left the door open to a future in politics. </p><p>“Look at my life. It’s been mysterious, right?” she said. “And I’ve gone through so many different paths. So I’m not going to say never, because I don’t know, to be honest with you.” </p><p>For now, she’s encouraging other women to loudly advocate for themselves — in Congress, in their workplace, in races for local office. </p><p>“We need to tell our members of Congress what we care about,” she said. “Speaking up and being fierce is more than just speaking up about sexual harassment. It’s about having a voice about any injustice you face in your life.” </p><p>Read below for more highlights from the “Women Rule” interview with Carlson. </p><p><br><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=3m45s\" target=\"_blank\">3:45</a> Carlson discusses the “cultural revolution” happening around sexual harassment and assault in the work place. After feeling like the lone voice speaking out against it back in July 2016, Carlson says, she would consider herself a catalyst for the current moment. </p><p>“The gift of courage is contagious,” she says. </p><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=6m20s\" target=\"_blank\">6:20</a> Carlson weighs in on her childhood in Minnesota and her past lives as a classical violinist and pageant queen. </p><p>“I never expected to be the face of sexual harassment, for God’s sake,” she says. “I never expected to be the chairwoman of the Miss America organization. But the one consistent thing in my life has been that when there’s a challenge in front of me, I go for it.” </p><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=12m01s\" target=\"_blank\">12:00</a> Carlson talks about President Donald Trump and her 30-year relationship with the celebrity billionaire. </p><p>“I was not surprised that he became president of the United States,” she says. “Because he used to come on my morning show, right when ‘The Apprentice’ started.”</p><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=15m20s\" target=\"_blank\">15:20</a> The new chair of the Miss America pageant lays out a plan for changes in the organization and what she hopes to accomplish. </p><p>“It’s a huge volunteer job,” Carlson says. “How do we bring Miss America up to speed in this same way in which I jumped off that cliff, for all women? How do we make this as empowering as we possibly can? So, there may be changes coming.”</p><br><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=19m35s\" target=\"_blank\">19:35</a> Carlson goes over her book “Be Fierce” and gives advice to women encountering sexual harassment at work. </p><p>“There’s a whole chapter on parenting,” she mentions. “There’s a whole chapter on men, because so many men reached out to me after this, saying, ‘We want to help.’”</p><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=25m43s\" target=\"_blank\">25:43</a> Carlson tells the story of how she has talked to her own children about her experiences with harassment. </p><p>“The night before I filed the suit, I sat my children down and told them for the first time,” she says. “And you know, it was a very emotional experience, because I had no earthly idea what the hell was going to happen next.” </p><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=28m1s\" target=\"_blank\">28:01</a> The former news anchor discusses her latest charitable efforts, like the Gift of Courage fund she began and the Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative for Underserved Women, which holds workshops for women around the country on how to handle sexual harassment and domestic violence. </p><p><a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/5becf094?t=30m26s\" target=\"_blank\">30:26</a> Carlson discusses her future, including the possibility of running for political office, and another career in television. <br></p><br>",

        "content": "<br><p>Among the most memorable quotes from a new tell-all book about the Trump White House is Steve Bannon’s prediction that President Donald Trump’s oldest son would be hauled before Congress and grilled on live television about his contacts with Russians. </p><p>“They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,” Trump’s former political guru told Michael Wolff in his explosive new book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.”</p><p>But frustrated Democrats now say they’ve all but given up on their past vows to question the younger Trump before a national audience. The same goes for several other key Trump insiders whom, Democrats complain, Republicans have hidden from the klieg lights in order to protect the president.</p><p>Despite lawmakers’ pledges last year that other top Trump associates would also be questioned in open hearings before the cameras, none have done so — and, given talk among congressional Republicans of wrapping up their investigations, it looks increasingly likely they will not. </p><br><p>Democrats say that deprives the public of a clearer understanding of the unfolding Russia saga. It also means Trump allies who have been allowed to speak privately behind closed doors — often with staffers instead of the lawmakers themselves — have avoided the sort of spectacle that can make political history. Some of the most indelible moments from past scandals, like Watergate and Iran-Contra, occurred during televised appearances from insiders, such as Reagan White House aide Oliver North and Nixon administration lawyer John Dean, who infamously warned of “a cancer growing on the presidency.”</p><p>Last year’s dramatic testimony from former FBI Director James Comey, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former national intelligence director James Clapper dominated television and the Internet for days. Comey’s, in particular, infuriated Trump, whose advisers urged him not to tweet during the hearing. (He did not.) </p><p>Several Congressional Democrats tell POLITICO they have fought unsuccessfully to compel similar public testimony from numerous Trump associates and other participants who they believe could shed light on possible nefarious collaborations between the Kremlin and the campaign and transition team. That list includes Trump Jr. Trump’s son in law Jared Kushner and Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen.</p><p>As recently as September, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/politics/dianne-feinstein-donald-trump-jr-hearing/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> CNN she wanted Trump Jr. — who has met with both House and Senate committees behind closed doors — to testify in public “come hell or high water.”</p><p>But Republicans never approved that request — or several others, Democrats say.</p><p>In a statement to POLITICO, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, called for more open hearings with key Trump insiders, including Trump Jr., Kushner and Cohen.</p><p>“I believe that the American people would benefit from having those hearings in open session, so that they can make their own judgments about what happened in 2016,” Warner said. He also said committee members themselves would benefit from “having an opportunity to question directly some of the principal witnesses … as opposed to staff interviews.”</p><p>In a mid-September show of bipartisanship, Warner and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/19/politics/michael-cohen-senate-testimony-russia/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">vowed</a> to call Cohen before their panel for public testimony. But when Cohen appeared before the panel and the House Intelligence Committee the following month, he did so behind closed doors.</p><p>Republicans would not address whether they still plan to hold open hearings with key Trump officials. Several said they are confident their investigations have been thorough and in the public interest, and that they are ongoing. </p><p>“The committee will continue to follow the facts where they lead,” Burr told POLITICO in a statement. Burr added that he held 10 hearings last year on the subject of “Russian interference.”</p><p>A spokesman for the Republican House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), said he would not comment given the committee’s ongoing probe.</p><p>While unmatched in drama, televised hearings can encourage grandstanding among members of Congress. And in the case of the Russia investigation, they preclude the discussion of classified information. They can also allow witnesses to see each other’s testimony, potentially allowing them to alter their own stories. </p><p>But along with declining to hold public hearings, GOP committee leaders also have rejected closed-door interview sessions with several dozen witnesses proposed by Democrats, according to three Democratic lawmakers.</p><p>Those Democrats, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California, also said Republicans have blocked their requests for financial documents from key players like Trump Jr., Kushner, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump himself.</p><p>The Democrats are also seeking documents from financial institutions connected to figures in the Russia saga, including Deutsche Bank, which has been implicated in Russian money laundering and has loaned nine-figure sums to Trump and to Kushner's family business.</p><p>Democrats call such records critical to filling gaps in their understanding of Moscow’s 2016 election meddling and whether it might have involved some form of quid pro quo from the Trump campaign.</p><p>“At the end of the day, we will have done the country a disservice if we conclude the investigation without doing a thorough job, and if we are willing to make an incomplete report to the American people, or worse, one that's inaccurate, and later have to explain when information comes to the surface why we didn't care enough to pursue it,” said Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee. “But that’s where we are.”</p><p>As three congressional committees continue to probe issues related to Russia and the 2016 election, the parade of witnesses to Capitol Hill is not over yet. And it is still possible that some Trump associates would testify before the television cameras, although Democrats call that doubtful. </p><p>House Democrats said the GOP has turned to calling witnesses who will undermine the credibility of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department.</p><p>Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said both sides have been inviting witnesses but that not all have been fully cooperative. The committee is still trying to interview Kushner, he said — the one remaining witness from the Trump Tower meeting in which Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort met with a Russian lawyer who promised “dirt” on Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Democrats say their Republican counterparts are too reliant on requests for voluntary cooperation that are easily ignored. Some witnesses, including Trump Jr. and Attorney General Jeff Sessions — a former Trump campaign official — have simply refused to answer key questions or even cut short interviews by saying they were done cooperating. </p><br><p>Others have refused to provide documents and other information, or to respond to follow-up requests for information, Schiff, Wyden and other Democrats told POLITICO.</p><p>“We need the committee to use the compulsory process, but the majority thus far has been unwilling to do so in most cases,” said Swalwell, who, like Schiff, is a former prosecutor. “And that leaves some very important questions unanswered.”</p><p>Republicans in Congress have accused their Democratic colleagues of exploiting the Russia investigation for political gain and to inflict unfair damage on Trump and his associates.</p><p>Democrats can tick off numerous other examples of avenues of inquiry that they contend have been shut down, including many that lie outside the relatively narrow purview of Mueller, who has been tasked with identifying whether any laws were broken and whether the evidence merits criminal prosecution. </p><p>In contrast, the congressional committees — especially the intelligence panels — have the broader charge of providing a public accounting of what happened between Trump associates and Russian operatives during and after the election. They include interactions that fall short of collusion or illegal activity. As a result, their final public reports will be incomplete, Democrats say.</p><p>Wyden, who sits on two committees investigating Trump-Russia issues, said Senate Republicans initially were receptive to calling in Trump associates and obtaining documents from them. Beginning in June, though, he said he noticed a sharp pullback, at the same time that Trump himself began pressuring the GOP to protect him from investigations that were closing in on those around him.</p><p>In recent weeks, Wyden has become even more suspicious of Republican efforts to shut down the Senate investigation.</p><p>Wyden noted that Wolff’s book quotes Bannon discussing the sort of financial ties between Trump and Russian nationals that Wyden has long sought to investigate in greater detail.</p><br><p>“You realize where this is going. This is all about money laundering,” Bannon is quoted as saying. A statement of contrition Bannon issued earlier this week did not deny or retract that quote. </p><p>But Wyden said Republicans on both the intelligence committee and the Senate Finance Committee, where he is the ranking Democrat, have thwarted him.</p><p>“The fact that we have not had any kind of public visibility on ‘follow-the-money issues’ is a very significant deficiency of the inquiry,” Wyden said. “I think Jared Kushner ought to be back answering questions in public. I think Donald Trump Jr. should be back answering questions in public, and we would obviously coordinate with Mueller on that.”</p><p>“These issues are too important to just say this is all about letting a special counsel who has a charge with respect to criminal activity tell the entire story,” Wyden said. “Because there is a much broader story that the American people are owed, and it is the committee’s responsibility to tell that story.”<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<br><p>The IRS is facing its first big challenge implementing the new tax law: deciding how much in taxes to withhold from millions of Americans’ paychecks. </p><p>The agency is under pressure to take as little as possible so people will see big increases in their take-home pay ahead of this year’s midterm elections. </p><p>But that would come at a cost: smaller or even nonexistent refunds next year, though millions rely on them to plug holes in their family budgets. Democrats are already accusing the Trump administration of plotting &quot;phantom windfalls&quot; ahead of the November contest that will come back to haunt taxpayers next tax season. </p><p>“We oppose any attempts by the administration to systematically under-withhold income taxes during the 2018 tax year, knowing that in 2019 taxpayers may find they owe taxes when they were expecting a refund,” Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Richard Neal, the top Democrats on congressional tax committees, wrote to acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter. </p><p>How the IRS — which is supposed to be apolitical — decides to implement withholding could go a long way toward shaping public opinion on the controversial law. </p><p>Workers could see changes in their paychecks as soon as next month, the agency said, and for many it will be the first time they see what exactly the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 means to them. </p><p>Even before President Donald Trump signed the bill into law last month, Republicans were promising Americans they wouldn’t have to wait long to see the benefits. </p><p>“You’re going to start seeing a lot more money in your paycheck,” Trump said on Monday during a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation. </p><p>Asked about Democrats’ warnings of politically motivated withholding changes, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said, “There’s never been any question about the IRS’ timely, accurate withholding tables, nor should there be today.” </p><br><p>Democrats will “do and say just about anything to cast doubt” on the Republican tax program, Brady said. </p><p>The IRS did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>There is a history of politicians trying to manipulate withholding, through obscure tables issued by the IRS, with an eye toward providing a short-term boost to the economy. President George H.W. Bush tried it ahead of the 1992 election, and the 1986 tax overhaul attempted, unsuccessfully, to quash refunds altogether. </p><p>Most of the new tax law took effect Jan. 1 because Republicans want it to boost growth before voters head to the polls this fall. </p><p>As Wyden and Neal pointed out, bigger paychecks now could mean a nasty surprise in 2019. Some accustomed to receiving annual refunds could find themselves suddenly in arrears to the IRS. </p><p>“This is not something you want to fool the American taxpayer about — you don’t want to have them feeling good because they’re getting a big bump in take-home pay only to be surprised next year,” said Larry Gibbs, a former IRS commissioner. </p><p>“People ought to be able to understand what is being withheld from their paycheck and what that means — not just in terms of a bump in take-home pay, but also whether they’re still going to get a refund,” he said. </p><p>How much is withheld is a product of two things: The allowances claimed on the W-4 form filed with employers, and the tables the IRS produces telling payroll administrators how much to withhold at given income levels, taking into account the allowances employees claimed. </p><p>The IRS is now working on withholding tables to reflect the new tax law. In a statement late last month, the agency suggested it would not be issuing new W-4s.</p><p>“This information will be designed to work with existing Forms W-4 that employees have already filed, and no further action by taxpayers is needed at this time,” the IRS said. </p><p>About 80 percent of taxpayers will get a tax cut averaging $2,100 thanks to the new law, according to the independent Tax Policy Center. About 5 percent will face tax increases averaging $2,800 while the remainder will see essentially no change in their tax bills. </p><p>Taxpayers have long prized their tax refunds. The share receiving money back from the IRS at tax time has been firmly lodged at 70 percent or more since the 1960s, despite complaints from experts that it amounts to giving the government an interest-free loan.</p><p>In 2016, Kautter, then working at a consulting firm, bemoaned the number of people receiving refunds each year, while acknowledging taxpayers like being essentially forced to save. </p><p>“It drives me nuts,” Kautter told POLITICO that April. “You don’t lend money to other people interest free.” </p><br><p>For millions, it is the single largest payment they receive all year. </p><p>The IRS generally likes people getting refunds as well, because it means fewer people who owe taxes it must chase down. </p><p>So the withholding sweet spot might be for people to get bigger paychecks this year, but not so large that it erases their refunds next year.</p><p>That will be technically difficult, experts say, because the Republican plan dumped the concept of personal exemptions, which are key to figuring out how much to withhold from someone’s paycheck, and it’s not clear how the agency will make up for that. </p><p>What’s more, about 8.5 million taxpayers will see tax increases, according to TPC, which not only threaten their refunds. It could also put them at risk of incurring underpayment penalties the IRS imposes on those who pay less than 90 percent of their taxes during the calendar year.</p><p>The IRS has provided little guidance thus far on how exactly it intends to proceed, leaving payroll administrators scratching their heads. </p><p>“There’s definitely some unanswered questions,” said Mike Trabold, director of compliance risk at Paychex, a payroll administration firm. </p><p>He wonders if the IRS will make any withholding changes retroactive to the beginning of this year. Others wonder if and when the agency will have to develop new W-4 forms, and whether it will waive those underpayment penalties. </p><p>Lawmakers have tried to increase people’s paychecks before, by unilaterally changing withholding, and faced a backlash from the public. </p><br><p>The 1986 overhaul ordered the Treasury Department to devise a more accurate withholding system that would slash the number of people getting refunds each year. “You can kiss your tax refund goodbye, and with it the summer vacations, new refrigerators and fall wardrobes it has paid for,” The Washington Post reported in April 1987. </p><p>But the revised W-4 form the agency produced was so complicated that it became hugely unpopular and was dropped. </p><p>A few years later, Bush, then running for reelection, ordered the government to withhold less from paychecks in hopes of boosting the economy. </p><p>But many people didn’t want the extra money if it meant losing their refunds, and within a few years, refunds had returned to previous levels.</p><p><i>Bernie Becker contributed to this report.</i><br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Donald Trump delivered a big political contribution to Rick Scott on Tuesday as the Florida governor contemplates a bid for U.S. Senate: a pledge to spare Florida from administration plans to expand offshore oil drilling nationwide.</p><p>The surprise announcement from Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke — who went to the trouble of flying to Tallahassee to stand beside Scott — outraged environmentalists and Democrats who insist<b> </b>the decision was a political ploy that unlawfully gave preferential treatment to Florida, a swing state that voted for Trump and that’s home to his so-called “Winter White House” escape at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.</p><p>Zinke made sure that the term-limited governor got all the credit. In response to a question about what was the final determining factor in his decision, Zinke said: “The governor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have a tremendous governor that is straightforward, easy to work for, says exactly what he means. And I can tell you Florida is well-served,” Zinke said.</p><p>Zinke’s glowing endorsement of Scott has become de facto policy for Trump, who has tried for more than a year to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/12/31/scott-to-meet-dine-with-trump-at-mar-a-lago-165109\" target=\"_blank\"><u>woo Scott</u></a> publicly and privately to run for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson. The veteran senator is one of the most vocal opponents of offshore oil-drilling in Florida, an issue that typically enjoys broad bipartisan support in a state whose economy depends heavily on tourism and development along 1,300 miles of coastline.</p><p>Scott used to be an exception to the blanket opposition to offshore oil drilling. In 2010, the then-political newcomer voiced more support for oil exploration, but the position became a political liability in the state after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill coated some Florida beaches with tar balls and damaged tourism in parts of the Gulf.</p><p>A 2016 University of South Florida-Nielson poll found that 47 percent of state residents see offshore drilling as a move in the “wrong direction,” a distinction that makes it one of the most unpopular policy proposals in the state.</p> <br><p>So when Zinke <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/04/trump-drilling-coasts-pacific-atlantic-florida-324025\" target=\"_blank\"><u>announced </u></a>last Thursday that the administration wanted to open vast new stretches of federal waters to oil and gas drilling, opposition was united in Florida — from liberal environmentalists to conservative lawmakers and even Scott, who issued a rare <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/01/04/scott-wants-florida-removed-from-federal-offshore-oil-drilling-plan-170772\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public denunciation</u></a> of the policy.</p><p>At the time, Democrats and Nelson supporters highlighted the unpopular policy announcement by a president who’s flagging in the polls. Nelson’s campaign began fundraising off of the initial announcement to expand oil exploration.</p><p>One Republican insider, however, told POLITICO shortly after the initial announcement that the administration would scale the plan back somewhat to give Scott a political boost that would “be a big win, and it won’t be Bill Nelson bringing it home.”</p><p>As late as Tuesday, Nelson was still fundraising off the drilling announcement. “President Trump is about to hand a huge victory to the oil industry and put Florida’s entire economy at risk,” Nelson’s campaign wrote. “He just announced plans to rollback offshore drilling regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, and open up nearly all federal waters to offshore oil drilling — including the eastern Gulf of Mexico.”</p><p>But just before that email solicitation was sent out, Zinke was unexpectedly standing in Tallahassee’s regional airport with Scott announcing the reversal to the Florida capital press corps.</p><p>Nelson said he was incredulous.</p><p>“I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. But now, suddenly, Secretary Zinke announces plans to drill off Florida's coast and four days later agrees to ‘take Florida off the table’? I don’t believe it,” Nelson said in a written statement. “This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott, who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career. We shouldn’t be playing politics with the future of Florida.”</p><p>Similarly, the Sierra Club of Florida said the decision was “a purely political move to aid the ambitions of Rick Scott.” And the League of Conservation Voters called it a “publicity stunt.”</p><p>Scott’s spokesman, Jonathan Tupps, said oil-drilling opponents should not be upset.</p><p>“Senator Nelson and anyone else who opposes oil drilling off of Florida’s coast should be happy that the governor was able to secure this commitment,” he said. “This isn’t about politics. This is good policy for Florida.”</p><p>Tupps said that, contrary to claims by Scott’s opponents, the governor and staff have frequently discussed Florida’s opposition to more offshore oil drilling with the Interior Department. Scott personally raised the issue with Zinke in an October meeting in Washington, Tupps said.</p><p>Why Zinke suddenly reversed months of planning four days after announcing the new oil and gas exploration policy are unclear. Zinke also made his announcement via Twitter after a brief question-and-answer session with reporters in Tallahassee.</p><p>In reversing the policy for Florida, however, Zinke may have have run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act, critics said. That could give ammunition to California and Atlantic Coast states wanting to get on the same no-drill list -- the opposite of what President Donald Trump intended when he directed Zinke to expand oil companies’ access to federal waters to boost U.S. energy production.</p><br><p>The American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard earlier in the day had applauded the Trump administration’s plan to make all available federal waters available for drilling, saying “It represents a bold acknowledgement of the industry’s advancements in technology to safely access U.S. energy resources.”</p><p>Almost immediately after Zinke’s announcement, lawmakers from other states took to Twitter to raise the specter of lawsuits, which could lead to courtroom entanglements for Interior’s offshore drilling plan. The proposal<b> </b>was supposed to go into effect in 2019 and offer acres off the coast of Florida in late 2022 when a drilling moratorium officially ends.</p><p>“Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an agency can't act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. In this case, exempting Florida but not California (which has an even larger coastal economy) is arbitrary and capricious,” Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat and attorney, told POLITICO.</p><p>“So the agency would either have to not exempt Florida, or in the alternative, exempt Florida, California and any other state that can show the coasts are important to the state's tourism and economy.”</p><p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra also hammered that point on Twitter, echoing Scott’s argument against drilling off the Florida coast to say “California is also ‘unique&quot; &amp; our ‘coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.’ Our ‘local and state voice’ is firmly opposed to any and all offshore drilling. If that's your standard, we, too, should be removed from your list. Immediately.”</p><p>In Virginia, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine took a more low key approach. “Virginia’s governor (and governor-elect) have made this same request [as Florida], but we have not received the same commitment. Wonder why...” he tweeted.<br></p><br>",

A separate amount in damages for the BuzzFeed lawsuit, which was filed at the state court level, will be determined at trial, according to court documents obtained by POLITICO.</p><p>&quot;Enough is enough of the #fake #RussianDossier,&quot; Cohen tweeted Tuesday. &quot;Just filed a defamation action against @BuzzFeedNews for publishing the lie filled document on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and me!&quot;</p><p>Fusion GPS commissioned the so-called Steele dossier, a controversial compilation of alleged ties between Trump and Russia. Compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, the dossier has since been a focus of congressional probes investigating whether Russia interfered with the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.</p><p>A transcript of the interview with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson by the Senate Judiciary Committee last summer was published on Tuesday. Simpson told congressional leaders that the FBI found the dossier credible because an undisclosed &quot;human source&quot; associated with Trump had offered the bureau corroborating information.</p> <p>BuzzFeed published the dossier in January 2017, noting that the allegations were unverified and the report contained errors.</p><p>The dossier claims that Cohen met with Russian operatives somewhere in Europe, including Prague, to attend a meeting to “clean up the mess” created by public disclosures of other Trump associates’ reported ties to Russia.</p><p>Cohen has denied that a Prague meeting occurred, saying that he has never been to the Czech Republic.

        "content": "<p>A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's effort to shut-down the Obama-era program that provides quasi-legal status and work permits to foreigners who entered the U.S. illegally as children.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000160-de32-da22-ad65-fffa4f5d0001\" target=\"_blank\">a ruling</a> Tuesday evening, San Francisco-based U.S. District Court judge William Alsup ordered the administration to resume accepting renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA.</p><p>Alsup said Attorney General Jeff Sessions' conclusion that the program was illegal appeared to be &quot;based on a flawed legal premise.&quot;</p><p>Unless halted by a higher court, the ruling will allow former DACA recipients who failed to renew by an October 5 deadline a chance to submit renewal applications and will also require the administration to allow renewal of applications expiring in the future. The decision does not require officials to accept new applications for DACA status.</p><p>If the judge's order remains in place, it could also roil ongoing legislative efforts on DACA by undercutting the urgency many advocates have expressed, calling for legislation to be passed before large numbers of Dreamers begin losing their protected status in March.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Trump criticized the judiciary after the ruling. </p><p>&quot;It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA)...almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts,&quot; Trump tweeted. </p><p>Alsup's nationwide preliminary injunction order came on the same day many of those advocates were at the White House for a negotiating session aimed at hashing out the contours of a bill that would give DACA recipients a reprieve. </p><p>Trump's comments during an unusually-protracted photo op led to some confusion about his position, but he later tweeted that any fix on DACA must include significant funding for the border wall that he promised during his campaign.</p><br><p>&quot;As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern border, which must be part of any DACA approval,&quot; Trump wrote.</p><p>Alsup didn't reference the meeting in his decision, but he did say there were signs that the administration's decision to wind down DACA was not the product of legal necessity but rather an attempt to improve the White House's bargaining position.</p><p>The judge, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said Trump gave &quot;credence&quot; to that claim when he tweeted last month: “The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration &amp; ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!”</p><p>The Trump administration could seek a stay of the ruling from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. It's possible the Supreme Court would move to put the decision on hold pending further review. Just last month, the justices voted, 5-4, to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/supreme-court-daca-dreamers-protections-288620\" target=\"_blank\">halt orders from Alsup</a> requiring the administration to disclose more details about how it arrived at the decision to rescind DACA.</p><p>White House spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment on the new ruling, but Justice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley said the administration will continue to press its legal case for ending DACA.</p><p>However, he did not say whether that would involve an immediate appeal.</p><p>&quot;Today’s order doesn’t change the Department of Justice’s position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens. As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress, and was susceptible to the same legal challenges that effectively ended DAPA,&quot; O'Malley said in a statement.</p><p>&quot;The Department of Homeland Security therefore acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner. Promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position, and looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation.”</p><br><p>Some lawyers said they would not be surprised to see the Justice Department to move quickly to seek relief from the latest order.</p><p>“If we’ve learned anything the last year of litigation on high-profile...issues, it’s that these things get emergency appeals and they get stayed and they get stopped,” said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the National Immigration Law Center. “It shouldn’t for one minute take the heat off Congress to pass that bill of love. Come tomorrow, we could be facing an emergency appeal at the Ninth Circuit….This stuff moves very fast in cases of national importance.”</p><p>Some immigrant rights' advocates went further, expressed concern Tuesday night that the judge's decision could lead to confusion and undercut the drive for a more durable legislative fix.</p><p>&quot;To all of the dozens of DACA recipients messaging and texting me: yes, we agree entirely that this is more chaos and isn't going to be relief,&quot; Todd Schulte of FWD.us. wrote on Twitter. &quot;Congress needs to act more now [than] ever, plain and simple. I'm sorry people are confused on what this means. DACA is gone.&quot;</p><p>Alsup's ruling came in connection with five lawsuits he is handling challenging the decision the administration announced in September to end the DACA program. </p><br><p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who filed one of the cases, welcomed the ruling and said he thinks it actually strengthens the position of lawmakers seeking to protect the so-called Dreamers in the face of pressure from Trump to offer concessions on funding for the border wall, limits on legal immigration and more.</p><p>&quot;Why would anyone want to negotiate a bad deal to get DACA now that it’s become clear the court is saying the Trump administration may have tried to repeal the program in an unlawful way?&quot; Becerra told POLITICO. &quot;It's high time the Trump administration and stopped trying to load up the measure with all sorts of things that have nothing to do with the desperate plight Trump has put the Dreamers in.&quot;</p><p>Becerra also said he thinks the new ruling may help convince the Supreme Court that something was amiss in the way Trump officials analyzed DACA's legal viability.</p><p>&quot;The record is becoming stronger that the basis for the Trump action is unsupported by the law,&quot; the California official said. &quot;I have reason to believe we have a strong chance of having the preliminary injunction remain in place.&quot;</p><p>A spokeswoman for the University of California, which brought another of the suits ruled on Tuesday, also called for Congressional action.</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, even with this decision, fear and uncertainty persist for DACA recipients across California and the nation who want to continue to live, work, learn and contribute to the country they know as home,&quot; the spokeswoman said. &quot;UC will continue to support DACA recipients by challenging the legality of the Trump administration’s rescission of DACA, supporting congressional legislation that would allow for permanent protection, and providing services and aid to its undocumented students.&quot;</p><p><i>Ted Hesson and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>TRENTON — Chris Christie got his last word — for now.</p><p>The outgoing New Jersey governor, once among the Republican Party’s biggest stars — a man relentlessly pursued by donors to make a presidential run — spent his farewell speech to the New Jersey legislature trying to prove he has a legacy worth bragging about.</p><p>He hands power to Democrat Phil Murphy next week after eight tumultuous years with just 5 percent of the New Jersey public saying it will miss him. But Christie is likely to write a book and carry on in the public spotlight — and clearly thinks history will remember him fondly.</p><p>Christie’s 8,500-word farewell address featured quotations from Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill and <b></b>Alfred Tennyson’s poem “Ulysses” and made no allusion to his failures or the moments that cast a pall over his time in office. He made no mention of the cloud that hung over his administration after the Bridgegate revelations, his failed presidential run, his complicated ties with Donald Trump or last year’s state government shutdown.</p><p>“I ran to be different,” Christie told lawmakers. “I ran to talk bluntly. I ran to shine lights on all of New Jersey’s real problems. I ran to offer tough but achievable solutions. I ran to be a governor who did not just mark time. I ran to win. And I ran to be a governor of consequence.”</p><p>In his 87-minute State of the State address, he said he had much to look back on: He closed a $13 billion budget gap in his first two years, then took on the “insatiable beast of public employee pensions and platinum health benefits.” He says he kept the greedy hands of liberal lawmakers off taxpayer money, persuading Democrats to go along with a cap on property taxes. He improved the schools in Camden, shored up the local government in Atlantic City and kept property taxes in check across 565 municipalities.</p><br><p>Much of his speech was met with applause, a good portion of it bipartisan. In some surreal moments, Christie waxed poetic on his years in office and the people around him.</p><p>He thanked Steve Sweeney, the Democratic leader of the state Senate who became one of his biggest allies in the Legislature, even if the two had cross words over the years. </p><p>He thanked George Norcross, a millionaire insurance executive and the boss of the South Jersey Democrats, for being “my partner.” An open admission of their alliance might have been unthinkable seven years ago.</p><p>A new poll this week found that just 5 percent of the state’s residents believe they will miss Christie when he’s gone, and 13 percent said they view him favorably. He became one of the least popular governors in the nation's history last year; his approval rating landed at 15 percent after he was photographed sitting on a closed state beach in the middle of a government shutdown.</p><p>Some say they’ve had enough Christie to last a lifetime.</p><p>“Don’t let the door hit you on the ass,” Analilia Mejia, head of the liberal group New Jersey Working Families Alliance, said of the governor before she attended the speech.</p><br><p>Still, Democratic leaders in the state Legislature had nothing but kind words for the parting governor, who spent much of his speech recalling bipartisan efforts to take over Atlantic City and enact the pension and health benefits reforms that helped catapult Christie to the top of the national GOP.</p><p>“What you heard today is what is possible when two parties are willing to work together,” Sweeney, who once called Christie a “rotten prick,” said after the speech.</p><p>Even state Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a now-82-year-old grandmother whom Christie once suggested the press “take a bat” to, seemed to put aside her distaste for the governor.</p><p>“For a minute there I almost thought I was going to miss him,” she joked to reporters. “You can laugh, it’s OK.”</p><p>Portraying himself as a tough-talking former U.S. attorney who took on unpopular issues to do what needed to be done for a struggling state, he said he squared off with the public-sector unions and won. And he said he vetoed more tax hikes “than any governor in modern American history.”</p><p>And Christie offered some stern advice for Murphy, and the next Legislature, which has gained Democrats while the governor held office. </p><p>The new governor and lawmakers, he said, must work together to ensure a key piece of his first-term property tax laws get renewed. And they also must focus on the pension system, which he had once claimed to have fixed. It remains in deep trouble. He said the only thing that can save it is enacting further curbs on employee benefits, changes recommended by a bipartisan panel he had appointed.</p><p>“Let me assure all of you of one other thing: No matter what you do, unless it involves complete capitulation, you will be vilified by public union leaders,” Christie said.</p><br><p>Murphy, who continues to have a chilly relationship with the governor, briefly appeared at the back of the Assembly chambers an hour before Christie’s speech. He was greeting lawmakers in the majority leader’s office and taking selfies with those who asked.</p><p>“Just passing through here,” Murphy, appearing caught off guard, told inquiring reporters.</p><p>Asked whether he was staying for Christie’s speech, he said, “No, I am not.”</p><p>Hours later, he issued a frosty statement. </p><p>“Today, Governor Christie painted a sunny picture of a state in good standing,” he said. “Unfortunately, New Jerseyans have long known that we’re in a dire state of fiscal crisis: providing unnecessary tax cuts to millionaires and generous corporate welfare, while costs incurred by everyday residents — from college tuition to transit fares to health care premiums — have skyrocketed.”</p> <p>“Together, one week from today,” he said, “New Jersey will turn the page to a bright new day.”</p><p><i>Matt Friedman contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>President Donald Trump’s freewheeling, televised — and, at times, incoherent — immigration meeting with lawmakers Tuesday accomplished one thing at least, according to attendees: They agreed on what they would try to agree on. </p><p>Yet even that tentative outline is prompting pushback from other members who want to tug a final deal on Dreamers to the right or left — further complicating prospects for an agreement that can be signed into law before the young undocumented immigrants begin losing legal protections en masse in March. </p><p>Numerous attendees of the highly anticipated White House meeting left assured that a deal to address the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would include four main parts: legal status for Dreamers, more robust border security, an overhaul of family-based immigration laws and a change to a controversial visa lottery program. That only those elements were included was a clear signal to conservatives, who are demanding more expansive enforcement provisions in any fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Trump is killing. </p><p><br></p><br><p>“Kevin McCarthy was the one who said, ‘All right, it’s down to four things, right? DACA and the other three things?’” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top negotiator for Senate Democrats, referring to the Republican House majority leader. “And we all agreed.” </p><p>Added Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.): “Those are the outlines of what a potential deal could be. Now, what in fact takes place as it relates to each of those elements is incredibly important.” </p><p>The White House concurred, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying the group “reached an agreement to negotiate legislation that accomplishes critically needed reforms in four high-priority areas: border security, chain migration, the visa lottery and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.” </p><p>But some House Democrats say they won’t accept those parameters. They argue Democrats are agreeing only to legalize the Dreamers now, and that debates over “chain migration” and the diversity visa lottery need to happen later. </p><p>“The statement issued by the White House is inaccurate,” said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). </p><p>Meanwhile, there’s also a restive faction of House Republicans pushing their leadership to take a hard line early in the immigration fight, worried that the more moderate Senate will ultimately jam their chamber with a Dreamer deal they can’t accept. </p><p>The fact that a mere deal to discuss a deal is stoking such consternation on Capitol Hill illustrates the difficult predicament that lawmakers — not to mention the Dreamers themselves — face in coming up with a solution. And yet it’s not all that surprising that the talks have narrowed after the White House immigration meeting, as a bipartisan group of senators had already been focusing on those four core areas. </p><p>The group primarily includes Durbin and Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.); the senators have yet to reach an agreement, although they have been working feverishly for weeks discussing proposals. </p><p>For example, the senators have debated whether to effectively dump the visa lottery — which doles out about 50,000 green cards annually to people from countries with traditionally low rates of immigration — by reallocating those visas to immigrants who have benefited from Temporary Protected Status programs that the Trump administration is terminating. Separately, there appears to be a more notable struggle over chain migration, with senators disagreeing on whether restrictions on sponsoring relatives should apply just to the Dreamers or to a larger immigrant population. </p><br><p>It’s still unclear whether the senators will be able to reach an agreement they can successfully sell to Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, not to mention a more conservative House. But defining the mere outlines of a deal was at least a step closer to a final fix, senators said. </p><p>“We did make some progress on it today,” Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said. “The main thing was, let’s define out the basis of scope. Let’s break down who’s going to do what, and let’s start the process, because the hard negotiation is obviously going to be in smaller groups.” </p><p>Other Senate Republicans were encouraged that Trump said his long-coveted border wall with Mexico doesn’t have to cover the entire, 2,000-mile boundary. “We’ve been begging him to say this kind of stuff before,” Flake said. “It’s only about [700] or 800 miles total. Some of that is replacement. And more importantly, the wall is really a fence.” </p><p>But later Tuesday, discussion of the bipartisan summit only fueled more dissension among the Democratic ranks. </p><p>Democrats spilled out of a more than hourlong meeting in the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Tuesday afternoon differing over what had been decided at the White House as well as what they would entertain in upcoming negotiations. </p><p>Durbin and Hoyer left the meeting to huddle one-on-one in a separate room, only to emerge with contradictory talking points. </p><p>Hoyer maintained that McCarthy suggested those four areas as the basis for a bipartisan deal during the White House meeting, but that Democrats never agreed to those terms and still haven’t. Durbin, meanwhile, didn’t dispute his earlier comments that those four issues were on the table, telling reporters the “devil is in the details.” </p><p>“There are ways to do things that are painless and ways that are fatal,” Durbin said. “So you try to find painless alternatives.” </p><p>Other Democrats also left the meeting with different stances: Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois suggested they were open to discussing changes to family-based immigration and the visa lottery, while Sen. Kamala Harris and Rep. Linda Sanchez of California said those discussions should be part of broader immigration reform and not attached to a DACA deal. </p><p>“I don’t think a whole lot of folks in that room really even understand, and I mean no disrespect to them, it’s not their areas of expertise, really what [chain migration] means. … The current law allows for family reunification,” said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who successfully crashed the White House meeting after not receiving an invite. “And the same thing with diversity visas. When you really think about who’s getting those diversity visas, it has absolutely nothing to do with the issue we’re trying to address with DACA recipients, and we’re making that case.” </p><p>When told some House Democrats were disputing even the parameters of an agreement, a frustrated Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) responded: “There is no misunderstanding.” </p><p>“There were four issues that were agreed to be part of the DACA deal. … That was what the whole thing was about!” said Diaz-Balart, who also attended the White House meeting. “We have a real opportunity to get this done as long as folks don’t start backtracking from what was talked about today.” </p><p><br></p><br><p>But even if House Democrats ultimately get on board, there’s trouble brewing among the House GOP. </p><p>Senior House Republicans used a closed-door conference meeting earlier Tuesday to begin pressuring Speaker Paul Ryan and his top lieutenants to take a harder line on immigration. In particular, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia urged leaders to put a conservative DACA bill he will introduce Wednesday on the floor for a vote. It addresses some of the provisions being discussed in the immigration talks, but goes further by changing policies governing unaccompanied child migrants and asylum seekers. </p><p>House GOP leaders aren’t sure the bill can pass and worry about upending the bipartisan discussions going on in the Senate. But that’s unlikely to quell demands from rank-and-file Republicans that they pass a conservative solution instead of waiting on a bipartisan Senate deal. </p><p>“There’s not a commitment [to a vote] yet, but this is the only bill that can unify the people,” insisted Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho), who helped Goodlatte write the bill, which would surely be rejected by the Senate. “We can get to 218.” <br></p><br>",

The last redraw was in 2016, after a previous version was ruled unconstitutional for illegally using race to draw two seats.</p><p>But in this new decision, the panel ruled that the remedial map violated the equal protection clause when GOP legislative leaders drew the maps with an explicit conservative bias in an effort to favor Republican candidates. &quot;Rather than seeking to advance any democratic or constitutional interest, the state legislator responsible for drawing the 2016 Plan said he drew the map to advantage Republican candidates because he 'think[s] electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,'&quot; Circuit Court Judge James Wynn wrote in the ruling.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article193814154.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Raleigh News &amp; Observer</a> reported Tuesday night that Republican legislative leaders plan to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p><br><p>The state's congressional delegation is made up of 10 Republicans and three Democrats, even though recent statewide elections often reflect a nearly 50-50 split.

        "content": "<p>A federal judge has rejected the federal government's bid to toss out a lawsuit demanding official action to recover emails former Secretary of State Colin Powell sent during his four years as America's top diplomat more than a decade ago.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2016cv2145-24\" target=\"_blank\">a ruling</a> Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden called &quot;anemic&quot; the efforts the State Department and National Archives have made to obtain the messages, which Powell sent via an America Online account. </p><p>McFadden didn't immediately order State or the Archives to take further action, but he said that a conservative watchdog group — Cause of Action Institute — can proceed with its suit despite the Justice Department's arguments that the litigation is fruitless.</p><p>Lawyers for the State Department noted that Powell's representative told the agency that there were no emails left from the period in Powell's AOL account, which had been closed for several years. AOL's general counsel told a House committee that AOL's system had no emails from Powell's tenure as secretary from 2001 to 2005.</p><p>However, drawing in part on the FBI and State Department's success in retrieving of thousands of emails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent on a private account during her time at Foggy Bottom, McFadden said he believes there's a &quot;substantial likelihood&quot; an investigation by the Justice Department &quot;will yield access to at least some of Secretary Powell's emails.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;Here, all they have done has been to ask Secretary Powell to seek the emails himself, and then declare 'mission accomplished' when Secretary Powell's representative informed them that AOL believed the emails no longer exist,&quot; wrote McFadden, an appointee of President Donald Trump. &quot;If AOL were to be contacted directly by the Government, rather than by Secretary Powell's representatives, perhaps they would undertake a more thorough search for Secretary Powell's account, or the servers on which it was stored.&quot;</p><p>The judge also suggested that State and the Archives may have a legal obligation to refer the issue to Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his review.</p><p>McFadden pointed to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/appeals-court-revives-suits-over-hillary-clinton-emails-232990\" target=\"_blank\">a federal appeals court ruling</a> from late 2016 in which the D.C. Circuit held that a judge was too quick to dismiss similar suits pressing State and the Archives to do more to recover Clinton's emails.</p><p>&quot;Even if AOL's representations are accepted as truthful, the Court is still left without any knowledge of how AOL went about researching the question, and the extent to which Secretary Powell's emails have been permanently erased or perhaps merely deleted,&quot; McFadden wrote. </p><p>Powell's assistant declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment and a State Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment.</p><p>When Powell's email practices drew public attention amid the Clinton email controversy in 2016, Powell defended his email use as part of an effort to try to bring the State Department into the internet era in the early part of the previous decade. He noted that he boasted in his memoir about using his AOL account to that end.</p><p>&quot;I was not aware at the time of any requirement for private, unclassified exchanges to be treated as official records,&quot; Powell said.</p><br><p>The State Department inspector general eventually found some messages sent to Powell's private account and concluded that two of them contained classified information, although it was unclear whether they should have been treated as classified at the time they were sent by ambassadors and forwarded to Powell by his staff.</p><p>In an interview with POLITICO two years ago, Powell dismissed the classification claims.</p><p>&quot;They’re fairly innocuous and very benign, and neither ambassador classified them at the time. They were merely information memos sent to State.gov,&quot; Powell said. &quot;Now, 11 or 12 years later, as part of a whole process of reviewing things, somebody in the department says, 'Well, they're classified.' My response to that is, no they were not. ... You can say your judgment is they should have been classified, but at the time they were not classified.&quot;</p><p>An official with the Cause of Action Institute welcomed McFadden's ruling.</p><p>&quot;Agencies must take their responsibility to secure federal records seriously,&quot; said John Vecchione, the group's president and CEO. &quot;For too long, agencies have allowed federal employees to use personal email accounts without ensuring those records are recovered and maintained in accordance with the law. We are encouraged that the court recognized that agencies must do more to recover lost records.&quot; </p><br>",

        "content": "<br><p>The annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will be choking with the kind of people who disdain Donald Trump and genuinely regard his presidency as a menace to the planet. In other words:<i> exactly</i> the kind of party Trump loves to crash.</p><p>Lots of very rich people. Lots of media. Lots of fevered what-is-he-really-up-to speculation. At the psychological level, the appeal of Davos for Trump is obvious.</p><p>The startling — though, in some ways, eye-rollingly logical — news on Tuesday that Trump will join all manner of global financial, political and media elites in their famed Alpine lair later this month was for months quietly in the making, administration officials said.</p><p>WEF organizers had been lobbying for months for high-level administration participation, though they hadn’t been counting on more than a few Cabinet secretaries. </p><p>What planners didn’t know was that some West Wing advisers were arguing that Davos would be the perfect venue for Trump to unleash an especially gassy stink bomb aimed at ideas — free trade deals, a more integrated global regulatory system, and all manner of liberal pieties cherished by global elites — he deplores.</p><p>One constant of Trump’s rise to power is his desire to command the attention, if not the approval, of the very establishment institutions he claims to be contemptuous of. No surprise that news of Trump’s Davos attendance was first leaked Tuesday morning to The New York Times, which Trump denounces and gives interviews to in seemingly equal measure.</p><br><p>Trump’s controversial closing ad of the 2016 campaign featured video of GOP boogeyman George Soros speaking at a WEF event and included Trump railing against a “global power structure” that was crushing the American worker. </p><p>In 2017, days before his inauguration, Trump and Trumpism — with his denunciation of free trade, immigration and international institutions — dominated the conversation at Davos. But the absence of actual Trumpites — with the exception of a wise-cracking Anthony Scaramucci and a media parade that followed him everywhere — was glaring.</p><p>Now Trump will be the first sitting president since Bill Clinton in 2000 to attend.</p><p>The gathering at Davos, at the base of some of the most exhilarating ski slopes in Europe, also typically attracts financial titans like Bill Gates as well as liberal celebrity activists like Bono and Angelina Jolie.</p><p>Beyond the emotional charge of appearing before many people who regard him as a mysterious new virus — as well as some Wall Street types, like Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, who have been more supportive — there seems to be at least a whisper of a strategic rationale for Trump going to Davos.</p><p>One administration official said Trump’s appearance will be a “Nikki Haley at the U.N.” moment, referring to a speech from the U.N. ambassador in which she threatened to pull U.S. funding from the organization over its condemnation of the administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump will be trumpeting the same “America First agenda” he promotes at home.</p><p>Davos will also give Trump an opportunity to gloat to European and Asian competitors about the recently enacted tax bill that lowered the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent, something that could pressure other governments to consider lowering their own rates. </p><p>“Europeans are worried about what Trump and the Republicans have done, and they should be,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. “Because if they don’t follow suit, they risk losing out to investment in the U.S. I’d expect him to talk about that.”</p><br><p>“I think it’s a brilliant move,” said Larry Kudlow, the conservative economist who could be the next director of Trump’s National Economic Council. “He can sell his economic growth policy on the world stage and maybe take some whacks at the World Bank or the IMF. Remember, he went to NATO and told them to pony up, and they did.”</p><p>These quotes suggest a more purposeful strategy behind Trump’s public utterances than is necessarily obvious from his daily Twitter barrage, which often seems dictated by whatever excites him in the daily news cycle.</p><p>It is notable, however, that Trump’s Davos appearance — the exact day of his speech has not yet been announced — will come just days before his Jan. 30 State of the Union address.</p><p>That is one traditional presidential platform that requires even a nontraditional president to do more than simply free-associate: The only way this nationally televised speech can succeed is if he lays out a coherent vision of how he views his presidency and what he plans to achieve in the year ahead. Most recent presidents have conceived of the State of the Union not merely as one night but part of a weekslong campaign before and after the speech to set the national agenda.</p><p>Last year, Trump’s first address to Congress — the equivalent of a State of the Union address — was one of the few times in his presidency in which large parts of the Washington political and pundit class gave him credit for articulating a coherent and detailed vision of his policy agenda and the ideas behind it.</p><br><p>Now, on the heels of the successful legislative effort to overhaul the tax code, people will be looking for new answers to one of the overarching questions about this president: It is always obvious whatpeople and policies Trump is against, but what is he for?</p><p>A year ago, adviser Steve Bannon was seen as one of the intellectual engines of the new administration — touting a nationalistic agenda that is anathema to most at Davos — but now he is exiled.</p><p>Still by Trump’s side, however, are lots of people who feel perfectly at home at Davos — and who are expected to join him there, right before the big speech.</p><p>An administration official said the Trump delegation to Davos will be large and likely include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and son-in-law Jared Kushner, among others.</p><p><i>Matthew Nussbaum contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

Rick Scott on Tuesday in Tallahassee, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he was withdrawing Florida from consideration for new oil and gas drilling leases.</p><p>Zinke had created a political uproar in Florida last week when he announced his department was proposing opening waters off the Atlantic Coast and Florida Keys to new drilling leases as part of a five-year plan. The eastern Gulf of Mexico would have been opened to drilling after a moratorium expires in 2022.</p><p>Scott said he opposed the plan and requested a meeting with Zinke to ask that Florida be removed from consideration.</p><p>In making the announcement Tuesday with Scott at the Tallahassee airport, Zinke said seismic testing still would be allowed but there would be no new oil drilling or platforms.</p><p>A compromise was always in the works that would allow Scott to claim victory in a likely bid later this year for the Senate, <a href=\"https://www.politicopro.com/states/florida/story/2018/01/09/scott-might-still-score-deal-on-drilling-as-zinke-heads-for-tallahassee-174894\" target=\"_blank\">said one Republican</a> who spoke with Zinke prior to the announcement last week. </p><p>The Interior Department proposal included buffers of up to 125 miles off the Gulf Coast as part of a possible compromise.</p><p>Asked Tuesday by a reporter what the deciding factor was, Zinke said, &quot;The governor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have a tremendous governor that is straightforward, easy to work for, says exactly what he means,&quot; Zinke said. &quot;And I can tell you Florida is well-served. And we've gotten along not only on this issue but the Everglades.&quot;</p><p>Sen. <a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51221\">Bill Nelson</a> (D-Fla.), who likely will face Scott for reelection, issued a statement shortly after the announcement saying he doesn't believe it.</p><p>&quot;This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott, who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;We shouldn’t be playing politics with the future of Florida.”</p><p>The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee echoed Nelson, saying in a statement Tuesday night that Scott &quot;has and always will be a self-serving con-man.</p><p>&quot;It’s unfortunate that he and his friend President [Donald] Trump would manufacture a crisis to try and help his political ambitions, but in doing so they’ve shone a bright spotlight on Scott’s long record of backing oil drilling off Florida’s shores and beaches,&quot; DSCC spokesman David Bergstein said.</p><p>Scott said it was important to continue efforts to protect the environment. &quot;We have been talking quite a while about my concern about any drilling off the coast,&quot; he said. </p><p>Zinke said the announcement &quot;was the culmination of many meetings back and forth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Florida is obviously unique,&quot; Zinke said. &quot;The president has tasked me to develop an energy policy offshore. But also take into consideration the local and state interests.&quot;</p><p>Zinke also indicated that seismic testing off Florida's coast still is on the table despite objections from some environmentalists and some Florida officials.</p><p>Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club Florida chapter director, said he wanted to see details backing up the announcement.</p><p>&quot;[President Donald] Trump and Zinke backed down because they learned they were going to lose any support they have left in Florida, Jackalone said. &quot;Voters here won't put up with politicians who support offshore drilling because an oil spill on our beaches would wreck the State's economy and destroy what people love most about Florida.&quot; </p><br>",

        "content": "<p>The White House may be pushing back the release of its long-awaited infrastructure package yet again, just a month after saying it would come out by the end of January.</p><p>A White House official said Tuesday that there have been “no decisions yet on timing” for the release. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) separately told POLITICO — after a meeting with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other officials — that administration officials are still deciding whether to publish legislative principles for the plan before or after the president’s State of the Union address Jan. 30.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman did not immediately comment Tuesday.</p><p>It’s unclear whether this represents a major snag for the infrastructure plan, which Trump’s aides have talked up as a big priority for 2018. The plan — aimed at creating as much as $1 trillion in federal, state and private spending — could also be another big win for Trump on the heels of December’s tax overhaul, the president’s supporters hope.</p><p>Trump’s advisers have told him that pursuing an infrastructure bill will give Republicans the best chance of holding onto the House because the prospect of building new roads and bridges has broad appeal with the electorate. </p><p>But congressional Democrats have expressed skepticism about Trump’s approach, especially given the administration’s signals that it will come with relatively little new federal spending and will attempt to unroll a host of regulatory requirements for transportation projects. And Trump himself has expressed misgivings about the package’s expected incentives for government partnerships with private investors — most recently during a huddle last weekend with congressional leaders at Camp David, The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mixed-signals-on-infrastructure-plan-emerge-from-trump-retreat/2018/01/07/56aa5a8c-f3db-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Sunday. </p><p>Trump has been raising similar concerns for weeks in private conversations with lawmakers and his advisers, according to people familiar with the conversations. </p><p>D.J. Gribbin, the president's special assistant for infrastructure policy, refused to give specifics on the timing of the plan’s release when reporters pressed him Tuesday, following the meeting with Cardin and other lawmakers. Besides Chao, the meeting also included members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.</p><br><p>A White House official had <a href=\"https://www.politicopro.com/transportation/whiteboard/2017/12/white-house-to-send-infrastructure-principles-to-congress-in-january-222046\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> POLITICO in early December that Trump intended to send &quot;a detailed infrastructure principles document&quot; to Congress sometime in January. Even that was later than what Chao had predicted last spring, when she <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-transportation/2017/05/administration-to-release-principles-of-infrastructure-plan-in-coming-weeks-220313\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> Fox News that “the legislative proposal will probably be tackled by the Congress in the third quarter” of 2017.</p><p>More recently, the White House has decided to focus largely on infrastructure in the coming months, administration officials have said — setting aside for now a bid to make sweeping changes to the country’s welfare programs, a top priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan. That decision came after weeks of internal debate about the administration’s legislative priorities.</p><p>Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Tuesday’s meeting was less about specifics of the infrastructure plan and more about face time about the plan with the administration, which he called &quot;helpful.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I don't know that I learned a lot,&quot; Carper said. &quot;I just think there's value in sitting down and talking.&quot;</p><p>The plan is expected to call for as much as $200 billion in federal spending over the next decade, with the rest coming from private investment, state or local funding and cuts to other federal programs. An administration official has told POLITICO that a wide variety of projects would have to compete for federal assistance, ranging from roads, railroads, bridges and tunnels to rural broadband or veterans’ hospitals — and that communities hoping for money from Washington will have to be prepared to put up their own cash.</p><p>At the same time, the White House has proposed budget cuts for some existing federal transportation programs. And the Department of Transportation told New York and New Jersey late last month not to expect the federal government to pay half of the $13 billion cost of building a new tunnel under the Hudson River — despite earlier promises to that effect from the Obama administration.</p><p>Both developments have increased Democrats’ consternation about Trump’s infrastructure plan.</p><p>Cardin said the administration officials went over their proposal Tuesday but left many of the details unfilled. </p><p>“I think we have an understanding [of] the framework they’re working under,” Cardin said. <b>“</b>What we don’t have is specifics. What we don’t have is how it adds up. And I think the plea that we’re making is let’s have a real, open process, but recognize you've got to have the money.”</p><p><i>Andrew Restuccia contributed to this report.</i> </p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon stepped down Tuesday as executive chairman of Breitbart News, a swift and stunning fall for a leading figure on the American right who was recently rebuked by President Donald Trump and abandoned by his key financial backer. </p><p>Trump publicly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/03/steve-bannon-trump-conflict-322278\" target=\"_blank\">broke</a> with Bannon in dramatic fashion last week, suggesting his former top adviser had “lost his mind” in response to critical comments Bannon made about members of the Trump family and campaign in Michael Wolff’s incendiary new book, “Fire and Fury.”</p><p>Breitbart's announcement came on the same day that Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/trump-immigration-meeting-mental-health-329600\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a> comprehensive immigration reform at the White House and said he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/trump-davos-2018-329037\" target=\"_blank\">would attend</a> the elite World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month, and just weeks after he signed a bill cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy — all moves that cut against Bannon’s nationalist, populist vision and show how his influence has waned since he was hailed as the mastermind behind Trump's 2016 victory.<b> </b></p><p>“I’m proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform,&quot; Bannon <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/09/stephen-k-bannon-steps-breitbart-news-network/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a statement on Tuesday. Breitbart CEO Larry Solov said Bannon “is a valued part of our legacy, and we will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish.”</p><p>Bannon, a former investment banker and film producer who became executive chairman of Breitbart after its founder's death in 2012, joined the Trump campaign in August 2016 as chief executive. Later, as White House strategist, he kept a whiteboard with Trump's campaign promises written in black marker, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/27/the-education-of-donald-trump-237669\" target=\"_blank\">check marks</a> next to those that had been accomplished. After months of squabbling with members of the administration he considered too establishment or too liberal, he was fired in August 2017 by new chief of staff John Kelly and returned to Breitbart.</p> <p>In recent days, amid tension with the White House over his comments in “Fire and Fury,” Bannon privately acknowledged to friends that the firestorm surrounding him was interfering with Breitbart’s operations. He did not respond to questions Tuesday about what’s next for him.</p><p>On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/07/bannon-finds-his-regrets-arent-good-enough-for-trump-327504\" target=\"_blank\">in an effort to ease the bitterness</a>, Bannon issued a statement uncharacteristically backing down from some of the criticisms that had so enraged the president, including calling Donald Trump Jr. “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” for attending a meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer.</p><br><p>Bannon didn’t dispute discussing the meeting but said he meant to aim his attack at former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, not the president's son. </p><p>&quot;Donald Trump, Jr. is both a patriot and a good man,&quot; Bannon said in the statement. &quot;I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr. has diverted attention from the president's historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency.&quot;</p><p>The statement came after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested that Breitbart and Bannon should “consider” parting ways given the fallout at last Thursday’s daily news briefing; his expression of regret Sunday did little to quell the White House's frustration.</p><p>Robert Mercer, long Bannon’s primary backer, had already abandoned the former Trump aide in November, selling his shares in the site to his daughter Rebekah. Last week, Rebekah Mercer issued a rare public statement distancing herself from Bannon and reaffirming support for Trump, whom the Mercers backed in the 2016 election. </p><p>“My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements,&quot; she said. </p><p>Still, Bannon told people over the weekend that he wasn’t going anywhere, and he was still holding editorial meetings and hosting his radio show. But people close to him expressed frustration that he wouldn't publicly address the rumors that he might leave Breitbart. </p><p>Bannon had boasted when he left the Trump White House and returned to Breitbart that he had his <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/bannon-the-trump-presidency-that-we-fought-for-and-won-is-over./article/2009355\" target=\"_blank\">“weapons” </a>back. The site’s identity in recent years has been shaped around Bannon’s brand of fiery, right-wing populism, which he wielded in the fight against progressives and establishment Republicans. </p><br><p>“He was the operation. The content that you saw across the pages of Breitbart from the moment really that Andrew Breitbart died to the current day was molded in the image and voice of Steve Bannon,” said Kurt Bardella, who served as a spokesperson for the site from 2013-2016.</p><p>Even during the eight months Bannon served in the White House, Bardella said it was still clear his vision was driving the site — and its coverage was often seen as a proxy for his views. </p><p>“The problem is, Steve, despite all his flaws, had a clear vision and business acumen,” said Lee Stranahan, a former Breitbart News writer. “In politics, he’s probably done, but I’m not sure he cares.”</p><p>Both Bardella and Stranahan said the site found itself at a pivotal moment, with an uncertain future.</p><p>“I think Breitbart as a platform is now going to have to take on its own personality outside of Steve Bannon’s,” Bardella said. “What that will look like and how successful that will be is an unanswered question.”</p><p><i>Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

        "content": "<p><i>Below is outgoing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's last State of the State address, as prepared for delivery. </i></p><p>Before we begin, let us rise one more time for, not a moment of silence but a moment of celebration, for the extraordinary life of Governor Brendan Byrne. That is what he would have wanted -- not silence, but celebration.</p><p>Nine years ago yesterday, I went to pick up eight-year-old Patrick and five-year-old Bridget from school. On my way out of the school with them, on the front lawn of the Assumption School in Morristown, I announced to the assembled media that I was running for Governor of New Jersey. On that day, I said many things but the most important statement was this: “If you’re looking for the same old stuff, you’ve got the wrong person.” Little did I really know just how right I would be nine years later.</p><p>Nine years is a lifetime ago in today’s culture of DVRs that skip commercials, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and the short attention spans that come with these latest ways of communicating. We need to remember where we were nine years ago. On the brink of financial ruin as a state. More people unemployed than at any time in modern history. A culture in Trenton of avoiding the tough decisions. Of taxing more. Of spending more. Of borrowing at a breakneck pace. The highest property taxes in America growing at a record rate. We needed tough and plain-spoken leadership to deal with these problems. We needed to care less about being loved and more about being respected. That’s why we ran for Governor.</p><p>We ran to be different. We ran to talk bluntly. We ran to shine lights on all of New Jersey’s real problems. We ran to offer tough but achievable solutions. We ran to be a Governor who did not just mark time. We ran to win and to be a Governor of consequence. </p><p>And, even though it is easy to forget those days and minimize those crises of nine years ago, in crisis indeed we were in 2009. Without the new policies and new attitude a band of former prosecutors brought here nine years ago, the crisis would have defeated us. Now, in the same way, if we revert to the policies of the past, it is a short road back to disaster. As Einstein said while he was a Princeton professor, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them”.</p><p>Due to the fighting attitude we brought and the pro-growth policies we have fought for and achieved together, I am proud to be here today to tell you that the State of our State is very good and -- without question -- much better than it was eight years ago.</p><p>Eight years ago, we inherited a state with an unemployment rate nearly ten percent. </p><p>In our eight years, that unemployment rate was cut in half.</p><p>Eight years ago, we had lost 248,000 private sector jobs and businesses were leaving our state at a record pace. Today, we have helped the private sector create 334,400 new jobs and 108,252 new businesses were created in New Jersey in 2017 alone, an all-time economic record for our state. More New Jerseyans are employed today than at any time in our history -- a long way from the depressing record of eight years ago.Today, 4.3 million New Jerseyans go to work every day.</p><p>How did it happen? </p><p>Where did New Jersey’s economic growth and job creation come from?</p><p>In 2011, we passed broad based business tax cuts that led to $3 billion in lower taxes that our corporate citizens plowed into job creation putting hundreds of thousands of our citizens back to work.</p><p>We took an unemployment insurance fund that was $2 billion in debt eight years ago, paid off the debt, passed a constitutional amendment to prevent politicians from stealing from this fund again. Today, we leave it over $2 billion in surplus. By the way, this reform of our unemployment insurance fund has led to an additional $400 million in job creating tax cuts for our New Jersey businesses.</p><p>We passed the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, which has helped to make us more competitive at attracting and retaining jobs, putting even more of our citizens back to work.</p><p>We reduced job killing regulations by one-third over the previous Administration, freeing up resources to put New Jerseyans back to work, not waste this money on lawyers and accountants to understand the next thing government was ordering them to do or not do.</p><p>Finally, we held the line on new and increased taxes. I vetoed income tax increases. I vetoed corporate tax increases. I vetoed energy tax increases. Over the last eight years, I vetoed more tax increases than any Governor in modern American history. And each one of those vetoes was sustained by my Republican colleagues in the Legislature. Through the leadership of Senator Tom Kean, Jr., the late Alex DeCroce and Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, the beleaguered taxpayers of New Jersey were protected for the first time in a decade. On behalf of the people and businesses of New Jersey, who have much more of their own money in their pockets because of their leadership, I say thank you very much.</p><p>Lower tax policies have worked to revive a moribund economy and lead to seven consecutive years of private sector job growth. That is a very consequential accomplishment for all the people of our state.</p><p>Eight years ago, we inherited a budget that was bloated, out of balance and riddled with gimmicks. $2 billion in deficit in a fiscal year that was only 5 months from ending. A projected $11 billion deficit in the coming year. A total of $13 billion in projected deficits over our first 18 months. Too many employees doing too little and costing too much. One-shot gimmicks that accounted for over 13 percent of our revenue. Deferred raises; deferred payments; a ticking time bomb for the new Governor.</p><p>In addition, in the eight years before we arrived debt issued by state government increased by more than 10% per year, every year. Unsustainable growth of debt. In our eight years, we have reduced that rate of growth by three quarters, to only 2% per year or less. We have stopped the decade of exploding growth of debt initiated by our predecessors.</p><p>Today, budgets have been balanced for eight years in a row. Over 10,000 fewer state employees. Discretionary spending nearly $2 billion less than it was ten years ago. One shot revenues down to 2.8% from 13.2%. We are handing off a state that is growing and a budget that is balanced.</p><p>For eight years, we have said no to unplanned, exorbitant spending and we have used the veto and line item veto to enforce fiscal responsibility.</p><p>How much spending have we used the veto to stop for our taxpayers? We have vetoed and line item vetoed nearly $7.3 billion in spending that the Legislature wanted to do but which we simply didn’t have the money to pay for. That’s nearly $1 billion a year, every year that we kept in the pockets of our citizens and out of the hands of Trenton politicians.</p><p>As a result, the budget we hand off to the next Administration is in balance, with a surplus, and not the $2 billion deficit that we were handed eight years ago. Those are the actions of an Administration that treated our citizens money as if it was our own. Those are actions with real consequences for each of our constituents.</p><p>While the budget crisis was the most immediate task that we faced eight years ago, we did not win to just fix those problems. We had a vision for finally tackling the chronic problems in New Jersey.</p><p>In the ten years before we came to Trenton, property taxes increased 70 percent. An average of 7% a year; every year for ten years. That is a chronic problem which was crippling our citizens ability to buy and keep a home. That’s why when the Legislature wanted to go home in July of 2010 after passing the budget I used my constitutional authority to call you back to finally address the growth of these taxes. </p><p>Together we passed a 2% cap on property taxes with only four exceptions. It was tough medicine but tough medicine was needed to deal with this issue. We did it for our constituents and it worked.In 2017, property taxes increased by only 1.64 percent. Therefore, in the last seven years property taxes have increased 1.98 percent per year. That has saved our property taxpayers $18.2 billion over those years compared to the previous system in place.</p><p>Why else did it work? Because we also gave the towns and counties the tool to control their largest single expense -- police and fire salaries. We have great men and women who serve as police officers and firefighters in this state. They also are the highest paid firefighters and second highest paid police officers in America. They are objectively NOT underpaid -- not seven years ago and not today. To make the 2% cap real, we needed to cap the interest arbitration salary increases given to them every year. So, we did it in a bi-partisan way -- twice. It has saved over $500 million in salary increases over the last seven years which would have been paid for by higher property taxes. The 2% cap and the interest arbitration cap have worked. In a state that suffered with 7% property tax increases every year for a decade, that is an accomplishment of consequence forevery New Jersey homeowner.</p><p>So, here’s my first warning to taxpayers for New Jersey’s future: If we do not act in a bi-partisan way to renew the arbitration cap, your property taxes will skyrocket again. The cap expired nine days ago, our progress is at real risk and our Governor-elect has refused to ask the Legislature to act before this cap expired. If our public safety officers were underpaid I could understand the debate. But, even after seven years of this cap, they remain the highest paid officers in our entire country while our taxpayers still pay the highest property taxes in America. Failure to renew this cap would be a failure of leadership -- a failure which would cost our citizens money they need to support their families. As a property taxpayer, I urge you to pass the arbitration cap and not return to the days of 7% annual increases in property taxes.</p><p>When we came to Trenton I believed that we had a higher education system which was underperforming its potential and sorely needed capital investment to expand seats and modernize technology. Governors for decades had tried to address this situation and failed to do so. There was not the political will to do what would maximize our educational and economic potential and that of our students. We were more afraid of offending than of failing.</p><p>We refused to accept that reality. We signed the bi-partisan New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Education and Restructuring Act and fixed decades of lost opportunity. I want to thank all those who helped make this happen, but most particularly Governor Tom Kean who helped me develop the blueprint and Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald who led the fight for it in the Legislature.</p><p>Today, Rutgers has a medical school, schools of public health and a cancer institute. It has gone from 55<sup>th</sup>in NIH funding to 22<sup>nd</sup>. And we rid ourselves of the corruption and self-dealing that was going on at UMDNJ, a task I began as U.S. Attorney and was proud to finish as Governor.</p><p>Rowan University became a public research university, gained a school of Osteopathic Medicine, now operates two medical schools and its nationally acclaimed school of engineering. It is poised to double its student population and has created innovative partnerships with community colleges to allow those students to get a four-year degree without unthinkable student debt. No one has been a greater champion of increasing higher education opportunities for South Jersey than Senate President Steve Sweeney and Rowan would not be what it is today without his persistent leadership.</p><p>Then we needed to turn to the challenge of capital improvements to our colleges and universities. This had not been done by any Administration for 25 years and our schools showed it through lesser facilities and higher tuitions. Together, we made the case to the people of New Jersey and passed the Building our Future Bond Act, which invested $1.3 billion in public money and billions more in private money in expanding and modernizing our campuses all over New Jersey. Over 208 individual projects are happening and our campuses are being transformed. </p><p>Where other Administrations had failed our higher education institutions for 25 years due to lack of courage and lack of funding, we refused to accept that failure. Nothing is more consequential to our state’s economic future than educational opportunity. We did not play small ball. We acted together and New Jersey’s higher education system is far better today than it was eight years ago.</p><p>Another failing gem of our state eight years ago was the beautiful and historic resort of Atlantic City. From the Miss America pageant to the diving horse at the Steel Pier, from Boardwalk Empire to the establishment of casino gaming, Atlantic City has been a national and international destination for more than a century. But, as often happens, corruption in Atlantic City combined with actions in Trenton helped to bring this town to the brink of bankruptcy. Bad decisions and timid inaction based on political correctness led to Trenton nearly killing the goose that laid the golden egg for all of New Jersey. This is another problem I began to work on as U.S. Attorney by putting corrupt Atlantic City politicians in jail for stealing from their people. But, unfortunately, that was not nearly enough to heal Atlantic City.</p><p>As we entered office, casinos were closing, property tax rebates were piling up in the hundreds of millions, the streets were unsafe and the private sector was fleeing. Not only that, but as a result, property taxes were soaring for the citizens of Atlantic City. I turned to Jon Hanson, Chairman of the New Jersey Sports, Gaming and Entertainment Commission, to develop a blueprint for change. We created a tourism district, took over policing there, invested in national advertising and supported efforts by city government which were well intentioned but failed. We needed to do more but were being stopped by politicians inside and outside of this chamber trying to score cheap political points by burying their heads in the sand.</p><p>Finally, we fought those entrenched and misguided interests and acted in a bi-partisan way to replace the ineffective city government who was either unwilling or unable to bring about needed change. </p><p>Through legislative and executive action, we took over Atlantic City and look what has happened. We appointed former United States Senator Jeff Chiesa to lead the effort and he has done so with incredible skill and produced phenomenal results. Tax appeals that were weighing down the city with $303 million owed to casinos was negotiated down by more than 50% to just over $138 million. In 2017, we announced an 11.4% decrease in property taxes, an average reduction of $621 for every homeowner. This was the result of our budget cutting measures that reduced city spending by $56 million over the 2015 budget. This budget will stay level in 2018 as well. We reached a settlement with the police unions, leading to new 12 hour shifts, reduced salaries, reduced terminal leave payments and a reduced workforce of 252 officers. All agreements that would not have occurred without Senator Chiesa’s intervention. </p><p>As a result, Hard Rock is now investing hundreds of millions in redeveloping the Taj Mahal. The former Sands is being redeveloped. Revel has now been sold and will reopen under new management by the summer. Casino revenues are up. Non-Casino revenues are up. Internet gaming was established and is now thriving. The private sector is now coming back to Atlantic City. All without bankruptcy or selling public assets like the water authority -- all things that our naysayers said we would do. They were wrong then and the opportunist politicians of both parties who now say that reversing course is necessary are wrong again.</p><p>As the Associated Press said on New Year’s Day, Atlantic City could be on the verge of a major revival in 2018. This will be especially true if our six-year fight to bring sports gambling to New Jersey is finally successful in 2018. While many experts told me to abandon this fight, we stuck with it. Today, we await the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which can bolster Atlantic City even more. </p><p>This is due to our efforts, to not bowing to political correctness to not worrying about being loved today. If we bow to those concerns, we could turn this major revival into a major downturn. I want to thank Mr. Hanson and Senator Chiesa for their vision, their courage and their hard work. Atlantic City is ready for rebirth and to return to its former glory. That is not small ball. That is an achievement of real consequence for our entire state.</p><p>Another problem we confronted eight years ago was one that had been baffling to Administrations since the 1970s: what to do to turn around the City of Camden. Some had tried to turn it into a militarized zone to stem the tide of murders and shootings. Some tried to throw money at the problems in Camden due to the urging of corrupt politicians who later landed in jail due to the efforts of my U.S. Attorney’s office. That, of course, did not work. We decided to confront these problems using common sense, bi-partisanship and, once again, telling the hard truths that past Administrations were too politically correct to say out loud.</p><p>First, we established an unprecedented partnership with the Democratic Mayor of Camden, Dana Redd. We promised each other that we would check our politics at the door and put the interests of a resurgent Camden at the forefront. Dana Redd kept her word to me for eight years and for that I say to her today, “Thank you partner”.</p><p>Second, we needed to establish a plan to create the foundation of any successful city: public safety, good public education and economic opportunity. </p><p>We attacked the issue of public safety in 2012. It was the deadliest year in Camden history, earning it the distinction of the nation’s most violent city. We dismissed the failed Camden City Police Department which was overpaid and underperforming. We then partnered with the city and Camden County to create a countywide police force with a Metro division that would patrol Camden city. For the same amount of money, we would go from 160 police officers to 349. Another class of cadets will soon bring that number to 400. What have the results been? In 2017, murders are down 66% from 2012, robberies are down 46% and non-fatal shootings are down 45%. That is the lowest number of murders in more than 30 years. </p><p>Even more than the change in the numbers, there has been a change in the relationship between the police and the public. While violence erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, there was no such violence in Camden. Instead, under the leadership of Chief Scott Thompson, you see police officers at churches and street fairs, at baseball games and school crossings. At each of those places, they were with those who they protect and serve.</p><p>Next, we needed to change the failing Camden public schools. Unlike the takeover of Newark schools decades earlier, we worked with the school district and effectuated an agreed upon takeover/partnership.Working with the community, we picked a dynamic new Superintendent, Paymon Rouhanifard. We began a school by school evaluation with the goal of improving education in every classroom. Closing schools that aren’t working, opening three new charter schools and three new Renaissance schools and significantly cutting back wasteful central office staff. Since these changes have been made the results have been astonishing. In five years, graduation rates have gone from 49% to 70%. Dropout rates have fallen from 21% to 12%. The dropout rate for African-American students has been cut in half. There is still more to do, but a good public education is now very possible for most Camden students, something we couldn’t say five years ago.</p><p>Lastly, we needed to increase economic opportunity for all of those who live in Camden. Due to our designation of Camden as a Garden State Growth Zone, a promise made and kept from the 2009 campaign, 28 projects have sprung up across the City of Camden. These projects will have $1.4 billion in private investment, create nearly 2,000 new jobs and retain over 3,500 more jobs. The development will spur 7,000 construction jobs for our building trades. It is a who’s who of American business: Holtec, Cooper/MD Anderson Cancer Center, Philadelphia 76ers, Subaru of America, American Water, EMR Eastern, Lockheed Martin, Cooper University Health and the new $700 million Camden waterfront project with office space, residential units and a hotel. A waterfront hotel in Camden! Business is booming in Camden as is Rutgers University, adding a number of new buildings to its Camden campus.</p><p>The rebirth of Camden is happening -- not with government giveaways or tanks in the street -- but with a bi-partisan spirit and a can-do attitude. While so many have been responsible for this rebirth, one person has never wavered in his belief in this city. None of this could have been accomplished without the relentless will of George Norcross. Camden has no greater cheerleader and investor. I am honored to have George here today and even more honored to call him my partner in this rebirth of Camden.</p><p>My happiest days in public life were when I had the honor of leading federal law enforcement in New Jersey as the U.S. Attorney. They were my happiest times because I had one simple task -- insuring that justice was done in New Jersey. When I became Governor, it was clear to me that our criminal justice system needed major reform. The system was less effective than it should have been in preventing violent crime and much too harsh on those who’s non-violent acts were being unduly punished. Reform would not be easy due to the power of the bail industry, decades old prejudices and the rhetoric of opportunist politicians always looking to seem “tough on crime”. After seven years as U.S. Attorney, I didn’t need to <u>seem</u> tough on crime -- I <u>am</u> tough on crime. But being tough on crime doesn’t mean that you lack compassion. Being tough on crime doesn’t mean you don’t believe in second chances. Once again, bi-partisan cooperation was the path to success.</p><p>Sixteen years ago, I met the smart, articulate wife of U.S. Marshal Glenn Cunningham. She was his partner in every way -- they made a dynamic duo. He became a mentor of mine and later, the Mayor of Jersey City and a State Senator. Glenn Cunningham was a great public servant but I am sure he is bursting with pride from heaven as he watches his wife, my friend, Senator Sandy Cunningham. Together we have crafted criminal justice reform which got the only “A” rating in the nation, that is becoming a role model for other states and has gotten broad approval from all of you.</p><p>Release from jail pending trial is now no longer based on how much money you have in the bank but on the seriousness of the accusations and your criminal record. No longer can a repeat violent offender be released and terrify his victims or old neighborhood because he has millions of dollars in cash from drug and gun deals. By the same token, no longer must you stay in jail for a minor offense longer than you would have to serve if convicted because you or your family doesn’t have $500 for bail. No longer can an employer make a job applicant with a criminal record check a box and end their chances of redemptive employment -- together we have banned the box in New Jersey. Crimes of our youth can now be expunged in three years, adult crimes in six years and many more crimes are eligible for life changing expungement. County prison population is already down 17% and two state prisons have been closed, saving countless millions for taxpayers.</p><p>Violent crime in New Jersey is down 5.1% since we instituted the beginning of our reforms and over 25% during the eight years of this Administration. Being smart on crime has increased hope and second chances and decreased crime at the same time. I want to thank Attorney General Chris Porrino for his outstanding work on this issue. Most of all, I want to thank my friend of sixteen years, Sandy Cunningham. Your heart and your willingness to work with me has changed hundreds of lives already with tens of thousands to come. I think Glenn is proud of both of us.</p><p>Speaking of second chances, I devoted all of last year’s State of the State address to the disease that is killing more of us every year. The disease of opioid addiction. I will not go over everything I shared with you last year. First, I want to say thank you. I challenged you last year to pass ground breaking legislation immediately -- and you did. We are still losing too many of our citizens to this disease, but we are now taking concrete steps to try turn back the tide of death and suffering.</p><p>We have the nation’s strongest limit on opioid prescriptions and since we implemented our new restrictions those prescriptions have decreased by over 15%.</p><p>We established state sharing in our prescription monitoring program in 2014 with our neighbors in Delaware. Since that time, due to the push from New Jersey, we now have 15 partner states, including our neighbors in New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Is it working? We went from 198,000 cross border requests in 2015 to 1.1 million requests in 2016 to over 3.5 million requests in 2017. We can stop doctor shopping and pill mills across state borders and we are saving lives.</p><p>In 2011, we instituted Project Medicine Drop to rid our medicine cabinets of these deadly pills. Since 2011 we have collected 88 tons of pills at over 400 locations across our state including every Walgreen’s in New Jersey. We are getting these pills out of the hands of our children and disposing of them in an environmentally safe way.</p><p>Attorney General Porrino has instituted an online way for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other citizens to report suspicious use or sale of opioids and he has ended the toxic financial relationship between pharmaceutical companies and physicians which can influence prescribing habits by placing strict limits on what they can pay doctors.</p><p>We have expanded the availability of Narcan statewide, expanded Medicaid and obtained a waiver from the federal government to open more treatment beds, connected patients with recovery coaches following drug overdoses, converted a state prison to an in-patient drug treatment facility and made drug court available in every corner of the state.</p><p>Through our ReachNJ program, we are lowering the stigma of addiction and connecting desperate families with the hope that comes from addiction treatment.</p><p>Due to all of our work, I had the honor of Chairing the President’s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. With a bi-partisan group, including New Jersey’s Patrick Kennedy, we presented 65 comprehensive recommendations to the President. When they are implemented, we will have a real chance to stop the dying.</p><p>175 people a day in America. A 9/11 every two and one-half weeks. I am proud that we have planted New Jersey’s flag on the side of hope and treatment and recovery. We are truly leading the nation.</p><p>Finally, I want to thank an inspiration for all these efforts and the star of our ReachNJ television ads, Ms. Vanessa Vitollo. She has been in recovery for over three years now from her heroin addiction and she has become the beacon of hope for so many New Jersey families suffering with addiction. Vanessa is here today and I cannot thank her enough for her honest inspiration to 9 million New Jerseyans.</p><p>New Jersey’s infrastructure and the Transportation Trust Fund which supports it has been on autopilot since 1988. That was the last time any major changes to the program were made; the last time the funding sources were directly addressed. When I became Governor, I committed to the building trades and business community that in my eight years that I would be the first Governor in 25 years to responsibly expand infrastructure spending. </p><p>I wanted more than the usual five-year plan for infrastructure investment though. I wanted the TTF to stop being a political football for both parties. I wanted a plan that significantly increased our expenditures on infrastructure. I wanted a plan that constitutionally dedicated every penny of the gas tax. I wanted a plan that also represented tax fairness to the people of New Jersey. Together, we reached every one of my goals and our next Governor, no matter how long he serves, will not have to reauthorize the TTF. We crafted a plan where both commuters and taxpayers win.</p><p>We have an 8 year $16 billion plan which increases infrastructure spending by 25%. We increased the gas tax and constitutionally dedicated it for only infrastructure spending. And we devised a plan that actually lowers taxes on the citizens of New Jersey.</p><p>Together, we lowered the sales tax. Together, we exempted $100,000 in retirement income for our seniors. Together, we honored our veterans by giving them a significant tax exemption. Together, finally and most importantly, we went from the most punitive death tax in America to no death tax at all. No longer will our seniors have to move to another state to avoid this onerous tax. These measures, when taken together with the gas tax increase, lead to a net $200 million tax cut for the people of New Jersey. </p><p>More infrastructure spending every year. More guaranteed years of investment. A dedicated, reliable funding source. Tax fairness for the people of New Jersey. This is another example of bi-partisan cooperation that comes from us not only hearing each other, but truly listening to and respecting each other. And the winners are the drivers and commuters of our state. Securing eight years of reliable funding for our roads, bridges and mass transit and eliminating the death tax in New Jersey -- those are certainly consequential accomplishments.</p><p>October 29, 2012. For New Jerseyans, that is a date none of us will ever forget. Superstorm Sandy changed New Jersey forever. It changed me too. No person can see the destruction to lives and property that I personally witnessed across my home state and not be dramatically changed. The pain, the suffering and the raw emotion of our citizens made me promise that I would do all that I could to recover from that day and rebuild our state as strongly and as quickly as possible.</p><p>Whenever I am asked what I am most proud of in my eight years, it is the days, weeks, months and years since Sandy and the way our government handled it. The results were not always perfect; they never are perfect. What was perfect was the effort, the compassion and the focus. Every day for over five years.</p><p>365,000 homes significantly damaged or destroyed. Roadways in every corner of the state destroyed or impassable. Two-thirds of the state without power. Only a handful of gas stations open. No water treatment or wastewater treatment plants fully operational. Shelters to be staffed and supplied all over the state. Thousands of tons of debris strewn throughout the state. People wet and tired and cold and scared. Leadership was needed and leadership was provided from every sector of our state and nation. Non-profits, faith-based organizations, governmental entities all answered our call for help. We were grateful then and we are still grateful today.</p><p>As a state government, we devised and operated 97 individual new programs focused on housing, schools, insurance claims, small business, mental health, social services, family support, local and county government services, energy restoration, food supply, fuel supply and dozens of others. This had never been done before on this scale in our state; there was no blueprint. We started from scratch and responded to the needs of our people.</p><p>We facilitated the removal, with our towns and counties, of over 8 million cubic yards of storm debris. It was completed within 100 days of the storm by private contractors and cost $50 per cubic yard. Compare that to New York state, who hired the Army Corps of Engineers. They paid double the cost, $100 per cubic yard, for one-eighth of the debris and it took longer to remove it. We saved time and money for the people of New Jersey.</p><p>Five years later, 85% of all families who applied for housing help are back in their pre-Sandy homes. $2 billion in housing assistance has been distributed to those in need. For those in flood prone areas who did not want to go home, we have spent over $100 million to buy those homes at pre-storm values through our Blue Acres program to give those families a fresh start. We have built over 3,100 new affordable housing units with another 2,600 under construction. $350 million was successfully distributed to families in aid to help them pay their mortgages, rent payments and repair costs.</p><p>We stood up for our devastated towns by creating a new program that provided $133 million in grants to towns to fund essential services like police, public works and education without property tax increases. We paid for their 10% match to the federal government on debris removal. Secured $111 million in loans to bridge any gap a town had in providing longer term services.</p><p>We helped citizens under stress by providing 60,000 people with behavioral health screenings. Over 3,500 people received drug addiction treatment related to Sandy. More than 10,000 families received psychological services through schools or community service centers arranged for by our Administration.</p><p>To rebuild our small business community, we developed a new program called Stronger NJ Business loans and grants. We distributed $56 million in grants and $86 million in zero interest loans to more than 1,200 businesses. Through these programs we rebuilt our business community and Moody’s has now concluded that five years later the business community is stronger and more resilient than it was pre-Sandy. That has helped us have our best tourism year ever with over $44 billion in tourism spending.</p><p>We have invested to make sure the next storm that comes will not devastate us again like Sandy did. We rebuilt the destroyed Route 35 in Ocean County to a state of the art standard of storm resilience. Established an energy resilience bank for over $200 million in those projects. We were awarded $1.25 billion for NJ Transit resilience projects -- the highest award given to any of the thirteen states competing for those grants. 127 gas stations have become energy resilient so they can operate on generators in the event of another long-term power outage. Over $500 million to make our wastewater treatment plants more resilient.</p><p>We have engaged in a $1 billion coastal restoration project to build dunes and other protections to ensure that another Sandy type event does not devastate our Jersey shore. From Cape May to Union Beach we are building protections that our citizens will be able to count on for decades to come. Leaving our shore unprotected again was not acceptable after the devastation of Sandy. We have also built sea walls in Sea Bright, put up sheet piling in Mantoloking, mitigation on the Hackensack River, pump stations in Brigantine, tide gates in Little Ferry and piping systems in Belmar’s Lake Como. We are more prepared today than at any time in our history and it happened because we not only wanted to recover but rebuild stronger.</p><p>We will not stop our efforts until every family gets back in its home. The job is almost done but almost is not good enough. But we have recovered in half the time it took Mississippi and Louisiana to recover from Katrina; still well ahead of New York’s recovery from the same storm. To all those who worked on this recovery, most particularly Marc Ferzan and all the men and women of the Governor’s Office of Recovery and Rebuilding, you have my undying gratitude.</p><p>Superstorm Sandy was a defining moment of our last eight years. It was our greatest challenge and provided us with our most satisfying personal and professional moments. All New Jersey proved we were, in fact, stronger than the storm.</p><p>A smart, politically balanced and fully staffed judiciary should be the goal of every Governor. It certainly was mine and we worked hard to make sure the law was followed and that justice was available to all our citizens. State law requires that there is an even distribution between Republicans and Democrats on our Superior Court. The law was being ignored when we arrived in Trenton. There were 31 more Democrats than Republicans on the bench. We fought not only to appoint better judges but to insure the political balance that the law requires. While this did lead to moments of strife, in the end, we nearly delivered on all those goals. There are more judges on the bench today than at any time in our history. In fact, there are only 11 vacancies out of 462 judicial seats in our Superior Court. Justice is available to all in every county. Just as importantly, we have moved from an imbalance of 31 seats to an imbalance of only 5 seats favoring the Democratic party. I hope, as we move forward, Governors and Senators respect the rule of law and finish the job we started -- by keeping the bench full and politically balanced.</p><p>No State of the State would be complete, no responsible discussion of New Jersey’s future can happen in this room, without a discussion of the sword of Damocles that hangs over the head of every New Jerseyan: our pension system and how it dominates any hope of building on the success of the last eight years.</p><p>In 2009, I was proud to start a discussion that no Governor in America was honestly having: the discussion on our broken state pension system and how its unaffordable promises were choking the ability of state government and its citizens from investing in the future. No one wanted to really talk about it. The good news for me though was that the only other public official in New Jersey who had honestly discussed this issue was elected Senate President the same year I was elected Governor. A perfect storm some might say.</p><p>Previous Governors and Legislatures virtually ignored the growing menace of increased costs and no real contributions. Benefits were regularly made more generous, assumed rates of return were irresponsibly increased to hide the problem, and for 14 straight years not enough was contributed by the state to even cover that year’s costs, let alone the exploding unfunded liability. It was done by both parties. It was done when economic times were bad. It was done when economic times were booming.</p><p>The facts go back to the 1980’s and every decade since then. Governor Kean drastically increased benefits for police and fire personnel. It was paid for by quietly increasing the assumed rate of return in 1988. Governor Florio increased the assumed rate of return again only three years later from 7% to 8.75% to avoid any pension payments. Governor Whitman floated back loaded pension bonds which will cost us four times what we borrowed when we finally finish paying them off in the next decade. Governor DiFrancesco drastically increased benefits for all pensioners with no additional funds. Governors McGreevey and Codey made virtually no contributions to the pension funds in their shared four years. Governor Corzine stubbornly maintained the assumed rate of return over 8.25% to continue to hide this growing problem from the public and avoid even larger expected pension payments. Both parties, for thirty years, added to this problem. They didn’t talk about it. They not only didn’t fix it, they made it worse each and every year. Then, they deposited it in my lap in January of 2010.</p><p>We didn’t hide the problem from the people. We didn’t hide from confronting it ourselves. We traveled the state, held town hall meetings and sounded the alarm. In return, we were regularly attacked for it by union leaders who have never cared how we would pay for all of this -- only that the checks came every month, no matter the road to ruin it put the other 8.1 million New Jerseyans on for the future.</p><p>In 2011, we passed historic reform that made employees pay a more realistic share of their pension costs, pay some share of their health insurance costs and end cost of living adjustments until the funds were once again solvent. These reforms will save $120 billion for the system over thirty years and have staved off, for the time being, insolvency of the system. While the state had to adjust our payment plan from 1/7 per year to 1/10 per year, the reforms made sense then and make even more sense now. But we did not stop there.</p><p>To further secure the system, we dedicated the Lottery to the pension system for the next thirty years. This dedication, along with the state’s payments, will get the funds to 90% funded within 30 years and is another step this Administration has taken to secure the pension system.</p><p>We also have made unprecedented cash contributions to the pension system. In our eight years, we have contributed $8.8 billion to the system. This represents 2 ½ times more than the last five Governors before me combined. If such contributions had been being made all along, our problems would be almost non-existent.</p><p>We took a diversified, professional and bi-partisan approach to investing these funds for the last eight years under Republican Bob Grady and Democrat Tom Byrne, who is here with us today. Our returns have beaten those of most public plans even while taking less risk than 90% of them. The market value of the fund has increased by $10 billion since February of 2010 even while paying out $70 billion in benefits in those years.</p><p>Despite all of this, two things remain true: we still have a big problem to tackle and that problem will only be solved by making these benefits more realistic for both pensions and health insurance.</p><p>A bi-partisan commission has laid out a plan that can and will work if you all finally have the will to implement it. If we do not, let me assure you that there are not enough taxes to raise or other programs to cut to feed the insatiable beast of public employee pensions and platinum-plus health benefits. Let me assure all of you of one other thing: no matter what you do, unless it is complete capitulation, you will be vilified by public union leaders. We have seen that play out with me for eight years and if my Democrat friends think they are immune, I am sure your attention was drawn to this year’s legislative races. Actions speak much louder than words.</p><p>If you don’t believe me, look at our record, the facts; more money contributed than the last five Governors combined, the lottery completely dedicated to pensions, quarterly payments rather than annual payments. All were signed by this Governor, yet, I think few have been more publicly criticized by these union leaders than I have been. The solving of this problem will not lead you to be loved. The gratitude you ultimately receive will be from future residents who will not be living in a bankrupt state where 8.1 million people are working every year until June or July to just pay the retirement and health benefits for 800,000 retirees. That is unacceptable. That is unsustainable.</p><p>The choice before you is clear but tough. The “failure to act” option is running out of time. I have put every ounce of political capital I had on the line to bring about the positive changes we have made and I do not regret one minute of it, despite the impact it has had on my political standing. I have tried to live by the words of Winston Churchill when he said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts”. Continue I have done for eight years on this issue and I pray for our state today that you will do the very same thing in the months and years ahead.</p><p>Today is my 2,913<sup>th</sup>day as Governor. I have loved the job and I am so grateful to all the people of New Jersey for giving me the chance to serve the state where I was born and raised and where my four children were born and raised. I wish Governor-elect Murphy and his family every success and every joy that is possible for them over the next four years. Next Tuesday at noon he will be my Governor too. His success will be our success and I hope for him and our state nothing but blue skies ahead.</p><p>But when you have this job, it can be lonely. But if you are lucky you are never really alone. Those around you make the days filled with friendship and camaraderie. </p><p>I feel fortunate to have been joined in this venture by New Jersey’s first Lieutenant Governor, Kim Guadagno. She executed her uncharted duties with class and energy and good humor. I thank her for her service to me and the people of this state.</p><p>I have been fortunate to have at the helm of one of the other co-equal branches of government a person who approached his job in the same way I approached mine -- with passion, with vigor, with emotion, with resolve, with stubbornness and with, at times, some pretty colorful language. The achievements I spoke of today would not have been possible without a person of good will and honesty and character to fight with and to make deals with and to have fun with these last eight years. Senate President Steve Sweeney is a great leader and an even better man. I have enjoyed our eight-year journey and I will miss our early morning phone calls. Most of all, I am happy and relieved that as I depart, that you will remain right in that chair to help insure the safety and success of New Jersey’s future. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>There are not words sufficient to thank your family for what they endure and support and tolerate when someone they love serves as Governor. It has been a true joy to have my Dad, at 84 years old, to be here to witness all eight of these years and to represent himself and my Mom. Thanks for being a wonderful father. To my brother Todd and my sister Dawn, and their spouses Andrea and Russ, thanks for always understanding the missed events and missed phone calls and never holding it against me. To my four children, who have grown up in front of the people of New Jersey because of their Dad’s job, the true joys of the last eight years were almost always produced by Andrew, Sarah, Patrick and Bridget. To my wife of 31 years, the mother of our children and our incredibly classy and energetic First Lady --Mary Pat, only you know the true depth of the joys and challenges of the last eight years because only you have been there every step of the way. Thanks for each of those steps and thanks even more for your love and understanding.</p><p>In the end, a Governor cannot get elected, be worth electing and be worth keeping for eight years without a great team. Sixteen years ago, I was sworn in as U.S. Attorney and every day since I have been blessed to be surrounded and served by an extraordinary team. I cannot name them all but I do not have to --their service to me was just that -- selfless. They are represented by names like Rich Bagger and Jeff Chiesa. Maria Comella and Bill Palatucci. Charlie McKenna and Kevin O’Dowd. Amy Cradic and Tom Scrivo. Chris Porrino and Michele Brown. Paul Matey and Mike DuHaime. To my team, we worked very hard, very well and always for the right reason -- to do the right thing. </p><p>As the final hours of our partnership slip away, I am reminded of the great Tennyson quote from Ulysses and believe that it applies to each and every one of you and the road we have traveled together these last 16 years: “Though much is taken, much abides. And though we are not now that strength which in old days moved heaven and earth, that which we are, we are. One equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find and never to yield.”</p><p>For me and the team I brought with me to this place eight years ago that sums up what we came here to do. To <u>strive</u> to win for the people we serve. To <u>seek</u> that which is good and right in all that we do. To <u>find</u> solutions to problems that no one could solve before us. And <u>never to yield</u>; not to pressure or polls, not to lies or puffery, not to partisanship or the old phrase “that’s never been done here before”.</p><p>I leave you today grateful, happy and a better man than I was when I walked in here for the first time eight years ago. For that and so much more, I thank you. Most of all, I thank the wonderful people of the great state of New Jersey. I came to this job eight years ago proud to be one of you. I leave it next week even prouder to be one of you. God Bless you and farewell.<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>For nearly an hour Tuesday, President Donald Trump presided over an unusually public negotiating session on the subject of immigration, running the meeting while TV cameras rolled in an apparent effort to knock down reports that he is less than a fully capable commander-in-chief.</p> <p> Surrounded by 25 lawmakers inside the Cabinet Room, Trump held court over the meeting, alternately inviting Democrats and Republicans — by name — to address the bipartisan group. He ran point for 55 minutes over a relatively free-flowing discussion between lawmakers about the future of the DACA program, border security and the possibility of immigration reform.</p> <p>“You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform,” the president told the group.</p><p>The meeting gave Trump a chance to appear in control, and featured substantive discussion—unlike televised meetings with Trump’s Cabinet and other allies in which participants have showered the president with <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/04/trump-republicans-white-house-praise-324975\" target=\"_blank\">praise</a>, most recently last week — designed to allay Washington chatter about Trump’s fitness.</p><br><p>That reporters and television cameras were allowed to sit in on the negotiations was unexpected. The event had been billed on the official White House schedule as a pool spray, typically brief affairs where the president offers short remarks and sometimes answers a handful of questions before the press is hurried out. </p> <p>The Republican National Committee seized on the televised back-and-forth in an email bearing the subject line “betcha haven’t seen that before” that included screenshots of Twitter posts from reporters noting how extraordinary it was to watch the president negotiate in real time and praising him for opening the meeting up to the press. </p><p>“Many in the media have spent the last week hyperventilating over a phony writer’s opinions, but the American people just witnessed President Trump lead arguably the most transparent, substantive policy discussion with Congress — maybe ever,” the RNC email read. </p><p>Yet the president seemed to confuse his own policy positions as the discussion progressed. </p><p>The president urged lawmakers to codify into law protections for so-called “dreamers” — undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children — and pledged to “take the heat” if Congress pushes even further and reaches a deal on comprehensive immigration reform. </p><p>But he responded warmly to California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s suggestion that he support a “clean” bill on DACA — that is, one without any funding for the border wall Trump has promised since the campaign. “I have no problem,” Trump said. “I think a lot of people would like to see that.”</p> <p>The exchange prompted House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to interject that Trump’s position on DACA includes a demand for wall funding. Later in the meeting, Trump added, “You need the wall.”</p><p>At another point, Trump suggested Congress return to the practice of granting earmarks, something that was done away with amid ethics scandals in 2010. </p> <p>Conservative activist groups reacted quickly to the president’s seemingly off-the-cuff endorsement of the earmark system. “If Republicans bring back earmarks, then it virtually guarantees that they will lose the House,” Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement. “Bringing back earmarks is the antithesis of draining the swamp. Earmarks will only benefit the special interests that grow government at the expense of working men and women.”</p> <p> White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted Tuesday at her press briefing that reporters had not been witness to the entire discussion and that a deal about future negotiation parameters was only struck once the press left the room. She declined to say whose idea it had been to allow the press pool to observe the meeting.</p><p> “A number of individuals in the room felt it was a good thing to let you see the cooperation and the conversation between both sides and see how we’re working and leading to move the ball down the felt and come up with some real solutions,” she said. </p> <br><p> President Barack Obama convened a similarly public, albeit planned, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?292260-1/white-house-health-care-summit-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">televised session</a> with Republicans and Democrats in 2010 on health care reform.</p><p> Trump has spent the past week fuming about suggestions raised by Michael Wolff’s recently released tell-all, “Fire and Fury,” that he is impaired by mental decline, prone to repeating himself on an ever-condensing loop and unable to recognize old friends.</p> <p> The president drew attention to questions about his mental fitness in a series of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/06/trump-wolff-mental-health-327116\" target=\"_blank\">tweets</a> over the weekend, in which he boasted that he is “a very stable genius.” </p> <p> On Monday, questions were further revived when Trump appeared not to sing all the words to the national anthem as he stood on the field before the college football championship game in Atlanta. Online, social media users wondered whether Trump knew the words to the national anthem, a song he has vaulted into the national discussion by complaining about NFL players who kneel while it’s played at professional games. </p> <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), once a fierce Trump critic who has lately become a golf buddy and booster of the president, said Tuesday’s televised White House encounter was “the most fascinating meeting I’ve been involved with in 20-plus years in politics.”</p> <br><p>“I very much appreciate President Trump’s attitude, demeanor, and desire to get something done that will make our nation more secure — while being fair to the Dreamers,” Graham said in a statement. “President Trump has the right attitude. Now it is up to all of us in Congress to come up with a proposal that gets the job done.”</p> <p>Later, he told POLITICO in an interview: “I’ve never been in a meeting like that before. It was fun! It was like, oh this is the way it works. I thought it’d be a good civics lesson.”</p> <p>Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, another attendee at Tuesday’s meeting, said the president’s invitation to reporters to sit in forced lawmakers to go on the record about how to deal with DACA.</p><p>“All of those things were said publicly so it’s a little bit harder now for anybody that was in that meeting,” he continued in remarks to reporters. “It’s not going to be easy but I think the fact that you all, and therefore the American people, saw that puts a lot of pressure [on us] and that’s helpful. You need that pressure to get this done.” </p><p><i>Seung Min Kim and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.</i></p><br>",

She hasn’t said definitively whether she would consider running for the presidency.</p><p>In the White House press briefing later Tuesday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders doubled down on Trump’s earlier statements, saying that she wouldn’t focus on anyone’s campaign other than Trump’s own re-election.</p><p>“I’m sure if she decides to run, which I think the president states he doesn’t feel she will, I’m sure she will have help with that,” Sanders said.</p><p>When asked about Winfrey’s qualifications for the job, Sanders said that she “very much” disagreed with her policies.</p><p>“Is she a successful individual? Absolutely,” Sanders added. “But in terms of where she stands on a number of positions, I would find a lot of problems with that.

        "content": "<p>Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, whose firm commissioned a controversial dossier alleging secret ties between President Donald Trump and the Kremlin, told congressional investigators last summer that the FBI found the dossier credible because an undisclosed &quot;human source&quot; associated with Trump had offered the bureau corroborating information.</p><p>In a 312-page transcript of Simpson's August 2017 interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Simpson's attorney also said it was dangerous to discuss the dossier's sources because its public release last year had already led to murder.</p><p>&quot;Somebody's already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work,&quot; said the lawyer, Joshua Levy. </p><p>The transcript was released unexpectedly Tuesday by the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, angering the committee's Republican chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley.</p><p>It's unclear to whom Levy was referring. He didn't respond immediately to a request for comment. But Britain's Telegraph newspaper <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> last year about a former KGB chief who was mysteriously killed around the same time amid questions about his relationship to dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British spy contracted by Fusion.</p><p>Nor is it clear that the FBI was in direct contact with a “human source” close to Trump. Simpson did not name the person. But the New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html?mtrref=www.google.com&auth=login-email\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that Trump campaign adviser George Papadapoulos told an Australian diplomat last spring about his contacts with Russians who claimed to have Hillary Clinton’s emails, and that the diplomat alerted U.S. officials soon after.</p><p>Feinstein's decision to release the transcript represents an escalation of partisan tensions that have long been simmering on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Simpson had called for the transcript of his appearance to be made public, but Republican leaders so far had not agreed to release it. </p><p>&quot;The American people deserve the opportunity to see what he said and judge for themselves,” Feinstein said in a statement about her decision to release the Simpson transcript. “The innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice. The only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.&quot;</p><br><p>A spokesman for Grassley said Feinstein posted the transcript with &quot;no agreement&quot; from committee Republicans. </p><p>&quot;It’s totally confounding that Sen. Feinstein would unilaterally release a transcript of a witness interview in the middle of an ongoing investigation — a witness that Feinstein herself subpoenaed last year for lack of cooperation,&quot; said Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy. &quot;Feinstein’s unilateral decision was made as the committee is still trying to secure testimony from other witnesses, including Jared Kushner. Her action undermines the integrity of the committee’s oversight work and jeopardizes its ability to secure candid voluntary testimony relating to the independent recollections of future witnesses.&quot;</p><p>Simpson and his Fusion GPS co-founder, Peter Fritsch, complained <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/02/fusion-gps-steele-dossier-trump-russia-320236\" target=\"_blank\">in an op-ed</a> last week that Republicans had leaked selected details of the testimony and called for the full transcript's release.</p><p>&quot;Fusion GPS commends Sen. Feinstein for her courage,&quot; a spokesman said Tuesday.</p><p>Republicans have criticized the dossier for containing unsubstantiated — and in some cases highly salacious — charges, and are seeking more information about how it might have influenced the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation. After it was compiled by Steele, the dossier was handed over to the FBI in the fall of 2016. BuzzFeed published it last January.</p> <p>In his testimony, Simpson rejected suggestions from Trump allies that Fusion paid journalists to publish anti-Trump material. But he acknowledged briefing journalists before the election.</p><p>&quot;There were things that Chris knew and understood to be the case that only he could really explain in a credible way, and ... we thought that he should be the one that explains them,&quot; Simpson said. &quot;So we sat down with a small group of reporters who were involved in investigative journalism of national security issues and we thought were in a position to make use of him as a resource.&quot;</p><p>Simpson also said Steele initiated communication with the FBI in July 2016 with &quot;someone that he said he knew.&quot; At the time, Simpson said, Steele was told that his information tracked with what they had heard from a source from the &quot;Trump organization.” It was unclear whether he might have been referring to Trump’s business or his presidential campaign. Simpson said he wouldn't share the identity of that source for &quot;security&quot; reasons.</p><p>&quot;I know that I just don't feel comfortable sharing because obviously it's been in the news a lot lately that people who get in the way of the Russians tend to get hurt,&quot; he said.</p><br><p>Steele later briefed a senior FBI official in Rome, Simpson testified, but later &quot;broke off&quot; communications with the bureau.</p><p>&quot;Chris was confused and somewhat disturbed and didn't think he understood the landscape and I think both of us felt like things were happening that we didn't understand and that we must not know everything about, and therefore, you know, in a situation like that the smart thing to do is stand down,&quot; Simpson said explaining Steele's decision.</p><p>Elsewhere, Steele added that “there was concern that the FBI was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people.” He did not provide further detail. </p><p>He added that Steele told him the FBI didn't pay him for his work.</p><p>Simpson said Steele first took his concerns to the FBI in July, shortly after a trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails were posted publicly, calling the matter &quot;a national security issue.&quot; </p><p>Simpson said that Steele told him: &quot;I know the perfect person. I have a contact [at the FBI], they'll listen to me.&quot; </p><p>Feinstein's move came days after Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/trump-dossier-author-steele-fbi-326613\" target=\"_blank\">referred Steele</a> to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation. Feinstein said Grassley and Graham did not consult committee Democrats beforehand.</p><p>In the interview, committee aides told Simpson that Steele’s lawyers had revealed that Steele passed his findings to a “senior United Kingdom government national security official.”</p><p>Simpson then recounted, with new detail, the tale of how the Steele dossier reached the desk of then-FBI Director James Comey after the 2016 election — delivered personally by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</p><br><p>He said Steele bumped into longtime McCain aide David Kramer at a conference in Nova Scotia and ended up discussing the dossier. Later, Kramer followed up with Steele.</p><p>Simpson said Kramer told him that McCain wanted to &quot;ask questions about it at the FBI. ... All we sort of wanted was for the government to do its job and we were concerned about whether the information that we provided previously had ever, you know, risen to the leadership level of the FBI.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was our belief that Director Comey if he was aware — if he was made aware of this information would treat it seriously,” he added.</p><p>After revelations that Steele’s work was funded, indirectly, by the Clinton campaign, McCain <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/25/republicans-russia-trump-dossier-clinton-244183\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> POLITICO that he had no regrets about delivering the dossier to Comey.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>President Donald Trump and Democratic lawmakers sparred over immigration during a nearly hour-long meeting in front of reporters, during which Trump pledged to “take the heat” if Congress pursued a comprehensive reform package. </p><p>Trump voiced interest in striking a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era initiative that provided protections to roughly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants and which Trump rescinded in September. The bickering focused around whether such a deal would need to incorporate funding for his long-promised border wall and additional funding for border security.</p><p>During the summit — about 55 minutes of which was televised, an unusual move by the White House — Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged the president to “close the deal” on an immigration reform package. Trump offered to provide political cover for a comprehensive push.</p><p>“If you want to take it that further step, I’ll take the heat,” Trump replied. “You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform.”</p><p>Trump said after securing a deal on border security and finding a solution for young undocumented immigrants known as &quot;Dreamers,&quot; the group could discuss broader immigration reform “the following day.”</p><p>The White House said in a statement after the meeting that participants &quot;reached an agreement to negotiate legislation that accomplishes critically needed reforms in four high-priority areas: border security, chain migration, the visa lottery, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.&quot;</p><br><p>Still, while reporters were in the room, it seemed at times that participants were talking past each other.</p><p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) proposed that Congress take up a &quot;clean&quot; bill that would extend protections for Dreamers. The president replied that he had &quot;no problem&quot; with the proposal, prompting House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, to point out that it would not include the measures GOP Republicans and the White House want.</p><p>&quot;Mr. President, you need to be clear. What Sen. Feinstein is talking about, we don't want to be back here two years later. You have to have security as the secretary would tell you,&quot; McCarthy said. </p><p>&quot;That's what she is saying,&quot; Trump replied. </p><p>McCarthy rebutted: &quot;No, I think she is saying something different. You are saying DACA without security.&quot;</p><p>Trump also vowed that any agreement struck by Congress would be signed into law, even if he disagreed with portions of it. </p><p>“My positions are going to be what the people in the room come up with,&quot; he said. &quot;If they come to me with things I’m not in love with, I’m going to do it.&quot;</p><p>Democrats and Republicans struck notes of cautious optimism after the meeting, with both sides seeming to agree that “the wall” and “border security” are interchangeable terms, though White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would not specify at Tuesday's press briefing whether that interpretation was correct. </p><p>“I think the president uses ‘wall’ for ‘border security,’” said House minority whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). “I think he thinks they’re interchangeable.”</p><p>Sanders said Trump had not abandoned his wish to see Mexico pay for a wall along the Mexico border, despite pushback from U.S. and Mexican officials. </p><p>Republicans, who addressed reporters separately from the Democrats, praised Trump for bringing a new urgency to the process by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301\" target=\"_blank\">revoking DACA protections</a> last year. </p><br><p>Even with the details vague, Republicans expressed Trump-like optimism that a deal could be achieved.</p><p>“I think it’s doable,” said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.). “I think we’re all going to have to give a bit.” <br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>House Republicans are wading into an election-year fight over pork-barrel spending.</p><p>Republicans on the House Rules Committee plan to revive a debate over earmarks in hearings launching next week, even as members of their own party blast the banned practice as a symbol of the Washington swamp. </p><p>Rules Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) has assured members that the hearings are not intended to rush into a new policy. The committee will hold its first hearing on Jan. 18 for members, and another on Jan. 19 to bring in outside groups, according to a source familiar with the plans. </p><p>“There’s really an interest in both parties to reclaim these powers back to Congress,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an appropriator who sits on the Rules Committee, said Monday. “There were clearly problems with the old system. Someone went to jail. There’s a case to be made against them, but I think in the end, the case for them is more powerful.”</p><p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/09/trump-endorses-earmarks-329575\" target=\"_blank\">told lawmakers</a> at a meeting Tuesday that Congress could benefit from a return to earmarks. &quot;I hear so much about earmarks and how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,” Trump said of the system of congressional directives for spending on specific projects. “Of course they had other problems, but maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.”</p><p>Former Speaker John Boehner of Ohio led the effort to ban earmarks when Republicans took the House in 2010. The practice of designating money for pet projects back home had ballooned in the 1990s and early 2000s but problems spread. Disgraced Rep. Duke Cunningham of California was sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison for taking $2.4 million worth of bribes for earmarks, for example.</p><br><p>Cole, one of the few House Republicans who has lived through the earmarks era, said lawmakers have already come up with changes that prevent waste or misuse of spending, so that lawmakers can no longer “airdrop” a special program into a spending bill. That includes requiring members’ names on each requested provision. </p><p>Earmarks were eliminated after a series of infamous projects — like Alaska’s “Bridge to Nowhere” — drew scorn from both parties. But since then, some members of both parties have quietly asked House leadership to restore them, arguing that Congress has lost some of its spending power to the executive branch. </p><p>Some House members, particularly those who write spending bills, argue that banning earmarks had the undesired effect of ceding some of Congress’ “power of the purse” to federal agencies.</p><p>They also argue that earmarks can be a powerful legislative tool to fight gridlock. For example, if members are allowed to make the case for special projects in their districts, those members are less likely to block spending bills.</p><p>Critics, including many fiscal conservatives, warn that an earmarks comeback could open the floodgates to more spending. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) dismissed the idea to reporters on Monday, predicting there would be “little appetite” for the debate.</p><p>Democrats are unlikely to back any push to bring back earmarks in an election year, even though some members privately would support it.</p><p>House Republicans last discussed ending the earmarks ban in fall 2016, though the new system would have maintained tight guidelines. That effort was abruptly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/gop-lift-earmark-ban-231500\" target=\"_blank\">cut off</a>, however, as GOP leaders sought to avert what they feared could become a public relations nightmare for a party promising to “drain the swamp.”</p><br><p>House Speaker Paul Ryan then asked the Rules Committee to take over the debate by holding public forums, instead of a secret ballot behind closed doors. </p><p>Ryan told reporters Tuesday that he wants members “to have conversations” about the idea, as well as other budget process changes.</p><p>Part of the push for the hearings is that members are frustrated that projects are stalling at the local level. For instance, Ryan said the Army Corps of Engineers, which is handling more local projects since the end of earmarks, has “not been up to snuff about getting its job done.”</p><p>Proponents argue that earmarks have always comprised a small portion of federal spending, while allowing members to initiate new programs or projects in their own districts. Without them, lawmakers argue that federal agencies have taken over much of the decision-making in how federal dollars are spent locally.</p><p>Still, Cole said he’s worried about the public's reaction.</p><p>“The case for them is overwhelming, but the political case against them plays right into the sentiment right now,” he said.</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Days after her father’s inauguration last January, new-to-Washington Ivanka Trump tweeted a picture of herself clad in a $5,000 silver Carolina Herrera gown, en route to a black-tie dinner. </p><p>After she was widely criticized for her let-them-eat-cake moment — President Donald Trump’s daughter looked terrifyingly tone-deaf vamping for the camera while thousands of travelers sat stranded at airports because of her father’s sloppily imposed travel ban — Ivanka Trump admitted to friends she had made a clumsy PR mistake. </p><p>Almost a year into her transformation from striving Manhattan lifestyle guru to Washington power player, Ivanka Trump on Monday night proved what many of her colleagues acknowledge privately about the player behind the controlled façade: She is still prone to rookie political mistakes. And she seems blind to her circumscribed position as a self-professed champion of women who is simultaneously an unquestioning aide to a president who’s been accused of groping women. </p><p>“Just saw<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Oprah\" target=\"_blank\"> @Oprah’</a>s empowering &amp; inspiring speech at last night’s<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobes?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\"> #GoldenGlobes</a>,” Ivanka Trump tweeted Monday night, with a link to Oprah Winfrey’s viral speech. “Let’s all come together, women &amp; men, &amp; say<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIMESUP?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\"> #TIMESUP</a>!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/United?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\"> #United</a>.”</p><p>The very mainstream sentiment was confounding on multiple levels, when expressed by the president’s daughter. Ivanka Trump last year stood by her father when he was accused by more than a dozen women of unwanted sexual advances and outright assault. And her husband, Jared Kushner, even broke the Jewish Sabbath to huddle with the wounded candidate after the release in October 2016 of the “Access Hollywood” tape.</p><br><p>On top of the odd sexual politics of Ivanka Trump’s selective support of the #MeToo movement, the tweet was read as an unexpected endorsement of Winfrey, the entertainment mogul who lit up the hopes of desperate Democrats that she might be the answer to dethroning Trump and his family in 2020. </p><p>In her speech, Winfrey spoke of a “new day” dawning on the backs of empowered women “fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say ‘Me too’ again.” </p><p>The first daughter didn’t consult with her aides Monday night before expressing herself on Twitter. A spokesman on Tuesday declined to comment on Ivanka Trump’s private support for the #MeToo movement, or her tweet. </p><p>Friends and colleagues said the person they know would be oblivious to anything incongruous about her Winfrey support — and likely frustrated by backlash she sees as unfair. </p><p>“She thinks she is part of the feminist club,” said one New York socialite who used to be friendly with Ivanka Trump on the benefit circuit. “She truly thinks of herself as the greatest champion of women. She would see no irony in it whatsoever.” </p><p>Ivanka Trump, according to people who have worked with her, fundamentally views herself as someone who has made a career out of empowering women, even before her move to Washington, through her self-help book for working women and her affordable clothing line. </p><p>Despite promoting an administration that has threatened traditional women’s interests, like rolling back Obama-era regulations on equal pay and signing into a law a bill that allows states to withhold money from Planned Parenthood, Ivanka Trump believes she can advance women’s issues from within the White House. </p><p>But that view is out of sync with how she has come to be viewed in Washington, one year in. She was once seen as a potential moderating influence on a hard-right administration, but lawmakers on Capitol Hill said they have come to see her as relatively ineffectual in changing its course — even on one of her signature issues, paid family leave. While she proved to be an effective surrogate for the administration on tax reform, her fight for an expanded child tax credit was ultimately seen as a modest policy victory. </p><br><p>Heading into Year Two of the Trump administration, Ivanka Trump is still striving to elevate herself through an embrace of her father, while believing she can maintain a lane of independence. </p><p>“What’s the alternative — be silent and not give support?” one sympathetic White House aide said of her Monday night tweet. “I think she can show support for an important cause independent of the reports about her father.” </p><p>In recent months, she has tried. Last November, Ivanka Trump angered the president when she expressed outrage at sexual-misconduct allegations lodged against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. “There’s a special place in hell for people who prey on children,” she said at the time, in a rare public break from her father’s stated position — that Moore’s accusers were lying. “I’ve yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims’ accounts.” </p><p>It was a rare moment when Trump expressed frustration, to other aides, about his daughter’s public stance. </p><p>But it’s unlikely to happen with any regularity, according to people familiar with the first daughter’s thinking. “A central tenet in her life,” according to one confidante, “is that her dad is and will be an amazing president.” </p><p>Supporters of the #MeToo movement were quick to call her out for trying to have it both ways. “Great!” the actress Alyssa Milano replied to Ivanka Trump’s support for Winfrey’s message on Twitter. “You can make a lofty donation to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund that is available to support your father’s accusers.” <br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Ivanka Trump acknowledged the viral #MeToo movement in a tweet Monday, but President Donald Trump's family members drew raised eyebrows in the past with their comments about sexual harassment in the workplace.</p><p>After Sunday’s Golden Globes awards, the president's older daughter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/950561402053447685\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> her praise for Oprah Winfrey’s speech, saying “Let’s all come together, women &amp; men, &amp; say #TIMESUP ! #United.” Time's Up refers to an initiative by women in Hollywood to combat harassment. Some critics questioned Ivanka Trump's decision to weigh in given the sexual misconduct allegations made against her father during the 2016 campaign, which the president has denied.</p><p>Here's a look at some of the Trump family's past comments on workplace harassment:</p><p><b>Donald Trump</b></p><p>In August 2016, following sexual harassment allegations against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, USA Today asked the then-candidate how he would feel if Ivanka Trump faced similar behavior at work.</p><p>“I would like to think she would find another career or company if that was the case,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/08/01/ailes-trump-sexual-harassment-fox-news-women-gretchen-kelly-greta-news-column/87915454/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent interview, Trump seemed to try to adjust his comments.</p><br><p>“I think it’s got to be up to the individual,” Trump told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-and-eric-trump-opine-on-sexual-harassment--and-draw-fire/2016/08/02/9814549e-58c5-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html?utm_term=.9eed2a2b4bd4\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post</a> in an August interview. “It also depends on what’s available. There may be a better alternative; then there may not. If there’s not a better alternative, then you stay. But it could be there’s a better alternative where you’re taken care of better.”</p><p>“Some people would rather change and some people don’t,” he told the newspaper. “Some people don’t want to be forced to stay in a certain atmosphere.”</p><p><b>Eric Trump</b></p><p>In response to his father’s comments to USA Today, Eric Trump, the president's third child, said he didn’t think his older sister would put herself in a position to be sexually harassed in the first place.</p><p>“Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman, she wouldn’t allow herself to be objected to it,” Eric Trump <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-trump-weighs-in-on-his-fathers-comments-on-the-khan-family/\" target=\"_blank\">told CBS’ Charlie Rose</a>. “And I think she would, as a strong person, at the same time, I don’t think she would allow herself to be subjected to that. I think that’s a point he was making, and I think he did so well.”</p><p><b>Donald Trump Jr.</b></p><p>Donald Trump Jr., the president's oldest child, has suggested in the past that women who cannot handle harassment should consider a career change.</p><p>“I’m of that mindset — and I’ll get into trouble, I’m sure I’ll get myself in trouble one of these days,” Trump Jr. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/passantino/donald-trump-jr-suggested-women-who-cant-take-sexual-harassm?utm_term=.ooerVP6ON#.apyLlVNQG\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> on a 2013 episode of The Opie and Anthony Show. “If you can’t handle some of the basic stuff that’s become a problem in the workforce today, then you don’t belong in the workforce.

The annual gathering in the Swiss Alps has become a signature event for critics of “globalism,” making Trump’s decision to attend something of a surprise, especially after he concluded his first year in office by slashing tax rates on corporate America. </p><p>Trump’s final ad of the 2016 presidential campaign railed against a “global power structure” and included a video of billionaire investor George Soros speaking at a World Economic Forum meeting.</p><p>“Davos really is the global swamp, and I can’t think of a person more out of place at the World Economic Forum than President Trump,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. “I guess you have to give Davos credit for wanting to listen to different points of view, but I think Trump will be hard-pressed to add anything really valuable to the mix.” </p><br><p>Trump’s plan to attend was first reported by the New York Times.</p><p>President Barack Obama didn't attend the Davos gathering, known for its dizzying schedule of big-think panels and celebrity guests like Bono, Sharon Stone and Angelia Jolie. But many members of his administration did attend. Six of Obama’s cabinet secretaries and Vice President Joe Biden jetted off to Davos in the administration’s final year.</p><p>Davos attendance has been known to dent GOP careers in the past. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor became a regular, earning sharp criticism from some conservatives who view the meeting as a schmooze-fest for bankers and corporate elites who benefit from lax immigration laws, easy money central bank policies and the kinds of free trade deals Trump ripped during the campaign. </p><p>In a shocking upset, Cantor lost a primary in 2014 to tea party-backed conservative David Brat. Cantor quickly left Washington and joined investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. as vice chairman. <br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Joe Arpaio, the controversial former Arizona county sheriff who was convicted of defying a federal court order last year and then almost immediately pardoned by President Donald Trump, said Tuesday he is running for Senate.</p><p>Arpaio will run in the 2018 Republican primary for the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, he told <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-arpaio-running-for-senate-in-arizona/article/2645354\" target=\"_blank\">the Washington Examiner</a>, which first reported the news.</p><p>Arpaio served as sheriff of Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, for 24 years before being defeated for reelection by a Democrat in 2016. He has often teased a possible statewide campaign — raising money for his political committee before ultimately deciding not to run.</p><p>“I have a lot to offer. I’m a big supporter of President Trump,” Arpaio told the Examiner. “I’m going to have to work hard; you don’t take anything for granted. But I would not be doing this if I thought that I could not win. I’m not here to get my name in the paper; I get that everyday, anyway.”</p><br><p>Former state Sen. Kelli Ward — the conservative firebrand who lost to Sen. John McCain in a 2016 primary — is already in the contest on the Republican side, and Rep. Martha McSally is also expected to run. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is running for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>Arpaio's harsh stance toward undocumented immigrants drew praise from hard-liners, but criticism from Democrats and some moderate Republicans. It also earned him the ire of federal courts, which ruled he violated civil rights law. After Arpaio ignored the rulings, he was convicted of contempt of court in July 2017. One month later, Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/25/trump-pardons-former-sheriff-arpaio-242053\" target=\"_blank\">pardoned him</a> despite Flake's opposition.</p><p>Arpaio said in a phone interview on Tuesday that he hadn’t spoken with Trump about his run for Senate. </p><p>“I still support him. It doesn’t matter what his position is on me running,” Arpaio said. “But I’m sure he’ll know he’ll have a big ally in Washington, and he sure needs [someone] to get his programs and agenda done.”</p><p>While Arpaio is best known for his tough stance against illegal immigration, he stressed that also has experience in business and federal law enforcement, which took him to Mexico and Turkey decades ago. “I’m not a one-issue candidate,” he said.</p><p>The 85-year-old said he isn’t worried his age will be an impediment to serving a six-year Senate term, pointing to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), former Vice President Joe Biden and director Clint Eastwood, all in their 70s or 80s. </p><p>“I think it’s good,” he said, “because I survived my controversial 24-year career [as sheriff], strictly on common sense and life experience.”</p><p>Arpaio said the decision to run for Senate wasn’t an easy one. He’ll be a target for Democrats and progressive groups. In addition, any political campaign comes with a hefty workload. Still, he couldn’t resist the idea of the Senate race.</p><p>“I’m not going to be buried and know — and be sad — that I didn’t give it a shot,” he said.</p><p>Arpaio met several times in the past year with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon but said Tuesday he hasn’t discussed the Senate run with him. Bannon endorsed Ward in October, but she’s recently tried to <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/azdc/2018/01/04/kelli-ward-downplays-ties-steve-bannon-after-donald-trump-unloads-him/1004750001/\" target=\"_blank\">downplay</a> that relationship.</p><p>Of Bannon’s reported quotes in the explosive Michael Wolff book published last week, Arpaio said he couldn’t pass judgment. </p><p>“He has to speak for what was in the book. I can’t speak for him,” the former sheriff said. “That’s something that he has to talk to the president about.”</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>After more than three decades, Republicans are free of a federal court consent decree that sharply limited the Republican National Committee's ability to challenge voters' qualifications and target the kind of fraud President Donald Trump has alleged affected the 2016 presidential race.</p><p>Newark-based U.S. District Court Judge John Michael Vazquez ruled in <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000160-db8a-dcd4-a96b-ffabe0680001\" target=\"_blank\">an order</a> released Tuesday that the longstanding decree ended Dec. 1 and will not be extended.</p><p>The decree, which dated to 1982, arose from a Democratic National Committee lawsuit charging the RNC with seeking to discourage African-Americans from voting through targeted mailings warning about penalties for violating election laws and by posting armed, off-duty law enforcement officers at the polls in minority neighborhoods. </p><p>To extend the decree, the DNC needed to show that the RNC violated the terms of the pact. Democrats pointed to a series of incidents during the 2016 election in which they alleged people who claimed or appeared to be working for the RNC were engaged in poll watching. A November 2016 <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/10/sean-spicer-gq-magazine-story-fallout-244784\" target=\"_blank\"> POLITICO report describing RNC spokesman Sean Spicer's Election Day activities</a> led the judge <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2017/11/29/judge-allows-dnc-to-depose-sean-spicer-on-election-night-activities-125849\" target=\"_blank\">to order Spicer to submit to a deposition</a>.</p><br><p>Vazquez, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said in his ruling that despite the various claims, the Democrats had not shown any violation &quot;by a preponderance of the evidence.&quot;</p><p>An RNC official praised the ruling. </p><p>&quot;We are gratified that the judge recognized our full compliance with the consent decree and rejected the DNC’s baseless claims,&quot; said RNC communications director Ryan Mahoney.</p><p>&quot;Today’s ruling will allow the RNC to work more closely with state parties and campaigns to do what we do best, ensure that more people vote through our unmatched field program.”</p><p>While the end of the decree means the RNC is now free to step up its efforts on voter fraud and to take a role in coordinating Election Day poll monitoring, it is unclear whether the national party will resume such work, which has been left to individual campaigns and state parties in recent years.</p><p>Some GOP leaders have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/29/republicans-ballot-security-267717\" target=\"_blank\">urged the national party to continue to avoid those activities</a> to avoid alienating minority voters, who often view those efforts as discriminatory.</p><p>However, during the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed concern about voter fraud, sometimes referring to &quot;certain areas&quot; where, he alleged, that kind of election-related misconduct is rampant.</p><p>Spokespeople for the DNC and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><br><p>Although the decree technically permitted the RNC to engage in some Election Day activities at the polls and to seek advance permission for so-called &quot;ballot security&quot; work, the national party and its attorneys went to considerable lengths in recent years to urge national party officials and staff to steer clear of such activity, in part to avoid triggering allegations that could lead the consent decree to be extended.</p><p>One of the allegations that led to the decree involved use of a practice called voter &quot;caging&quot; — using returned mail to seek to have voters removed from the rolls.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will take up a case about a similar practice in Ohio, examining the legality of a procedure that state uses to cancel the registration of voters who haven't voted in two federal elections and don't respond to a mailed notice from election authorities. The Obama administration argued that Ohio's approach violated federal law, but the Trump administration reversed course and is backing the Buckeye State's effort to slim its voter rolls. </p><br>",

        "content": "<p>In a sleepy southern town, an unexpectedly violent scene: a mob of angry whites chanted racially charged slogans on one side, while equally incensed counter-protesters advocated for civil rights on the other side. National headlines, decades-old grievances and the nation’s deepest racial wounds were on display. Talk of “the start of the white civil rights movement” filled the air as America’s liberals warily evaluated the appeal of a revanchist white supremacist movement that would bring the likes of David Duke to the national stage.</p><p>Thirty years before the clashes in Charlottesville, this was Forsyth County, Georgia, after a series of protests over the region’s long legacy of racist violence and de facto segregation that brought national media attention. And then, as today, an ascendant media figure inserted herself into that morass in an attempt to create understanding where there seemed to be laughably little hope of it—Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>Winfrey’s segment, filmed on location in Forsyth County, was more of a ratings success than a true healing moment. But that hasn’t dissuaded her, America’s premiere therapist, cultural interlocutor and spiritual guide (to name just a few of her distinctions), from turning her eye to our most politically sensitive topics time and again over her now four-decades-long career in broadcasting. Accepting the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille award Sunday night for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment,” Winfrey placed herself at the center of the conversation again, offering a rousing defense of the press, touting its ability to expose “tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies,” and championing the #MeToo movement of women speaking out against “a culture broken by brutally powerful men.” It was a speech perfectly pitched to capture liberal imaginations—and it worked like magic, setting off a day of frenzied media speculation and earnest chatter on the left. Would Democrats really support a celebrity presidential candidate? Does Oprah have what it takes to knock out Donald Trump?</p><p>But just what, exactly, does Oprah believe? Noble and well timed though they may be, Winfrey’s gestures in support of women’s rights and compassion in the public sphere do not a political platform make. From the start, the former talk show host has skillfully walked the tightrope between political advocacy (as a reliable Democratic donor and vocal Obama booster) and political engagement. But running for office would mean staking out political ground, and potentially alienating people on the other side of the fence, which is not exactly part of the universalist Oprah brand. Winfrey has consistently placed herself just close enough to the political fray to exert her gravity on it, but not close enough to be burned by its heat—a privileged status a presidential campaign would sorely test, not least of all a contest against a brawler like Trump. Squaring off against the president would call for an opponent with the confidence to wade into the muck of America’s racial discontent, but also the gracefulness to find the common ground Trump so frequently salts behind him—exactly the kind of high-wire act a young Oprah Winfrey attempted at the start of her broadcast career.<br></p><p><b>***</b></p><p>The mid-1980s were a heady time for black politicians, especially in Chicago – Harold Washington, the city’s first black mayor, was elected in 1983, future U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun represented a portion of the city in the Illinois House of Representatives, and a young Barack Obama, fresh out of college, absorbed it all during his work as a community organizer on the city’s South Side. Winfrey was breaking barriers of her own, having overcome widespread skepticism on the part of stodgy white producers and executives to become not just a star broadcaster but an Academy Award nominee for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s <i>The Color Purple.</i> On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1985, Winfrey hosted then-Mayor Washington alongside musician Stevie Wonder on a star-studded episode of <i>A.M. Chicago</i>, an early incarnation of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>.</p><p>That appearance, however, would be a rarity—for her first decade-plus on the air, Oprah declined to book politicians as guests on the show, citing their conversational slipperiness as fundamentally at odds with her confessional interview style.</p> <p> “I didn’t want to delve into the world of politics, because I felt that I lost control of any situation where I was seated with a skilled politician,” Winfrey said of her early years in an interview with WBEZ’s Jenn White last year. “I can’t get them to actually respond, because a skilled politician knows how to give the answer they want regardless of what question you ask.” She added: “When you’re dealing with someone who’s skilled in that way, it’s their game. They’re using you and you’re giving them the platform to be used.”</p><p>The heightened political environment, however, clearly energized her—for much of its early run, <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show </i>tackled flashpoint political topics like the Forsyth County case, and Winfrey donated $1,000 to Moseley Braun’s successful 1992 Senate campaign.</p><p>Over the years, Winfrey’s resistance to booking politicians softened, and not because of a sudden willingness to perform the conversational kabuki of the traditional stump-speech interview—she instead discovered that the world of politics had bent to her will. Echoing a common sentiment of late-nineties punditry, James Bennet of the <i>New York Times </i>noted in a 1997 column how “Bill Clinton has Oprah-fied American politics, turning it into a playground for inner children and a forum for feeling pain.”</p><p>In other words, the political had become personal. And nobody did personal better than Oprah, who had by then gone national, made a fortune through syndication on the advice of her friend Roger Ebert, and established “live your best life” as the self-improvement mantra of a nation of loyal viewers, overwhelmingly women, searching for fulfillment in the relatively bucolic Clinton era.</p><p>Hence, in 2000, the exception to the rule: Winfrey invited both Al Gore and George W. Bush on the show to make their respective cases to millions of viewers, under the auspices of revealing “the real man” – allowing said viewers to decide “what feels like the right candidate for you.”</p><p>Gore’s appearance was predictably serviceable, but Bush made the real impression, bounding onto the set and planting a kiss on Winfrey’s cheek with impish Texan glee. Winfrey told WBEZ’s White that the gulf in appeal between the two candidates was obvious.</p><p>“George Bush was more comfortable in his own skin,” Winfrey said in an interview for the station’s “Making Oprah” podcast series. “That’s what everybody is looking for… who you decide to align yourself with is the person who feels most like the truth to you. Either you feel it or you don’t.”</p><p>The rest was history, with Bush narrowly eking out a presidential win—by a margin in Florida much, much smaller than the viewership for an average episode of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>. Most stopped short of ascribing Bush’s win to his appearance, but Oprah’s status as a media kingmaker was now undisputed.</p><p>Perhaps feeling sufficiently insulated from controversy, Winfrey made the uncharacteristic decision in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks to air a series of episodes directly tackling what was then the most hot-button issue imaginable—the debate over military intervention in the Middle East. Beginning with an episode titled “Is War the Only Answer?,” Winfrey hosted a succession of guests like Thomas Friedman and Lebanese-American Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges who debated the pros and cons of a potential invasion, with framing that was heavily skeptical of American interventionism, including clips from Michael Moore’s then-controversial <i>Bowling for Columbine.</i></p><p>The backlash was swift. Winfrey described in her own <i>O Magazine </i>receiving hate mail that read “Go back to Africa,” and the follow-up to “Is War the Only Answer?,” “What Does the World Think of Us?,” was delayed until late November of the next year, although episodes on the history of Islam were aired in the interim.</p><p>Since then, Winfrey has remained tight-lipped on most policy matters, although she was an ardent supporter of Barack Obama in both his 2008 and 2012 presidential bids (and a slightly more lukewarm ally of the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign). She’s staked out safe liberal ground on topics like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2013/05/oprah-talks-gun-control-immigration-165078\" target=\"_blank\">guns and immigration</a>, and used her platform to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_8Y72Rcvs\" target=\"_blank\">humanize the LGBT community</a> long before it was Democratic dogma, but for the most part avoided the side-taking and claim-staking that comprises much of public life for today’s political figures.</p><p>She now primarily serves as a reliable Democratic donor and a fixture of the liberal-philanthropic complex, donating tens of millions through her charity Oprah’s Angel Network. For the most part, she’s laughed off talk of pursuing office—joking that she would have “fallen off her treadmill” if she’d been watching when disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich floated her as a potential Senate appointee on a 2009 episode of <i>Good Morning America.</i></p><p>Until, as these stories tend to go, Trump came along. The seemingly impermeable barrier between celebrity and the presidency now breached, rumblings of a 2020 bid by Winfrey started almost immediately, with voices like Michael Moore floating hers and Tom Hanks’ names on CNN just days after the 2016 election as “beloved celebrities” who could take down Trump. At the time, Winfrey didn’t mince words in response, saying unequivocally on <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>’s “Awards Chatter” podcast that she would “never run for public office.”</p><p>But in September came a flip-flop. She noted pointedly during an interview with <i>Bloomberg News </i>that “it’s clear you don’t need government experience to be elected president of the United States,” and that “now [she’s] thinking, ‘Oh.’”</p><p>Which leads to this moment, with Winfrey the closest she’s ever been to casting in her lot with the politicians to whom she’s previously served as confessor and kingmaker, a chorus of supportive voices behind her and a fiery stump speech in her back pocket. Universally recognized, near-universally beloved – by any conventional metric she’s a dream candidate. But for someone whose brand is built on their ubiquity, she may only be just that: a dream.</p><p>Politics is comprised of moments where one <i>must</i> enter the fray, defending tough choices on drone warfare, taxation and the social safety net; does Oprah have the stomach to start making enemies? For someone whose motto is “live your best life,” the presidency doesn’t exactly sound appealing. Lyndon Johnson described it as “being like a jackass caught in a hailstorm.” Harry Truman said the job was like being “a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering, kissing, and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway.”</p><p>Given her already-massive cultural imprint and the misery of the job, the likeliest case may be that Oprah hears her advisers out and ends up deciding she’s perfectly happy cutting checks, puttering around her estate with Stedman and offering a sympathetic ear to the next Obama-level celebrity seeking a high-profile cable interview.</p><p>But if she does run, perhaps it will be because, in the lament of another former president—William Howard Taft—she hears a call to action. “I’ll be damned if I am not getting tired of this,” Taft once reportedly said. “It seems to be the profession of a president simply to hear other people talk.”</p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Entertainment mogul Oprah Winfrey is “intrigued” by the idea of running for president, Winfrey’s longtime friend and “CBS This Morning” anchor Gayle King said Tuesday morning.</p><p>King was clear in an exchange with her CBS co-anchors that she spoke with Winfrey on Monday night but was expressing a hunch, not relaying anything Winfrey had told her. Still, King said she sees a possibility that Winfrey might go back on her long-held position that she will not run for office.</p><p>“I do think she's intrigued by the idea. I do think that. I also know that, after years of watching the Oprah show, you always have the right to change your mind,” King said. “I don't think at this point she’s actually considering it, but listen, there are people who have said they want to be her campaign manager, who want to quit their jobs and campaign for her.”</p><p>Winfrey was honored at Sunday night’s Golden Globes award show with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s Cecil B. DeMille award for her lifetime contributions to the entertainment industry. Her acceptance speech, which touched on notes of national unity and combating sexual harassment and assault, earned her rave reviews and sparked talk that she might mount a presidential campaign to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.</p><br><p>Winfrey is no stranger to murmurs that she might run for office and has previously shut down such talk, telling “CBS This Morning” last October that “there will be no running for office of any kind for me.” But Trump’s surprise ascendance from reality TV star to commander in chief has seemingly opened the possibility for others who might previously have been considered unlikely or nontraditional candidates.</p><p>King, though, said Winfrey’s stance that she will not run for office has not changed.</p><p>“No, I absolutely don't think that her position has changed. I don't. You know, I was up talking to her very late last night,” she said. “She loves this country and would like to be of service in some way, but I don't think that she's actively considering it.”<br></p><br>",

        "content": "<p>Vice President Mike Pence said Monday that the incendiary book about the Trump administration that has roiled the White House for the past week is a “work of Washington fiction” that does not ring true to his experience working with the president.</p><p>“I haven’t read it, don’t intend to read it,” Pence told the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mike-pence-plans-active-role-in-gops-2018-campaign-1515457704\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a>. “What I’ve heard about in the book bears no resemblance to the president that I serve with every day. None. It just strikes me that it’s another work of Washington fiction.”</p><p>The White House has worked hard over the last week to characterize Michael Wolff’s new book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” as inaccurate and riddled with falsehoods. The book, released last week after a series of excerpts were published online, paints a picture of the West Wing as inept and back-biting and of the president as ignorant, narcissistic and potentially declining in mental state.</p><p>Trump administration officials and allies have particularly chafed at the notion that the president’s mental faculties are not at full capacity. They have also disputed the notion that he has approached the day-to-day job of being president with anything less than his full vigor.</p><br><p>“I have never been around anyone in my life with his energy, with his focus, with his capacity to multi-task. I think that this building has not seen his likes since that one,” Pence said, gesturing at a painting of former President Theodore Roosevelt.<br></p><br>",
