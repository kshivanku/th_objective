That is until you catch sight of the football stadium, which dwarfs the other buildings in this town of 1,800 people, about 25 miles west of Budapest. The Pancho Arena, completed in 2014, is surely among the world’s most striking football grounds, <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/538826/pancho-arena-tamas-dobrosi-doparum-architects\">more cathedral than stadium</a>, with a swooping shingled roof, copper turrets and ornate wooden vaults thrusting upward around the interior.</p><p>Bearing the nickname that Real Madrid fans gave to Hungary’s greatest footballer, the striker Ferenc Puskás, in the 1950s, the Pancho Arena is home to a club also named in his honour, Puskás Akadémia FC, which was founded in 2007, and was recently promoted into the Hungarian first division. The stadium has a capacity of 3,800, more than twice the size of the town. But much as Puskás himself had little connection to Felcsút – he began his club career in Budapest, and never set foot in the small town – the stadium isn’t really here for the locals.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/11/viktor-orban-hungary-prime-minister-reckless-football-obsession\">Continue reading...</a>",

        "content": "Inter-Korean talks are an encouraging sign of de-escalation on the peninsula. But the underlying threat of Pyongyang’s weapons programme and a reckless US administration will not go away<p>Like so many dictatorships, North Korea loves a good show. Sending its figure skaters and cheerleaders to next month’s Winter Olympics in the South is symbolically useful at home and abroad: promoting an image of national vigour; of a country that is recognised as part of the international system, not a pariah; of a country ready to do business again. As with the images of officials from North and South greeting each other in the demilitarised zone on Tuesday – their first meetings for two years – it is a welcome sign of de-escalation. Is the worst over? Almost certainly not. The pattern is familiar from previous crises: tensions rise, inter-Korean ties are cut, and bellicose rhetoric raises fear of a conflict – until approaches are made, talks resume, and the North looks forward to aid or some other benefit. But the risks were much greater this time, and at the next stand-off they will be greater still.</p><p>The first factor is North Korea’s rapid progress in its weapons programme. Few analysts believe denuclearisation is still a possibility; now the sensible goal of any negotiations would be a freeze. The second factor sits in the White House. This crisis was not just of North Korea’s making; <a title href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-01-09/myth-limited-strike-north-korea\">look too</a> to Donald Trump’s thin skin, ignorance, inconsistency and belief that threats (or occasionally a vague gesture towards a possible deal) will solve any international dispute. He vowed to respond to North Korea with <a title href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/08/donald-trump-north-korea-missile-threats-fire-fury\">“fire and fury like the world has never seen”</a>, underscored by a frightening vision of “<a title href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/us-north-korea-war-mcmaster-646942\">preventive war</a>”. Last week he boasted that his “nuclear button” was bigger and more powerful than Kim Jong-un’s. But the problem of the US president and his view of nuclear weapons goes beyond the peninsula. As a candidate, Mr Trump is said to have asked why the US could not use its nuclear weapons. Six months into his presidency, he <a title href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-wanted-dramatic-increase-nuclear-arsenal-meeting-military-leaders-n809701\">reportedly called for a tenfold increase in the country’s nuclear arsenal.</a> Now <a title href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/us-to-loosen-nuclear-weapons-policy-and-develop-more-usable-warheads\">the Guardian has revealed</a> that the administration plans to loosen constraints on the use of nuclear arms and make smaller, more “usable” weapons whose deterrent value is questionable, not least because of their operational dangers. The draft of the nuclear posture review shows what happens when the usual pressure from the US weapons laboratories, nuclear hawks in the Pentagon and their friends in Congress meets encouragement from the top despite the defence secretary’s resistance. North Korea remains the most immediate reason to fear this reckless president.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/10/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-and-trump-the-crisis-isnt-over\">Continue reading...</a>",

Take an established star, preferably one who has recently lost weight, and get them to create a diet plan based on their “journey”. Dishes are cut from a standard list of “stuff considered healthy these days”, so be prepared for endless incarnations of avocado, a recipe for Mexican scrambled eggs, and a dizzying array of spiralised vegetables. Most present a complex set of rules and restrictions, with recipes so aspirational and unrealistic for everyday living that most people will fail. It moves from something that happens to you, to something you can buy with enough effort.

While the red, white and blue cover is certainly eye-catching, its design has been criticised as too bland and simplistic for a book that has had such an explosive impact. “Why did they have to make the Fire and Fury book cover on Microsoft Word?” reads one derisive Twitter take, while a design website gave it faint praise for echoing “the raw immediacy and faux-outsider aesthetics that underlined Trump’s entire campaign”.</p><p>After he was approached by “some folks who think the existing cover is a disaster and a missed opportunity”, designer Edel Rodriguez (who made two striking Trump covers for Time magazine) came up with a new cover for Wolff’s book. His bright and bold design, featuring a fiery Trump looming over a tiny White House, is now being celebrated as the cover that should have been, with some readers even downloading it to replace the original on their e-readers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/10/why-is-the-cover-of-fire-and-fury-so-ugly\">Continue reading...</a>",

But the great love of his life involved heartbreak and – perhaps almost as painfully – the infringement of the “bro code” of guitarists.
