        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/derek-kravitz\">Derek Kravitz</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Will Parker</span>, <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/\">The Real Deal</a> </p>\n<p>President Donald Trump’s son Eric is preparing to capitalize on a windfall he received from his father during the presidential campaign: He’s combining three luxury Manhattan high-rise apartments, one of which he purchased at a throwaway price from his father, into one potentially lucrative penthouse.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2016, Eric Trump got a great deal from his father. He <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2017/07/05/heres-how-trump-transferred-wealth-to-his-son-while-avoiding-the-usual-taxes/\">bought two previously unsold condominium apartments at Trump Parc East for just $350,000 each</a>, about half of the price they had recently been listed for.  </p>\n<p>Such bargain basement sales are usually treated as gifts by the IRS. But they might not have been taxed that way, tax experts said, because of advantages available only to real estate developers.</p>\n<p>Last month, Eric transferred ownership of one of the condos — unit 14G — and two other adjacent apartments he owns into a new entity called 100 CPS Penthouse LLC.</p>\n<figure>\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4345702-Trump-Parc-East-Unit-14G-Transfer-to-100-CPS/annotations/397213.html\">View note</a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>He had already applied for permits to combine these three units into a 2,400-square-foot apartment on the top floor of a building that overlooks Manhattan’s Central Park. The estimated cost to combine the apartments: $410,000.</p>\n<figure>\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4345698-Construction-Permit-for-Tump-Parc-East/annotations/397204.html\">View note</a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>All told, Eric paid just under $3 million for the three apartments. With the estimated renovation costs included, he will have spent more than $3.3 million to create the penthouse.</p>\n<p>How much Eric could get on the market if he sold such a large penthouse is not clear, but for comparison’s sake, an apartment of 1,700 square feet on a lower floor of the same building sold for $7.5 million in 2013. At that price per foot, the penthouse would sell for over $10 million. Higher floors tend to command steeper prices.</p>\n<p>In 2008, a 4,400-square-foot unit in the building went on the market for $38 million but never sold.</p>\n<p>Representatives for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>David Herzig, a tax professor at Valparaiso University Law School, said the fact that Eric needed unit 14G in order to assemble the enlarged penthouse could make the fair market value of the gifted apartment even higher than previously thought.</p>\n<p>The $350,000 deal he got from Trump “might not only have been a fire sale,” he said, “but if this is a key component that you would need to combine them together to make a penthouse, to get the requisite number of rooms, that actually means that this property should have been sold at a premium, not a discount.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/201801100-eric-trump-condo-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/201801100-eric-trump-condo-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/201801100-eric-trump-condo-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/201801100-eric-trump-condo-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The Trump Parc East building in New York CIty\n<span>(Frank Franklin II/AP)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It’s not clear why Trump sold unit 14G to Eric for just $350,000, when he sold another unit, the 1,350-square-foot 14D, to Eric for $2 million in 2008. That was much closer to its likely market value.</p>\n<p>If he had simply given the apartment to Eric for free, Trump could have incurred up to 40 percent tax on its market price. But the sale for $350,000 could have been arranged to look like a “fair market sale” and not a gift.</p>\n<p>As the developer of the building, Trump had some leeway with how he priced unsold apartments. He could have demonstrated that the real value was very low if, for example, the apartment was still subject to city rent regulations or was in need of significant repairs. The apartment’s new function as the keystone for a penthouse, however, makes that a difficult case to argue, Herzig said.</p>\n<p>Trump paid transfer taxes on the sale, which isn’t the norm when gifting a property. But he also did not check a box on sales documents to indicate that the sale was between two relatives.</p>\n<p>The tax reform bill the president signed into law last month increased the amount of tax-free gifts individuals can hand down to their children from $5 million to $10 million. Without the president’s tax returns, we might never know if Trump reported the $350,000 sales to Eric as gifts.</p>\n<p>Trump was listed as Trump Parc East’s legal salesman until August of last year, eight months into his presidency, filings with the New York State Attorney General show. The president’s two oldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., are now in charge of selling the 14 remaining apartments in the building owned by the Trump Organization.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/8008932.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <span>Ray Long</span>, Chicago Tribune, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jason-grotto\">Jason Grotto</a>, ProPublica </p>\n<p>Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios is facing $41,000 in fines for failing to return campaign contributions from property tax appeals lawyers whose donations exceeded legal limits, according to a pair of new rulings by the county ethics board.</p>\n<p>The rulings raise the level of scrutiny on campaign contributions given by appeals lawyers to Berrios, who doubles as chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party and depends heavily on their donations in raising political funds. The action also ignites another high-profile showdown with the county Board of Ethics, with which he previously clashed over nepotism issues.</p>\n<p>At the center of the ethics board’s rulings is a 2016 county ordinance stating that donors who seek “official action” with the county may contribute no more than $750 in nonelection years. Attorneys for Berrios are seeking to overturn the rulings, arguing that the county limits are unconstitutional and that higher limits set by state law should apply, among other objections.</p>\n<p>The fines add to the controversy surrounding Berrios, who is heading into a March primary as he bids for a third four-year term as assessor.</p>\n<p>Berrios has been under fire for inaccurate assessments that favor the wealthy over the poor since the Tribune published “The Tax Divide,” an investigation launched in June and continued in December in collaboration with ProPublica Illinois. Federal court monitors also have criticized Berrios for being too slow to erase politics from hiring and other employment decisions as required under the anti-patronage Shakman decree.</p>\n<p>In rulings released late Monday, the ethics board listed 30 examples of property tax attorneys or firms whose donations to Berrios’ main political fund in late 2016 or early 2017 exceeded the $750 limit. It fined Berrios and the Committee to Elect Joseph Berrios Cook County Assessor $1,000 for each violation, for a total of $30,000. The $1,000 fine per violation is the maximum allowed.</p>\n<p>An additional $11,000 in fines were imposed on Berrios and his 31st Ward Democratic Organization, the source of his main power base.</p>\n<p>The ethics board said the 41 donations to Berrios’ political funds exceeded the limit by a total of $62,250 — an excess of $52,200 for the assessor’s election fund and $10,050 for the 31st Ward fund.</p>\n<p>Some contributions flagged by the ethics board came from the county’s most active tax appeal attorneys and firms.</p>\n<p>Among them was a $1,500 contribution made by Michael Crane of Crane and Norcross, which filed appeals on nearly $7.9 billion in commercial and industrial initial values since Berrios took office in December 2010, winning reductions on $1.8 billion, according to a ProPublica Illinois-Tribune analysis of county appeals data.</p>\n<p>Thomas Tully, a former Cook County assessor now with Thomas M. Tully &amp; Associates, contributed $5,000 to Berrios in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Tully law firm filed appeals on about $2.9 billion in commercial and industrial value since Berrios took office, winning reductions on $756 million.</p>\n<p>Crane and Tully did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The rulings, based on an October 2016 ordinance, appear to be the first to impose fines regarding campaign contributions from attorneys who represent clients before the assessor’s office.</p>\n<p>Attorney Kevin Forde, who said he was asked to represent Berrios as a special assistant state’s attorney, said Tuesday that the Berrios campaign funds had returned “over a dozen contributions” from the same time period as the ones now in dispute. Those donations generally came from county vendors, not lawyers representing clients before county government, he said.</p>\n<p>Arguing on Berrios’ behalf at a Monday board hearing, Forde challenged the authority of county officials to set contribution limits that are stricter than those permitted by state law. The state currently allows $5,600 in contributions from individuals per election.</p>\n<p>“There is a good-faith attempt by (Berrios) and the people who made the contributions to rely on state law and the validity and controlling authority of the state ethics statute,” Forde said.</p>\n<p>The ethics board rejected that argument, saying Cook County’s home-rule powers give the county authority to set its own limits. The questions of constitutionality and jurisdiction raised by Berrios are “impossible to square” with prior Illinois Supreme Court decisions, the board wrote in its rulings.</p>\n<p>Berrios’ campaign manager, Mario Lopez, echoed Forde’s legal objections, saying “every contribution received by the assessor’s campaign complies” with state law.</p>\n<p>“Attempts by the county ordinance to limit the rights of contributors are invalid,” Lopez said in a statement. “Assessor Berrios is not personally wealthy so he must rely on campaign contributions from supporters.”</p>\n<p>The issue is further complicated because Berrios challenger Fritz Kaegi has put enough of his own money into his campaign to remove the state’s contribution limits. To date, Kaegi has loaned himself $560,000, records show.</p>\n<p>“We intend to supply further evidence that there was no violation of the election law by accepting any contributions,” said Lopez, who predicted Berrios would prevail on a motion for the ethics board to reconsider its rulings.</p>\n<p>A memorandum prepared by Berrios’ team and given to the board Monday lays out numerous objections.</p>\n<p>To bolster the position that the county ordinance is invalid, the memo said the statewide contribution limits were put in place to “ensure people with an incentive to curry favor or buy influence with elected officials are prevented from doing so.”</p>\n<p>The memo also noted that a delegate to the state’s constitutional convention had argued that election laws “seem to fall entirely within the jurisdiction of the legislature rather than that of home rule units or their voters.”</p>\n<p>Even so, various home-rule communities, including the city of Chicago, have placed their own limits on campaign contributions from vendors with which they do business.</p>\n<p>Forde also argued that the county ethics ordinance would hinder the right of a citizen to retain the lawyer he or she wishes. “If an attorney made a campaign contribution in excess of the limits” set forth in the county ethics ordinance, “that attorney may have no choice but to decline to take a client’s property tax appeal,” the memo stated.</p>\n<p>The memo even challenges whether the county ordinance should apply to contributions from lawyers, saying the attorneys represent “individual taxpayers who are seeking to appeal a tax assessment.”</p>\n<p>“They serve as legal representatives of taxpayers who are seeking to enforce the constitutional rights of their clients to fair and uniform assessments,” the memorandum said.</p>\n<p>It’s not the first time Berrios will have challenged an ethics board decision. In 2012, the board fined Berrios $10,000 for violating county nepotism rules by hiring his sister and son to work in his office.</p>\n<p>After Berrios filed a legal challenge, a judge ruled in 2015 that the assessor had to comply with the county's ethics ordinance but that the ordinance did not authorize the board to impose fines. County commissioners later gave the board the power to levy fines. Berrios’ son no longer works in the assessor’s office.</p>\n<p>Cook County Commissioner Jesus “Chuy” Garcia commended the ethics board’s actions on contributions from tax appeals attorneys.</p>\n<p>“These contributions look bad,” he said. “They appear to the average person as pay-to-play activity.”</p>\n<p>Garcia, who is running for Congress, also pointed to the growing list of legal battles Berrios has fought with the ethics board and the county’s inspector general.</p>\n<p>“Joe Berrios always seems to be fighting our ethics agencies in Cook County, and it’s taxpayers who end up paying the expensive legal bills,” Garcia said.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/8008452.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/abrahm-lustgarten\">Abrahm Lustgarten</a> </p>\n<p>New research by Canadian scientists into the spread of a chemical commonly used in military explosives has confirmed some of the worst fears of U.S. environmental regulators tracking the threat posed by the Pentagon’s handling of its munitions in this country.</p>\n<p>The Canadian research analyzed soil and water samples at nine sites where military explosives were detonated between 1990 and 2014, and came up with data about where and in what concentrations the explosive compound known as RDX, a possible human carcinogen, had turned up. Calling RDX “an internationally known problem,” which “has led to an international warning on possible soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination on military training sites,” the research described with actual measurements how RDX floats on the wind and seeps through soils into water supplies.</p>\n<p>The researchers took water samples from groundwater at the explosives sites and found that in 26 out of 36 samples, the RDX that had made its way into aquifers exceeded levels considered safe. As a result, the researchers suggest that the data can be used to model RDX contamination at any site where munitions are routinely detonated, and for the first time, give environmental experts a way to quantify how much of it is spreading into surrounding communities.</p>\n<p>RDX was considered a major military breakthrough when it was first developed for large-scale use on the eve of World War II, and to this day it remains a staple of the U.S. military’s war-making abilities, used in bombs, missiles and other weapons. And for decades, the Pentagon has known about RDX’s potential health and environmental threat. But the Pentagon has long maintained that the risk is not great, and it has both financed research and flexed its political muscle to have its view prevail. Most recently, the Pentagon has waged an intense fight to not have the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency upgrade its classification of RDX’s health threat, a move that could expose the Department of Defense to billions of added dollars in cleanup costs.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, the Canadian research — published Nov. 17 in the Journal of Environmental Quality — will add to the store of knowledge about RDX contamination. The research found that while the highest concentrations of RDX remained in a ring around the sites where munitions had exploded, pieces of explosive, perhaps as large as a centimeter, were carried on the wind and later settled in the soil. Surface and groundwater samples showed that the RDX ultimately did not quickly dissolve or degrade as it sank deeper into the earth, where it usually was carried into water supplies.</p>\n<p>Harry Craig, one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s foremost experts on explosives contamination, has described RDX as the single greatest problem the U.S. faces when it comes to cleaning up thousands of toxic munitions sites across the country. In an email to agency colleagues, Craig described the Canadian research as both novel and useful.</p>\n<p>ProPublica <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bombs-in-our-backyard/military-pollution-rdx-bombs-holston-cornhusker/\">reported on</a> the history of RDX and the Department of Defense’s long-standing campaign to minimize its risks and fight EPA regulation in December. RDX has been discovered at dozens of U.S. defense sites, and increasingly in public drinking water supplies around them.  After early research by the U.S. Army determined that RDX was likely responsible for cancerous tumors in rats and mice, the Department of Defense has produced dozens of reports portraying RDX as more benign. </p>\n<p>The new report from Canadian scientists confirms some things that the Pentagon had long sought to deny: that RDX contamination was likely to be present in most places where munitions were exploded or detonated, and that once it was present in soil, RDX moved easily into water supplies. The Canadian findings suggest that RDX contamination on or around defense sites in the U.S. could be even more widespread than is already known.</p>\n<p>The Canadian report, authored by researchers at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre Eau, Terre et Environnement, and at Defence Research and Development Canada, both in Quebec, lists several U.S. sites with concentrations of RDX contamination that had not been previously disclosed in environmental data the Pentagon had provided to ProPublica. At Fort Hood, in Texas, RDX was present at dangerous levels. The same was true at Fort Greely in Alaska and Fort Bliss in New Mexico.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/8001355.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jennifer-valentino-devries\">Jennifer Valentino-DeVries</a> </p>\n<p>The largest advocacy group for older Americans and the two top members of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging are calling on employers and tech companies to stop limiting recruitment ads on Facebook and other online sites to younger workers.</p>\n<p>“It appears age discrimination is alive and well in the digital era,” Nancy LeaMond, executive vice president of AARP, said in a statement on Friday.</p>\n<p>“We urge online platforms to take the steps needed to ensure they’re not supporting age-biased recruiting and hiring practices. And we continue to call on all employers to end bias in their employment practices,” she said.</p>\n<p>Maine Republican Susan Collins, who chairs the Senate Aging Committee, and Pennsylvania Democrat Robert Casey, the ranking minority member, wrote to Facebook, Google and LinkedIn on Dec. 22, asking them how many employment ads on their platforms are targeted by age group, and what safeguards they have to prevent employment discrimination based on age. The companies have until the end of January to respond.</p>\n<p>“By targeting employment advertisements to specific age groups, certain users may be denied the ability to view job opportunities,” Collins and Casey wrote. “While targeted online job postings can benefit both employers and workers, this technological advancement can also become an avenue for discriminatory practices if not properly managed.”</p>\n<p>AARP and the senators were reacting to a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-ads-age-discrimination-targeting\">Dec. 20 report</a> by ProPublica and The New York Times that dozens of the nation’s leading employers, including Facebook itself, narrow their audience for job ads on Facebook and other platforms by age. The ability of advertisers to direct their messages at specific groups is a cornerstone of Facebook’s business. But such micro-targeting becomes controversial when it fosters discrimination in legally protected categories such as race and age. ProPublica has reported that Facebook also accepted ads aimed at <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\">“Jew-haters”</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin\">housing ads</a> that discriminated by race, gender, disability and other factors.</p>\n<p>On the same day that the employment-ad article was published, a class-action complaint alleging age discrimination was filed in federal court in San Francisco against major employers for denying job opportunities to older workers by preventing them from receiving recruiting ads on Facebook. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Communications Workers of America and its members, as well as all Facebook users 40 or older.</p>\n<p>ProPublica found that Google and LinkedIn also allowed the purchase of employment ads targeted by age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its ad-buying portal to prevent advertisers from using age ranges unless they affirm the ad is not discriminatory. Google and Facebook acknowledged that they allow advertisers to display ads based on the user’s age, and defended the practice.</p>\n<p>“Used responsibly, age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted industry practice and for good reason: it helps employers recruit and people of all ages find work,” said Rob Goldman, a Facebook vice president. A Facebook spokesman said the company is in touch with the AARP and the Senate Aging Committee.</p>\n<p>The AARP, which has more than 35 million members, and the senators also said the widespread targeting of ads to younger workers online shows the need to update the 1967 law that prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment.</p>\n<p>“Technological advancements require new attention,” LeaMond said. “The methods of discrimination have changed and its tools now include algorithms, dropdown boxes and pattern recognition.”</p>\n<p>Casey has proposed legislation to strengthen the age discrimination law by making it equivalent to statutory protections based on race and gender. He said the issue of age targeting in online employment ads is new to him.</p>\n<p>“We still have to learn a lot more,” he said in an interview. “One of the problems is the awareness of the law and the intensity with regard to how employers approach compliance on age discrimination is at a very low level” compared with other forms of bias.</p>\n<p>Other groups besides AARP also expressed concern in response to the article. “This kind of discriminatory redlining is just the tip of the iceberg, and it must stop,” Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit that seeks to strengthen protections for workers, said in a Dec. 21 statement.</p>\n<p>“To hear that certain employers might not make job ads visible to those people, it’s disheartening,” Maura Porcelli, managing director of the Senior Community Service Employment Program at the National Council on Aging, said in an interview. “The data shows that older adults are valuable members of the workplace, with expertise and very low turnover. But clearly some employers have still not embraced that value.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7988550.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\npor <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/paul-kiel\">Paul Kiel</a> </p>\n<p>El edificio en forma de caja donde está ubicada la empresa JC Foreclosures Service no parece gran cosa. Si usted va en auto, tal vez pasará por alto esta empresa que realiza el servicio de ejecución de hipotecas entre las gasolineras y talleres de carrocería en el suburbio hispano de Bell, zona de clase trabajadora al sur del condado de Los Ángeles. La única cosa que puede captar su atención es la frase en letras rojas brillantes sobre la ventana, escrita en español: “MODIFICAMOS SU PRESTAMO. DESALOJOS. BANCARROTAS”.</p>\n<p>Pero en el interior es donde sucede la ‘magia’. El dueño del negocio, Carlos Baez, es un maestro de algo que es todo un arte en Los Ángeles: utilizar la herramienta de la bancarrota para obtener ganancias. Cuando sus clientes llegan a verlo, desesperados por la posibilidad de ser desalojados, él puede prometer ayudarlos — siempre y cuando le sigan pagando — utilizando el poder de las reglas de la bancarrota para frenar un juicio hipotecario. Baez no es abogado y los archivos muestran que los cientos de casos que ha presentado frecuentemente están mal preparados y son rechazados por las cortes a los pocos meses. Pero el punto no es lograr un alivio duradero a la deuda de sus clientes. La meta es ganar tiempo, algo que logra repetidamente.</p>\n<p>Por supuesto, hay leyes para evitar tal abuso del sistema. Si alguien presenta un caso una y otra vez, las protecciones de bancarrota pueden ser revocadas. Pero Baez tiene otra técnica que suele usar. Sobre el papel, sus clientes aparecen transferiendo el derecho de propiedad de sus vivendas a un grupo de personas que reciben un 5% cada uno. Este un truco permite convertir pasar de un único propietario a cuatro, cada uno de los cuales puede declararse en quiebra, uno tras otro. No importa si estos nuevos propietarios son reales. Para cuando llega el momento en que una persona de carne y hueso debe de presentarse en una audiencia, han pasado uno o dos meses. Entonces el caso es desestimado y un nuevo propietario se presenta. Y el proceso vuelve a comenzar.</p>\n<p>Con engaños de este estilo, se pueden detener los juicios hipotecarios durante meses y a veces años. Es el tipo de fraude abierto que uno esperaría que podía ser rápidamente detectado y castigado. Pero esto es Los Ángeles, donde Baez no es un innovador extraordinario, sino un miembro más en una industria local que ha existido durante décadas. Lleva más de diez años en el tema. Es difícil llevar la cuenta de todas las leyes de quiebra que ha transgredido y, de acuerdo a sus respuestas a mis preguntas, no tiene planeado detenerse en el futuro cercano. Dice que está ayudando a sus clientes y que para eso existe la bancarrota.</p>\n<p>Fui a Los Ángeles porque los datos nacionales mostraban que algo singular estaba pasando allí. Ningún otro distrito en el país ha tenido ni de cerca un número tan grande de casos presentados sin un abogado como la Corte de Bancarrotas de Estados Unidos para el Distrito Central de California. Esto es una señal de advertencia, porque los deudores generalmente terminan mucho peor cuando no tienen representación legal. Indagando más profundamente, nuestro análisis descubrió miles de casos presentados cada año que tenían los indicios clásicos de fraude.</p>\n<p>Además, resultó que esto es un secreto a voces no solo entre jueces y administradores de tribunales en el distrito, sino también entre expertos en bancarrota en todo el país. Incluso el Congreso ha aprobado en dos ocasiones leyes para combatir los ardides relacionados con quiebras que emanan de Los Ángeles.</p>\n<p>Esto explica la frustración de la juez Maureen Tighe, quien preside en la sala del distrito y ha intentado llamar la atención sobre la escala de estos fraudes. Una exfiscal, Tighe orienta a los empleados de la corte para que estén atentos a gente sospechosa, intenta castigar a aquellos que violan la ley y ayuda a publicar reportes sobre las dimensiones del fraude potencial. Incluso ha convocado audiencias especiales al respecto. Pero hasta ahí llega lo que puede hacer. Mientras tanto, los brazos del sistema judicial con el deber de vigilar estos crímenes — el fiscal general del estado y el Departamento Federal de Investigación (FBI) — raramente actúan al respecto.</p>\n<p>“¿Si nadie obedece la ley y si no hay mecanismos para exigir su cumplimiento ni recursos policiales, qué valor tiene la ley?”, preguntó Tighe.</p>\n<p>El éxito de estas artimañas refleja un hecho básico del sistema de bancarrota. Para gente que tiene la sofisticación y los recursos para contratar abogados acreditados, la bancarrota funciona bien. Para los otros, existen las trampas.</p>\n<p>ProPublica ha estado examinando los problemas profundamente arraigados en el sistema de bancarrota del país utilizando un innovador método de análisis de casos. A través del país, hemos hallado cómo los costos de declararse en quiebra dañan a quienes el sistema de bancarrota debería servir. El año pasado, reportamos que los estadounidenses de raza negra en el Sur son mucho menos propensos a conseguir alivio duradero de sus deudas por bancarrota, debido a las altas tarifas que los abogados exigen, las que los obligan aescoger planes de pago para cubrir una posible quiebra que probablemente no podrán cumplir.</p>\n<p>En Los Ángeles descubrimos que lo más probable es que la gente vulnerable y con deudas, particularmente minorías e inmigrantes, intenten navegar el sistema sin ningún abogado. Muchos de ellos recurren a personas como Báez, preparadores de peticiones de bancarrota sin licencia, quienes muchas veces operan más allá de lo que permite la ley y esconden su participación cuando tramitan los casos.</p>\n<p>Distritos judiciales en otras partes del país con altas cifras de casos tramitados por los mismos afectados — lugares como Atlanta, Detroit y Milwaukee — tienen problemas similares de fraude. En particular, lo que aquí sucede es que existen preparadores de solicitudes sin escrúpulos quienes burlan las leyes y cobran demasiado por sus servicios.</p>\n<p>“Hay tanta gente que necesita el apoyo que da el sistema para quiebras y que no pueden pagarlo,” dijo Tighe. “Y entonces caen víctimas de estos estafadores. Si tuviéramos acceso adecuado [para todos] a nuestro sistema legal, estas personas no caerían presos de la cosecha de estos artistas del fraude”.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg\">\n<figcaption>La jueza Maureen Tighe, exfiscal federal, ha intentado llamar la atención sobre el fraude en la Corte de Bancarrotas de Estados Unidos del Distrito Central de California, donde ha sido jueza desde 2003.\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A pesar de estas tendencias negativas, tanto en el sur de Estados Unidos como en Los Ángeles, hallamos una arraigada falta de voluntad para detener las estafas.</p>\n<p>Sin mucha vigilancia penal de las leyes, la cantidad de fraudes en el Distrito Central de California sube y baja con la economía. Durante la crisis hipotecaria en 2011, cuando los 126,000 casos presentados por quiebra de consumidores en el distrito fueron casi un 10% de todos los casos en el país, la cantidad de fraudes de este tipo llegó a su punto máximo. Hoy, en una región donde tanta gente lucha para poder costear su vivienda, muchos estafadores todavía siguen operando.</p>\n<p>El Programa Fiduciario de Estados Unidos, agencia que supervisa la corte de bancarrota, refiere cientos de crímenes potenciales a la oficina local del fiscal federal cada año. En la mayoría de los años, solo entre uno y tres casos acaban en denuncias penales, según datos obtenidos por ProPublica a través de una solicitud bajo el Acta de Libertad de Información. En 2009, ni una sola de las 266 recomendaciones para acción penal hechas por la oficina del Programa Fiduciario produjo una denuncia por los fiscales en el distrito.</p>\n<p>“Hay mucha frustración, creo, entre algunos miembros del Programa Fiduciario que sienten que están haciendo el máximo esfuerzo para intentar hacer algo contra este tipo de crimen financiero,” dijo Jennifer Braun, quien trabajó como abogada en la oficina de distrito de este programa hasta principios del año pasado.</p>\n<p>Los fiscales federales mencionan la falta de recursos y la necesidad de perseguir crímenes de perfil más alto como las razones por las que existen pocas denuncias en casos de quiebra. Desentrañar estas complejas argucias requiere mucho trabajo para victorias de poco calibre, dijeron.</p>\n<p>Como resultado, especialmente en los barrios predominantemente de hispanos e inmigrantes dentro y alrededor de Los Ángeles, no es difícil encontrar ejemplos de estas artimañas. Solo tuve que mirar un poco.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Encontré la empresa Liderazgo Financiero solo a un par de millas de JC Foreclosure. “NO PIERDA SU CASA” decía el letrero impreso que colgaba encima de una ventana con barrotes. Dentro del negocio, encima de un escritorio, montones de panfletos de publicidad de color verde cubiertos de advertencias urgentes en español sobre juicios hipotecarios estaban listos para ser enviados por correo.</p>\n<p>“La única forma de evitar un juicio hipotecario es a través de una quiebra”, me dijo Santiago Núñez cuando visité su pequeña oficina en South Gate en junio. “Tienes que hacer un Capítulo 13”.</p>\n<p>Es cierto que el Capítulo 13 es la mejor opción bajo el código de quiebra para alguien que se enfrenta a un juicio hipotecario. Teóricamente, los propietarios en apuros pueden ponerse al día con su deuda por hipoteca a través de un plan de pagos, que suele durar cinco años y está calibrado conforme a los ingresos del afectado.</p>\n<p>Pero aun cuando los deudores presentan su caso con un abogado, el Capítulo 13 tiene sus riesgos. Sin un abogado, es casi imposible obtener sus beneficios sin problemas. Entre 2008 y 2014, casi la mitad de las bancarrotas presentadas por Capítulo 13 en el Distrito Central de California se hicieron sin abogado (conocidos en la jerga legal de EEUU como casos <em>pro se</em>). Alrededor de un 85% de estos casos quedaron incompletos porque en los tramites faltaba información financiera básica de los deudores, según el análisis de ProPublica. Casi todos los casos fueron desechados en pocos meses, forzando a los deudores a volver a empezar sin ningún alivio a sus deudas.</p>\n<p>Cuando revisé 50 casos <em>pro se</em> tramitados por Capitulo 13 en zonas mayoritariamente hispanas donde son más comunes las quiebras sin representación de un abogado, determiné que dos tercios de los deudores terminaron perdiendo sus viviendas, normalmente a menos de un año de haber presentado el caso.</p>\n<p>Ni Núñez ni su mujer, Verónica, propietaria de la compañía, son abogados. Saltando de inglés al español, Núñez describió afablemente los servicios que Liderazgo Financiero ofrece a clientes desesperados por salvar sus hogares. Los abogados locales de quiebra, dijo, pueden cobrar hasta 5,000 dólares para tramitar un caso bajo Capítulo 13, pero su empresa solo cobra 200 dólares. Es cierto que las tarifas de abogados para Capítulo 13 en Los Ángeles oscilan entre 4,000 y 5,000 dólares, pero muchos abogados aceptan una porción de esa cantidad como anticipo, con el restante a pagar a través del plan. Para la gran frustración de jueces y abogados en el distrito, empresas como Liderazgo Financiero suelen atraer a los clientes con promesas de un rescate barato, pero después terminan extrayendo tarifas parecidas a las que cobran los abogados.</p>\n<p>Cuando le pregunté a Núñez acerca de sus tarifas, reconoció que los 200 dólares solo cubren el documento más básico: la solicitud de quiebra. Para presentar toda la información necesaria sobre los ingresos, deudas y activos del deudor, la empresa cobraba 1,500 dólares, según dijo.</p>\n<p>Esto es ilegal. Se permite a los no-abogados ayudar a alguien con un caso de quiebra, pero si aceptan pago, sus actividades están estrictamente limitadas. Se exige que revelen su involucramiento y no pueden dar consejos legales. En Los Ángeles, cualquiera puede establecerse como preparador de solicitudes, pero lo máximo que pueden cobrar por rellenar los formularios es 200 dólares.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg\">\n<figcaption>La oficina de Liderazgo Financiero en South Gate, California. Los propietarios no son abogados, pero han tramitado cientos de quiebras, muchas veces violando la ley.\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Un preparador de solicitudes con quien hablé dijo que es imposible hacer el trabajo bien y también cumplir con la ley. “No puedes ser un preparador y no dar consejos legales, porque si un cliente tiene una pregunta [sobre la quiebra] y usted responde a la pregunta, entonces les está dando un consejo legal,” dijo Christian Yates, asistente legal. Después de ser multado por Tighe en 2012 por violar las leyes de tramitación de casos, Yates dijo que ahora solo ayuda con las quiebras con un abogado presente, lo que sí es permitido. Pero otros preparadores “van a seguir haciéndolo hasta que sean pillados,” dijo.</p>\n<p>Los preparadores de solicitudes son más activos en los barrios hispanos del distrito, pero están en todas partes, prometiendo ayudar tanto con el Capítulo 13 como con el Capítulo 7, que típicamente elimina las deudas en un par de meses. Un deudor que conocí en una audiencia de la corte, y quien pidió que no se usara su nombre, me dijo que encontró un preparador sencillamente poniendo “paralegal’’ (asistente de abogado) en Google y que había pagado 750 dólares. Se prohíbe a los preparadores usar la palabra “legal” u otras similares al publicitar sus servicios, pero muchos sencillamente ignoran esta restricción.</p>\n<p>Según archivos judiciales, Araneta Legal Services, que hasta recientemente operaba el sitio web losangelesparalegal.org, no había revelado que había rellenado la solicitud del deudor. Los preparadores pueden esquivar la atención de la corte por el sencillo método de no revelar su participación en un caso, otra violación de la ley. Joseph Araneta, dueño de la empresa, no respondió a mis llamadas y correos electrónicos. Al parecer, la empresa ha dejado de funcionar.</p>\n<p>En lo que concierne a Liderazgo Financiero, los archivos demuestran que ha estado involucrada en más de 200 quiebras desde mitades de 2012. En al menos 56 de ellas, la empresa no reveló su involucramiento.</p>\n<p>Yo pude conectar estos casos a la empresa porque datos de la corte identificaban a Verónica Núñez como la persona que los había llevado a los tribunales. Como una medida para combatir que los preparadores eludan los requerimientos de información, los cinco tribunales en el distrito han empezado a exigir a los no-abogados mostrar su identificación cuando presentan en persona casos de quiebra para sus clientes. La corte compartió estos datos con ProPublica. Pero hasta esta cifra es incompleta porque Santiago Núñez me dijo que la empresa generalmente exige a los clientes que presenten sus casos ellos mismos. Esta es otra manera en que los preparadores evaden el escrutinio judicial.</p>\n<p>Algunas de las bancarrotas manejadas por Liderazgo Financiero que examiné eran claramente falsas. En una estratagema que duró entre 2009 y 2015, 18 deudores diferentes dieron la misma dirección en Compton como su hogar en sus solicitudes de quiebra, pero solo uno de ellos vivía realmente en la casa de 1,100 pies cuadrados, según archivos públicos.</p>\n<p>Verónica Núñez llevó ocho de estas quiebras de Compton a los tribunales, según indican los datos de la corte. Una novena quiebra fue presentada bajo el nombre de Juan Azuaje, un hombre que había contratado a Liderazgo Financiero para evitar un juicio hipotecario sobre su casa que estaba a una distancia de 50 millas en Simi Valley, según una grabación de la audiencia en la corte en 2012. Los archivos de la corte muestran que él, o alguien que usaba su nombre, presentó dos solicitudes de quiebra separadas en el mismo día: una dando la dirección de Simi Valley como su casa, la otra dando la dirección de Compton. Los archivos públicos muestran que Azuaje no tuvo ningún vínculo a la casa de Compton, que finalmente llegó a juicio hipotecario. Azuaje y el antiguo dueño de la propiedad de Compton no pudieron ser localizados para dar sus comentarios.</p>\n<p>Las frecuentes presentaciones de solicitudes por parte de Liderazgo Financiero no han pasado totalmente desapercibidas en la corte. En enero de 2012, un juez en el distrito emitió una orden para que Santiago Núñez apareciera y se enfrentara a posibles multas por tramitar un caso de forma incorrecta. Este no se presentó en corte, algo común, según Tighe. “Tengo cientos de órdenes que están siendo ignoradas.”</p>\n<p>Núñez no respondió a una detallada lista de preguntas que le hice en relación a varias violaciones de la ley.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>En el verano de 2012, Mohsen Saeedy estaba desesperado. El hombre, un inmigrante iraní de alrededor de cincuenta años, había construido su propio negocio de imprenta de fotos en Los Ángeles y puesto sus ahorros en una casa tipo rancho en Phoenix, Arizona, donde él y su mujer planeaban jubilarse. La hipoteca de interés y tasa modificable le había parecido asequible en 2007. Cinco años después, ya no lo era.</p>\n<p>Entonces encontró a JC Foreclosure. Según el recuerdo de Saeedy, la empresa prometió forzar al banco a modificar su préstamo y bajar el préstamo principal a lo que realmente valía la casa. En su estado de desesperación, dijo Saeedy, esas promesas eran irresistibles. Pagó 1,000 dólares a un intermediario para que le conectara con JC Foreclosure. Después dio a la empresa \\$1,600 para empezar, y aceptó pagar \\$600 en efectivo cada mes.</p>\n<p>Por supuesto, JC Foreclosure no tenía ningún poder especial para convencer a los bancos de hacer lo que ellos querían. Sin embargo, tenía muchos trucos. Poco después, la empresa ejecutó una transferencia de título de propiedad de la esposa de Saeedy, quien poseía el título de la casa de Arizona, a una mujer llamada Marian García. Más tarde, un segundo y un tercer título de propiedad sirvieron para transferir intereses en la casa a cuatro individuos más. Saeedy me dijo que no sabía quién era García o las demás personas, y su mujer dijo que nunca había firmado tales títulos de propiedad.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Las ventanas frontales de JC Foreclosure Service\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>En este tipo de arreglos, el poder de protección del Capitulo 13 puede ser desplegado repetidamente para la misma casa siempre y cuando cada deudor parezca tener derecho a reclamar las protecciones brindadas por una bancarrota.</p>\n<p>“[Es] la orden de suspensión cautelar más barata que se puede conseguir,” dijo Tighe.</p>\n<p>No queda claro si algunas de esas personas sabían que habían adquirido acciones en una casa en Arizona. Un par de ellas no parecen ser reales. Pero un nuevo propietario involuntario de una porción de la propiedad de Saeedy es sin duda una persona real. De hecho, ya había presentado su propia solicitud de quiebra independiente. Después de tramitarla solo, había contratado a un abogado. Sin saberlo, unos estafadores le habían transferido acciones de al menos 11 propiedades, entre ellas la casa de Saeedy, según mociones registradas en su caso.</p>\n<p>Abogados, jueces y fiscales llaman esta técnica de fraude ‘secuestro’. Los estafadores seleccionan una quiebra recién presentada — realmente no importa cual — y después fingen que el deudor de aquel caso es el dueño de las propiedades que los estafadores quieren proteger. Es un ardid ingenioso que frena el juicio hipotecario y ahorra el gasto de una tarifa de tramitación de solicitud.</p>\n<p>Este tipo de ‘secuestros’ crean dolores de cabeza para abogados y jueces y exponen a deudores legítimos al peligro de efectos adversos. Renay Rodriguez, abogada en Los Ángeles, lidió con un caso en el cual porciones de 13 propiedades diferentes fueron transferidas a sus clientes. “Era absolutamente desconcertante intentar explicárselo,” dijo.</p>\n<p>Las otras cuatro personas que recibieron acciones en la casa de Saeedy todas solicitaron quiebras <em>pro se</em>. Una parece ser una persona verdadera que, con la ayuda de otro preparador, presentó nueve solicitudes de quiebra durante seis años. Finalmente un juez le prohibió presentar otras solicitudes. Otra persona declaró que su vivienda era la dirección empresarial de JC Foreclosure.</p>\n<p>Cuando en verano visité la pequeña oficina de la empresa, estaba vacía exceptuando una mujer en la mesa de recepción. Ella me dijo que la empresa no tramitaba solicitudes de quiebra porque Baez, el dueño, no era abogado. En vez de esto, dijo, la compañía derivaba a los clientes a un bufete legal cuando la bancarrota parecía la opción apropiada. No se acordaba del nombre del bufete.</p>\n<p>En el mostrador enfrente de su escritorio – al lado de una pila de panfletos de publicidad postal marcados URGENTE, con las direcciones escritas y listos para ser enviados a clientes potenciales – había formularios de quiebra, rellenados para una deudora de nombre Suyay Crow, pero todavía sin tramitar.</p>\n<p>Más tarde, cuando averigüé en archivos públicos, parecía que nadie con este nombre jamás había vivido en la casa del sur de Los Ángeles que estaba listada en la solicitud de quiebra. Era en realidad la segunda vez que Crow había presentado una solicitud de quiebra desde aquella dirección, cada vez sin abogado. Crow, quien puede existir o no, había adquirido acciones en la propiedad a través de un título de propiedad realizado el pasado marzo.</p>\n<p>Al día siguiente, visité la casa en el sur de Los Ángeles. Cuatro vehículos estaban estacionados enfrente de la casa y unos niños jugaban en el jardín. Un montón de basura, incluyendo una vieja pecera y neumáticos, ocupaban el porche de la entrada. La dueña, una señora de raza negra de 86 años, abrió la puerta en silla de ruedas. Dijo que vivía allí con su sobrina, su hijo y las dos hijas de este, y que había sido la propietaria de la casa por 20 años.</p>\n<p>La mujer, quien pidió que no se usara su nombre, me dijo que no sabía nada de Crow, Baez o JC Foreclosure. Estaba en peligro de un juicio hipotecario, dijo, porque habían subido las tarifas de pago de un préstamo. Usando otro preparador local, ella había tramitado dos solicitudes de quiebra bajo su nombre en años recientes. Las dos veces, los casos habían sido rápidamente desechados. Pero dijo que no sabía nada de los otros casos presentados y que nunca había firmado un título transfiriendo acciones de la propiedad.</p>\n<p>“No tengo nada que ver con esto, absolutamente nada,” me dijo. Los archivos públicos muestran que el prestamista fue a juicio hipotecario por la casa en octubre.</p>\n<p>Desde 2012, Baez ha llevado al menos 237 casos de quiebra a los tribunales. Solo en 10 casos un preparador fue identificado. Como con Liderazgo Financiero, la cifra probablemente solo refleja una parte de la actividad de la empresa, especialmente porque JC Foreclosure ha estado funcionando desde 2005, mucho antes de que la corte empezara a hacer seguimiento de tramitadores sospechosos.</p>\n<p>Parece que la empresa sistemáticamente cobra a sus clientes tarifas que exceden considerablemente el monto legalmente permitido de 200 dólares por sus servicios, como hizo con Saeedy. Un contrato de 2016 que me fue mostrado indica que la empresa cobró 1,200 dólares para tramitar una bancarrota de Capitulo 13.</p>\n<p>Los ciclos de quiebras falsas pueden evitar el juicio hipotecario durante años, pero a veces los servicios de hipoteca finalmente descubren la trama y presentan un recurso para frenarla. Respondiendo a una cadena de siete solicitudes que parecen haber sido organizados por Baez (los datos de la corte muestran que personalmente llevó al menos dos de los casos a los tribunales), un abogado para una empresa de hipotecas declaró en una moción en 2013 “el abuso de las leyes de bancarrota debe ser frenado. Ya basta”.</p>\n<p>La empresa hipotecaria finalmente se percató del el caso de Saeedy también, y consiguió una orden prohibiendo que cualquier futura quiebra impidiera un juicio hipotecario sobre la propiedad. Durante más de un año, Saeedy pagó a la empresa de Baez con la expectativa de recibir una modificación de su préstamo, de acuerdo a lo que me explicó. Entonces fue abruptamente informado por Baez de que la empresa no podía hacer más para ayudarle. El juicio hipotecario era inminente. Invadido de nuevo por el pánico, Saeedy solicitó la quiebra por su cuenta para frenar la venta y rápidamente contrató un abogado.</p>\n<p>Solo entonces, dijo, se enteró de las quiebras fraudulentas. Su abogado explicó que por culpa de ellas, su propia solicitud de quiebra no había impedido el juicio hipotecario.</p>\n<p>Casi cuatro años después, Saeedy todavía está recuperándose. Finalmente decidió dejar el caso de bancarrota porque no veía que valiera la pena. Lamenta no haber presentado una solicitud antes. “Hubiera tenido un resultado muy diferente”, dijo.</p>\n<p>Como muchas víctimas de estafas, Saeedy no puso una denuncia ni fue a las autoridades. En vez de eso, dijo, ha estado “negando la realidad” de los miles de dólares que había malgastado. “No quería pensar en lo estúpido que había sido”.</p>\n<p>Envié preguntas a Baez, exponiendo las pruebas de cómo su empresa había violado las leyes de quiebra cientos de veces. También detallé cuatro tramas de transferencia de título de propiedad además de los casos que se explican en este reportaje.</p>\n<p>En una respuesta escrita, Baez no negó ni reconoció haber falsificado documentos o presentado solicitudes de quiebra en nombre de gente ficticia. Se negó a hablar de ningún caso particular, diciendo que para hacer eso necesitaba un permiso firmado del cliente.</p>\n<p>En su lugar, aseveró que, como su empresa tramitaba quiebras para beneficiar a clientes, las tramitaciones de solicitudes no habían sido fraudulentas, porque las leyes de quiebra “están allí para proteger a deudores”. También dijo que yo me había equivocado en decir que él había trabajado como preparador de solicitudes porque la mayoría de sus clientes “no vienen a nosotros solo para presentar un caso de bancarrota”. Cobra más de 200 dólares a los clientes, dijo, porque la empresa pasa mucho tiempo trabajando con ello. “Es una práctica común entre muchos proveedores de servicios ayudar a sus clientes a presentar una solicitud de Capitulo 13 si se necesita más tiempo para negociar con los prestamistas,” añadió.</p>\n<p>No hay excepción en la ley que permita a los negocios cobrar más de 200 dólares si otorgan otros servicios además de preparar los casos de quiebra.</p>\n<p>Baez dijo que su oficina provee rutinariamente a sus clientes “el servicio” de llevar sus casos de bancarrota a la corte y pagar las tarifas de la tramitación de solicitud. Esto es una violación de la ley.</p>\n<p>Pero dijo que mis preguntas habían causado “una revisión cuidadosa de nuestras prácticas empresariales”. En adelante, JC Foreclosure va a exigir que los clientes presenten sus propios casos de quiebra, dijo.</p>\n<p>En un indicio de los desafíos que enfrenta la corte, este cambio prometido simplemente hará más difícil rastrear las actividades de la compañía.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Las denuncias penales por fraude de bancarrota no siempre fueron tan infrecuentes como son ahora. En 1988, cuando Tighe empezó su carrera como fiscal en Los Ángeles, su única responsabilidad era combatir este tipo de fraude. Ya entonces, el área exigía atención a raíz del número extremadamente alto de casos presentados por deudores sin abogados y la proliferación de preparadores de solicitudes.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Tighe preguntó, “Si nadie obedece la ley, y si no hay mecanismos para exigir su cumplimiento ni recursos policiales, qué valor tiene la ley?”\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“Puse a muchos de ellos en la cárcel”, dijo Tighe acerca de los primeros innovadores de fraude en el distrito. Durante los noventa, las denuncias penales por quiebras continuaron siendo una prioridad. En 1996, la entonces fiscal general Janet Reno lanzó una campaña nacional llamada ‘Operación Transparencia Total’, enfocada en el problema.</p>\n<p>Pero las estadísticas nacionales revelan que estas denuncias penales empezaron a escasear después de 2001. Llegado 2011, el número de denuncias federales en las cuales el cargo principal era un crimen relacionado a una quiebra había caído a menos de la mitad, según datos compilados por la Oficina de Compensación de Acceso a Archivos Transaccionales.</p>\n<p>Esta caída ocurrió a pesar de algunas advertencias internas. En el FBI, una evaluación de inteligencia de 2010 que ha sido hecho pública subsecuentemente concluyó que las quiebras fraudulentas, especialmente aquellas utilizadas para congelar juicios hipotecarios, iban a tener “un impacto significativo sobre las industrias estadounidenses de hipotecas, banca y bonos; en los consumidores; y en la economía de Estados Unidos en general”.</p>\n<p>Las tramas afectan a bancos, inversionistas y barrios porque dilatan juicios hipotecarios inevitables. También causan juicios hipotecarios innecesarios porque atrapan a propietarios en apuros que podrían haber logrado mantener posesión de sus casas a través de medios legítimos.</p>\n<p>A pesar del informe de inteligencia, no hay indicios de que se reasignaran recursos al respecto. En entrevistas, antiguos fiscales federales dijeron que recortes de presupuesto han defenestrado su capacidad para llevar adelante denuncias de este tipo.</p>\n<p>Evan Davis, un exfiscal federal en Los Ángeles, recordó su frustración cuando era su trabajo coordinar las denuncias federales por quiebras en el distrito durante la crisis hipotecaria, y la oficina local del Fiduciario federal le mandaba una serie seguida de posibles crímenes para investigar.</p>\n<p>“Mi caja de correos se atascaba con referencias que no tenía ningún interés en leer, porque sabía que no irían a ninguna parte”, dijo. “Estábamos allí sentados lamentando el hecho de que no podríamos hacer más por esos casos”.</p>\n<p>Robert Dugdale, un fiscal federal adjunto que fue jefe de la división criminal en Los Ángeles de 2010 a 2015, dijo que hubo “una congelación de contrataciones en nuestra oficina durante varios años, así que todos los que se iban no podían ser reemplazados”. Llegó un momento, dijo, en que el dinero era tan escaso que solo mandar un paquete por Fedex requería un memorándum justificando el gasto.</p>\n<p>Las limitaciones eran aún peores en el FBI, de acuerdo diversas fuentes. Después de los atentados del 11 de Septiembre, el terrorismo doméstico se convirtió en un enfoque mayor para el FBI y otras fuerzas de seguridad, sacando recursos del área de denuncias de crimen financiero. Por encima, a los agentes del FBI “en efecto se les disuadía de investigar los casos [de quiebra],” dijo Davis, porque el fraude de bancarrota es clasificado en el nivel menor de crímenes financieros.</p>\n<p>El Programa Fiduciario federal también ha sido exprimido por recortes de presupuesto. En un testimonio reciente al Congreso, el director del programa se jactó de su “diligente administración de recursos cada vez más escasos,” dado que su personal ha sido reducido en un 14% durante los últimos diez años.</p>\n<p>Los abogados del Programa Fiduciario federal pueden hacer denuncias civiles como respuesta a transgresiones, pero no cargos criminales. Para esto, remiten los casos a otras agencias. Los fiscales estatales y locales pueden hacer denuncias a veces, pero solo si también se han violado leyes locales como parte de la trama.</p>\n<p>En una declaración oficial a ProPublica, el Departamento de Justicia resaltó las actividades del Programa Fiduciario federal para identificar crímenes en quiebras y entrenar a otros para identificarlos: “Con el paso del tiempo, estos esfuerzos colectivos dentro del Departamento de Justicia y con la comunidad más amplia de bancarrota pueden resultar no solo en un aumento en remisiones y denuncias penales, sino también en una mayor disuasión de crímenes por quiebras desde el inicio”. La declaración no explicó cómo este aumento en denuncias penales “podría” ocurrir.</p>\n<p>La falta de recursos disponibles para denuncias vinculadas a las quiebras no está limitada a Los Ángeles. En Milwaukee, hace tiempo que los jueces de bancarrotas están preocupados por la conducta de los preparadores de solicitudes.</p>\n<p>“Es algo trágico porque la gente que está siendo victimizada por esto son los más vulnerables,” dijo la jueza Susan Kelley, jefa de los jueces de quiebras en el Distrito Este de Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>Cada abril, después de que han pasado los meses más duros del invierno del Medio Oeste, la compañía de energía de Milwaukee termina su suspensión invernal de cortar servicios de gas o electricidad por causa de falta de pagos. Amenazados con perder los servicios, muchos residentes responden presentando solicitudes de quiebra, frecuentemente con la ayuda de preparadores, de acuerdo a Kelley.</p>\n<p>La gran mayoría de esos deudores tienen bajos ingresos y son de raza negra. Según el análisis hecho por ProPublica de los casos presentados en el distrito desde 2013 hasta finales de 2015, casi la mitad de los casos de Capítulo 7 tramitados por deudores en zonas de mayoría negra fueron hechos sin abogado. En las zonas de mayoría blanca, solo un 5% de los casos fueron presentados <em>pro se</em>.</p>\n<p>Frenar a estos preparadores algunas veces ha resultado estar fuera del alcance de los poderes de la corte. En un ejemplo, los jueces mandaron dos veces a alguaciles federales para forzar a una preparadora a presentarse en corte y explicar por qué había ignorado las órdenes de la corte y las multas. Cuando ni esta medida la detuvo, la corte intentó abrir un procedimiento criminal.</p>\n<p>La oficina del fiscal federal se abstuvo de hacer la denuncia, sin embargo, porque “haberlo hecho no sería un uso prudente de recursos de la justicia”, según una orden de una corte de distrito.</p>\n<p>“Simplemente encuentro muy frustrante no poder hacer algo más”, dijo Kelley, que dijo que no recuerda haber escuchado de ninguna denuncia penal a un preparador en el distrito. “Esta gente abusa de los más pobres de los pobres”.</p>\n<p>Un portavoz de la Oficina del Fiscal Federal para el Distrito Este de Wisconsin declinó hacer comentarios.</p>\n<p>Thom Mrozek, portavoz de la Oficina del Fiscal Federal de Los Ángeles, reconoció que el personal ha sido especialmente reducido “en varios momentos durante los últimos 10 años”, pero dijo que está aumentando de nuevo. “Dedicamos nuestros recursos limitados después de evaluar los hechos de un caso individual, y también nuestro deseo de enfrentar los crímenes más serios y maximizar la disuasión en las áreas de más alta preocupación”.</p>\n<p>La oficina ha presentado algunas denuncias penales importantes por fraude en quiebras en años recientes. Pero hasta aquellos casos a veces terminan demostrando lo limitada que ha sido la vigilancia de las leyes de bancarrota.</p>\n<p>El pasado junio, el gobierno federal denunció penalmente a Mickey Henschel, que es una institución en Los Ángeles. En 1995, fue el sujeto de un perfil periodístico en el periódico Los Ángeles Times.</p>\n<p>El autor se maravillaba de que, a pesar de varias actividades supuestamente fraudulentas (incluyendo armar quiebras por gente ficticia), Henschel había logrado mantenerse fuera de la cárcel. Nueve años después, el Times hizo otro reportaje sobre Henschel, comentando, “uno de los sitios más seguros para cometer fraude es el Sur de California”, y otra vez se maravilló de su habilidad para eludir la prisión, a pesar de varios choques con la ley y un largo historial de supuesto fraude en quiebras.</p>\n<p>Ahora, cuando ya casi tiene 70 años, Henschel finalmente ha sido acusado penalmente por una supuesta trama de presentar bancarrotas falsas para dar falsas esperanzas a propietarios desesperados, entre otras tácticas. Su empresa ha cobrado más de 7 millones de dólares a sus víctimas, según los fiscales. Henschel se ha declarado no culpable. Su abogado no respondió a mis preguntas.</p>\n<p>Para los fiscales que han trabajado en el distrito, la existencia de operadores de largo tiempo como Henschel ayuda a explicar porque el fraude por quiebras es tan común aquí. Los estafadores enseñan su oficio a otros, que enseñan a otros más. Hoy en día las mañas ya están tan expandidas que no hay esperanza. Y la demanda, cuando la economía va mal, puede no tener límites.</p>\n<p>“Tenemos este problema mayor de fraude al consumidor aquí, y no tenemos ningún elemento de disuasión”, dijo Tighe. “Es una pena, porque da un mal nombre al proceso de bancarrotas para la gente que realmente lo necesitan y quienes lo están usando legítimamente”.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7958642.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jessica-huseman\">Jessica Huseman</a> </p>\n<p>In an unexpected executive order on Wednesday night, President Donald Trump abruptly dissolved the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which he’d set up after alleging with no evidence that he lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes. In a statement, he said the Department of Homeland Security will take up the commission’s mantle while avoiding the “endless legal battles” that bedeviled the commission in its brief existence. (For a history of the commission’s many woes and stumbles, see <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-short-history-of-the-brief-and-bumpy-life-of-the-voting-fraud-commission\">ProPublica’s chronology</a>.) But experts say the scrutiny and resistance that the commission faced will persist. They are skeptical DHS will achieve the results Trump claims.</p>\n<p>“Having watched the commission go up in flames, I don’t know that DHS personnel would be eager to follow their lead,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola University School of Law and former Department of Justice civil rights official. “You don’t normally want to be the second person to jump on a live grenade.”</p>\n<p>Echoing Trump, commission co-chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach told multiple news outlets on Wednesday night that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of DHS, would use the voter rolls already collected by the commission and compare them to a federal list of non-citizens — something he’s discussed as a possibility since the commission’s formation was announced in March. (It didn’t convene its first meeting until July.)</p>\n<p>Dale Ho, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project, scoffed at the idea, saying that DHS had the authority to begin such a match months ago when the commission first began to collect the data. “Why haven’t they been doing this the entire time?” he said. “I don’t think anyone should be particularly impressed.”</p>\n<p>Ho said the non-citizen list maintained by DHS is flawed. It includes only non-citizens who’ve interacted with DHS, according to Ho. Names remain on the list, he said, even after people on it have become U.S. citizens. “You may have been a non-citizen who interacted with DHS five years ago, then naturalized and registered to vote, and you would appear to be a non-citizen under this match,” he said.</p>\n<p>After the state of Florida sued to access the DHS database in 2012, the agency said the database was not foolproof and told the Miami Herald it was “not designed” to be used as a check on non-citizen voting. Ultimately, Florida’s use of the database resulted in a flawed analysis that the governor and secretary of state later apologized for.</p>\n<p>Levitt said DHS would understand the limitations of such a match, and may be hesitant to take on an imperfect project that would face the same scrutiny as the commission, creating a “sizeable distraction” from their real priorities — especially since the White House has already begun to distance itself from the work of the commission.</p>\n<p>Indeed, anonymous White House insiders took to the media on Wednesday night to distance the administration from the commission. One senior advisor told CNN the commission was a “shit show” that “went off the rails,” and said Vice President Mike Pence should have viewed the commission “as a shit sandwich and treated it like a book report.” Another official blamed the commission’s formation on Steve Bannon (who was essentially excommunicated by the White House yesterday), calling the commission a “blundered Bannon rollout” that “should’ve never been in place.”</p>\n<p>Levitt said DHS would likely face far more scrutiny than the commission if they did attempt that data analysis. “DHS is a real agency with real appropriations from Congress and real oversight authority from Congress,” he said. “They have to be very careful to keep to the purpose for which money is appropriated — OIG [the agency’s inspector general] and internal auditors take those responsibilities seriously, and their general counsel will be strict.”</p>\n<p>Matt Dunlap, a Democratic member of the voter fraud commission and the secretary of state for Maine, also said scrutiny — including his own — would continue. This fall, Dunlap sued the commission, asserting that it had left him out of its deliberations. Last month, a judge found in his favor, ruling that he was unlawfully excluded from the drafting process related to the controversial letter sent by Kobach to the states requesting voter data, and from meeting planning. The judge also ruled the commission must turn over documents Dunlap requested, which Dunlap says he will continue to demand even though the commission is no more.</p>\n<p>In his years as a public administrator, Dunlap said he’s never seen as much public interest as he did with the commission. He’s convinced that DHS would face the same pushback. “People don’t want their elections messed around with. They want them left alone,” he said. “If Secretary Kobach thinks he can escape public scrutiny of his work by exclusion and cloaking it even deeper, I think the American people may have a surprise waiting for him.”</p>\n<p>Kobach snapped back at Dunlap on Wednesday night, telling news outlets that Democrats both on and off commission “lost their seat at the table” because of their protests. For his part, Dunlap professed to be unbothered. “Good luck, buddy — the curtain has been pulled away,” he said. “Everyone is watching now.”</p>\n<p>Kobach did not respond to a request for an interview related to this story.</p>\n<p>Other groups who filed suits relating to the voter fraud commission also say they will continue their scrutiny. For example, the Brennan Center has sought to compel the Department of Justice, DHS and the Office of Management and Budget to disclose information regarding their work with the commission. Myrna Perez, the leader of the center’s Voting Rights and Elections project, says they will continue to pursue these disclosures.</p>\n<p>The ACLU also sued the commission, alleging that it failed to follow federal disclosure laws. Ho says these issues have not disappeared just because the commission no longer exists. “It doesn’t mean they get to shred everything now,” he said. “I still want to know what it is they’ve been concealing from the public, and I think the public deserves that.”</p>\n<p>Experts also say that, if DHS takes on the role of investigating voter fraud, it could harm work it is doing with states to shore up cybersecurity and prevent foreign intervention. Late in the Obama Administration, election infrastructure was declared “critical,” which allowed DHS to better help states collaborate with the federal government. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, said states initially viewed DHS intervention as federal overreach, but have now begun to productively work together. If DHS takes the lead on “a wild goose chase” to sniff out fraud, Becker argued, the necessary work of improving cybersecurity will suffer. “If DHS is being tugged in a different direction by the White House itself,” he said, “that could have a really detrimental impact.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7949242.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jessica-huseman\">Jessica Huseman</a> </p>\n<p>The controversy that swirled around the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity far exceeded its output. The commission made no decisions, issued no reports, and consequently had no impact on election laws. The group’s existence was brief: Its creation was announced in March. It had its first meeting in July, its second in September, and as of yesterday, it is no more.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-voter-fraud-commission-is-gone-but-scrutiny-will-continue\">unexpectedly dissolved</a> what was commonly referred to as the voting-fraud commission, saying it had been hampered by lawsuits and that the Department of Homeland Security will pick up the commission’s mission of sniffing out voting misbehavior. Here’s a quick history of the short-lived panel:</p>\n<p><strong>Even though no evidence has ever been proffered that millions of people voted illegally in the last presidential election...</strong></p>\n<p>Nov. 27, 2016: Trump <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/theres-no-evidence-our-election-was-rigged\">made such claims</a> starting days after he was elected, claiming on Twitter that he’d have won the popular vote “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”</p>\n<p><strong>He continued to make similar claims and then...</strong></p>\n<p>May 11, 2017: Trump <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124262\">signed an executive order</a> announcing the formation of the commission. The order indicated that it would investigate, among other things, issues “that could lead to improper voter registrations and improper voting, including fraudulent voter registrations and fraudulent voting.”</p>\n<p><strong>Even before it held its first meeting, the commission sparked intense controversy...</strong></p>\n<p>June 28, 2017: Kris Kobach, the co-chair of the commission, sent out a letter to every state (in many cases, to the wrong office) <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/presidential-commission-demands-massive-amounts-of-state-voter-data\">requesting publicly available voter rolls</a>. The letter caused confusion, as it requested information that isn’t public in any state — including Social Security numbers and military status of voters. Immediately, election experts saw red flags. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/election-experts-see-flaws-in-trump-voter-commissions-plan-to-smoke-out-fraud\">You can’t find voter fraud</a> in publicly available voter files, they said. There is not enough information, and the matches are too messy to draw any conclusions.</p>\n<p><strong>When it did meet...</strong></p>\n<p>July 19, 2017: Trump opened the first meeting, assuring the public the commission would be unbiased and fair. But by that point, several states had already <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trumps-voter-fraud-commission-meets-first-time\">refused to provide</a> the requested data <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-actions-taken-against-trump%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cfraud%E2%80%9D-commission\">and lawsuits were under way</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>So Kobach sent a second letter to states...</strong></p>\n<p>July 27, 2017: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/27/trumps-voting-commission-again-asks-states-for-voter-data-vows-to-protect-records/?utm_term=.f263d59b7074\">He pledged</a> data would “be kept confidential and secure throughout the duration of the commission’s existence,” and he promised not to release “personally identifiable information from voter registration records.”</p>\n<p><strong>Then the commission met again...</strong></p>\n<p>Sept. 12, 2017: This time, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/12/550518986/tension-and-protests-mark-trump-voting-commission-meeting\">in New Hampshire</a>. Democratic Commissioner and New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner hosted. The commission heard testimony on alleged voter fraud from one of its own commissioners, Hans von Spakovsky, and listened to John Lott (best known as the author of the book “More Guns, Less Crime”), who advocated that voting authorities run background checks like those employed when buying a firearm.</p>\n<p><strong>But about that letter...</strong></p>\n<p>Sept. 30, 2017: A court filing by the Department of Justice showed emails between Kobach and two long-time voter fraud activists — J. Christian Adams and Hans von Spakovsky — <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/whos-really-in-charge-of-the-voting-fraud-commission\">drafting the controversial letter</a> that requested troves of state data. Adams and von Spakovsky weren’t on the commission at the time, but would join later. Sitting members of the commission charged that they’d been denied the ability to see the letter before it was sent to states, even as two people who weren’t yet on the commission helped write it.</p>\n<p><strong>And then came the arrest for child porn...</strong></p>\n<p>Oct. 14, 2017: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/14/trump-voter-fraud-commission-researcher-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges/?utm_term=.db83d14ac38c\">The Washington Post</a> broke the news that a researcher for the commission, Ronald Williams II, had been arrested in Maryland after authorities say they found child pornography on his cell phone. (Williams has pleaded not guilty.) Williams had previously <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/conflict-mounts-inside-voting-fraud-commission-in-the-wake-of-child-porn-arrest\">worked closely</a> with Commissioner J. Christian Adams when they were both at the Justice Department. The commission declined to answer press queries about how Williams came to work for the commission, and commissioners Matt Dunlap and Alan King told ProPublica they had no idea he was on staff.</p>\n<p><strong>And questions arose about whether the commission could keep voters’ data safe...</strong></p>\n<p>Oct. 23, 2017: ProPublica raised questions about <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/crosscheck-the-voter-fraud-commission-wants-your-data-keep-it-safe\">serious data security problems at Crosscheck</a>, the program — created and run by Kobach — that he was championing as a tool to be used by the commission to sniff out fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>Dunlap decided to sue the commission he sat on...</strong></p>\n<p>Nov. 9, 2017: Dunlap <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-voter-fraud-commission-dunlap-lawsuit\">filed suit</a> in federal court, alleging that the commission had intentionally excluded him from deliberations and had violated federal transparency laws. By this point, it was one of several suits the commission faced.</p>\n<p><strong>The judge decided Dunlap had a point...</strong></p>\n<p>Dec. 23, 2017: The judge <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/2017/12/23/federal-judge-orders-voter-fraud-commission-to-provide-dunlap-with-documents/\">ruled in Dunlap’s favor</a>, finding that Dunlap had been unlawfully denied access to materials that he needed to participate in the commission’s work, and that the commission must turn over those documents. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaHuseman/status/944387103747657728\">judge also ruled</a> that Dunlap should have been allowed to consult on the letter Kobach drafted with von Spakovsky and Adams, and that he should have been allowed input into the agenda for the commission’s second meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Business as usual, it seems; Kobach says the commission should meet again in January...</strong></p>\n<p>Dec. 30, 2017: Kobach <a href=\"http://cjonline.com/news/state-government/2017-12-29/kobach-voter-integrity-commission-stalled-lawsuits-will-meet\">told a local news outlet the commission</a> would likely meet in January. This was news to Dunlap and King, who told ProPublica they hadn’t heard a thing about the commission ever meeting again.</p>\n<p><strong>And it turns out the commission won’t meet again.</strong></p>\n<p>Jan. 3, 2018: Shortly after the start of the new year, Trump canned it. Meanwhile, sources within the administration distanced the White House from the commission, telling CNN it was a “shit show” and telling Politico it was all Steve Bannon’s idea anyway. Kobach took to the airwaves, saying the commission’s work will continue through the Department of Homeland Security. But experts think those efforts <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-voter-fraud-commission-is-gone-but-scrutiny-will-continue\">could face many of the same problems</a> that plagued the commission. </p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7949243.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/robin-fields\">Robin Fields</a> </p>\n<p>A startling spike in recent years in the number of Texas women dying as a consequence of pregnancy or childbirth has spurred a furious debate over whether deep funding cuts to reproductive health services are to blame.</p>\n<p>A peer-reviewed study published today in the quarterly journal Birth could add a new dimension to the argument. It attributes part, though not all, of the increase in Texas’ maternal mortality rate — which is among the highest of any state — to a statistical mirage caused by misreporting on death certificates.</p>\n<p>According to vital statistics records, Texas’ maternal mortality rate — defined as deaths per 100,000 live births — jumped 87 percent, from 18.3 for the five years from 2006 to 2010 to 34.2 for 2011 to 2015. But researchers say it’s likely that some of the deaths classified as maternal in the second five-year period were mistakenly linked to pregnancy or childbirth. They estimate that, without these false positives, the real rate of maternal mortality in the state would have been somewhat lower.</p>\n<p>“I guess I was surprised how bad the data was,” said Marian MacDorman, a co-author of the study and a research professor at the University of Maryland’s Population Research Center. For instance, Texas vital records indicate that the mortality rate for expectant and new mothers over the age of 40 rose to 27 times that for younger women, a disparity that MacDorman termed “biologically implausible.”</p>\n<p>Such anomalies in the Texas numbers epitomize the woeful record keeping on maternal deaths nationwide. In the United States, where 700 to 900 women die annually from causes tied to pregnancy, maternal mortality rates have been rising for the last two decades as rates in other affluent nations have dropped. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-many-american-women-die-from-causes-related-to-pregnancy-or-childbirth\">U.S. data tracking such deaths is so shaky</a> that health authorities haven’t released an official annual count of fatalities, or an official maternal mortality rate, since 2007.</p>\n<p>Skeptics who question how much the U.S. maternal mortality rate has actually increased often cite a change in how maternal deaths are identified. For everyone who dies there is a death certificate, typically filled out by doctors and collected by state vital and local statistics offices. Since 2003, all states have added a checkbox to death certificates asking if the person who died was pregnant, or had been pregnant within the last year of their lives. The checkbox has made it easier to identify maternal deaths that previously had been missed — but also easier to misclassify deaths as related to pregnancy or childbirth even if they aren’t. One <a href=\"https://www.cdcfoundation.org/sites/default/files/upload/pdf/MMRIAReport.pdf\">recent analysis</a> of data from four states found no sign of pregnancy within the prior year for about 15 percent of women whose deaths were marked as related.</p>\n<p>The new study by MacDorman and co-authors Eugene DeClercq, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, and Marie Thoma, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland’s department of family science, looks at information from death certificates on numbers of maternal deaths and their causes, as well as the age of the deceased.</p>\n<p>To measure changes in Texas’ maternal mortality rates, the researchers grouped deaths classified on death certificates as maternal into two five-year periods: 2006 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015. Texas introduced the checkbox in 2006, so the death certificate form was consistent in that respect over the decade covered by the study.</p>\n<p>Researchers found that the numbers of deaths almost doubled from 366 in the first five-year period to 668 in the second. The maternal mortality rate for women over 40 more than doubled, comprising more than half of the increase in deaths overall between the two five-year periods. Researchers said this growth was more than could reasonably have been expected, and that it’s likely some of the deaths were not related to pregnancy or childbirth.</p>\n<p>In addition to the checkbox, another section of the death certificate asks for immediate, intermediate and underlying causes of death. Deaths classified as maternal and attributed to nonspecific causes such as “other” increased sharply in the 2011 to 2015 period, accounting for 197 of the 302 additional maternal deaths overall in these five years. Deaths of women over 40 were far more likely to be attributed to nonspecific causes than deaths of women under 40.</p>\n<p>The researchers compared Texas’ results for 2011 to 2015 to those from a <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2017/05000/Trends_in_Maternal_Mortality_by_Sociodemographic.6.aspx\">study</a> of maternal mortality in 27 states and Washington, D.C., in 2013 and 2014. Texas’ maternal mortality rates were 157 percent higher for women over 40 and 74 percent higher for deaths attributed to nonspecific causes, suggesting the state’s data problems may outstrip those elsewhere, MacDorman said.</p>\n<p>Still, even when researchers discarded all deaths of women over 40 and those attributed to nonspecific causes, the mortality rate in Texas went up 36 percent between the two five-year periods. That increase and “the large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities, warrant concerted actions by clinicians and policy makers,” the study concludes.</p>\n<p>From vital statistics data alone, MacDorman said, it’s impossible to determine whether this increase was caused by cuts to reproductive health care. In 2011-2012, the start of the study’s second five-year period, Texas slashed its family planning budget by two-thirds and rejected federal funding for a Medicaid women’s health program.</p>\n<p>Even before the study was published, experts in Texas had doubts about basing its maternal mortality rate solely on vital statistics information, said Lisa Hollier, chairwoman of the state’s Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force. Established in 2013, the task force conducts in-depth case reviews of maternal deaths in the state, using medical records and other information.</p>\n<p>“We were aware that there were important limitations to the vital statistics data,” she said.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<div>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/severe-complications-for-women-during-childbirth-are-skyrocketing-and-could-often-be-prevented\">\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-3x2.jpg 1200w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-3x2.jpg\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/severe-complications-for-women-during-childbirth-are-skyrocketing-and-could-often-be-prevented\">Severe Complications for Women During Childbirth Are Skyrocketing — and Could Often Be Prevented</a></h3>\n<h4>The rate of life-threatening complications for new mothers in the U.S. has more than doubled in two decades due to pre-existing conditions, medical errors and unequal access to care.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>Hollier said Texas lawmakers have set aside funds to try to improve death investigations and the accuracy of information on death certificates. Texas is also experimenting with ways to give real-time feedback as doctors and others use the pregnancy checkbox, she said. These steps, in combination with her committee’s work, should improve the reliability of the state’s data on maternal deaths, she said.</p>\n<p>But she, too, acknowledged that when the task force issues its report later this year with findings from its first round of case reviews, its snapshot of maternal mortality in the state is likely to be troubling. </p>\n<p>“I think the rate is likely rising based on the best information that we have right now,” Hollier said. “I think that having any maternal deaths that are preventable is too many. So yes, I think that when we’re really able to present a complete picture of what maternal mortality looks like in Texas, the rate will be too high. The rate of preventable maternal death will be too high.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7947789.gif\" height=\"1\">",

      "summary": {
        "content": "<p>\nby <span>Kiera Feldman</span>, The Investigative Fund </p>\n<p>Shortly before 5 a.m. on a recent November night, a garbage truck with a New York Yankees decal on the side sped through a red light on an empty street in the Bronx. The two workers aboard were running late. Before long, they would start getting calls from their boss. “Where are you on the route? Hurry up, it shouldn’t take this long.” Theirs was one of 133 garbage trucks owned by Action Carting, the largest waste company in New York City, which picks up the garbage and recycling from 16,700 businesses.</p>\n<p>Going 20 miles per hour above the city’s 25 mph limit, the Action truck ran another red light with a worker, called a “helper,” hanging off the back. Just a few miles away the week before, another man had died in the middle of the night beneath the wheels of another company’s garbage truck. The Action truck began driving on the wrong side of the road in preparation for the next stop. The workers were racing to pick up as much garbage as possible before dawn arrived and the streets filled with slow traffic. “This route should take you twelve hours,” the boss often told them. “It shouldn’t take you fourteen hours.”</p>\n<p>Working 10- to 14-hour days, six days per week, means that no one is ever anything close to rested. The company holds monthly safety meetings and plays videos, taken by cameras installed inside the trucks, of Action drivers falling asleep at the wheel. “You’re showing us videos of guys being fatigued, guys falling asleep,” a driver told me. (All Action employees asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation.) “But you aren’t doing anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“In the history of the company I am sure there have been times where supervisors have inappropriately rushed people,” said Action Carting CEO Ron Bergamini. “They shouldn’t be, and they’d be fired if they ever told people to run red lights or speed. But you have to find the balance between efficiency and safety, and that’s a struggle we work on every day. But you cannot turn around and say, ‘Hey just take your time, go as long as you want.’” He pointed out that workers can anonymously report concerns to a safety hotline. As to the questions of overwork and driver fatigue, Bergamini responded, “That’s a struggle that the whole industry has — of getting people to work less.”</p>\n<p>In the universe of New York’s garbage industry, Action is considered a company that takes the high road. A union shop, it offers starting pay of about $16 per hour for helpers and $23 for drivers, far more than many other companies. And unlike some other companies, Action provides high-visibility gear and conducts safety meetings. But since 2008, the company’s trucks have killed five pedestrians or cyclists.</p>\n<p>In New York City overall, private sanitation trucks killed seven people in 2017. By contrast, city municipal sanitation trucks haven’t caused a fatality since 2014.</p>\n<p>Pedestrians aren’t the only casualties, and Action isn’t the only company involved in fatalities. Waste and recycling work is the fifth most fatal job in America — far more deadly than serving as a police officer or a firefighter. Loggers have the highest fatality rate, followed by fishing workers, aircraft pilots and roofers. From the collection out on garbage trucks, to the processing at transfer stations and recycling centers, to the dumping at landfills, the waste industry averages about one worker fatality a week. Nationally, in 2016, 82 percent of waste-worker deaths occurred in the private sector.</p>\n<p>There are two vastly different worlds of garbage in New York City: day and night. By day, 7,200 uniformed municipal workers from the city’s Department of Sanitation go door-to-door, collecting the residential trash. Like postal workers, they tend to follow compact routes. They work eight-hour days with time-and-a-half for overtime and snow removal and double-time for Sundays. With a median base pay of $69,000 plus health care, a pension, almost four weeks of paid vacation and unlimited sick days, the Department of Sanitation workforce is overwhelmingly full time and unionized. It’s also 55 percent white, and 91 percent male.</p>\n<p>But come nightfall, an army of private garbage trucks from more than 250 sanitation companies zigzag across town in ad hoc fashion, carting away the trash and recycling from every business — every bodega, restaurant and office building in the five boroughs. Those private carters remove more than half of the city’s total waste.</p>\n<figure>\n<h3>One Night on a Private Garbage Truck in New York City</h3>\n<p>New York’s residential trash is hauled away by the city, but private companies collect trash thrown away by businesses, making hundreds of stops each. <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/nyc-garbage\">Follow one driver’s route.</a></p>\n<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/nyc-garbage\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://propublica.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/story/20180104-truck-route.gif\"></a>\n</figure>\n<p>Since each business chooses its own carter, a dozen garbage trucks might converge on a single block over the course of a night. In one five-block stretch near Rockefeller Center, for example, 27 garbage companies stop at 86 businesses, according to an analysis of city data by ProPublica and the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute. Plenty of other U.S. cities split trash collection along the same lines — residential waste on the municipal side, commercial waste on the private side — but New York is singular in the scale of private collection operations.</p>\n<p>Many waste companies pay workers a flat fee, some as little as $80 a shift, no matter the hours, with no health benefits, overtime pay or retirement plans. The practice of employing helpers off the books is widespread, according to a 2016 report by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration. The workforce is more than 60 percent minority, and more than half of Latino workers and about a third of black workers earn less than $35,000 annually. Many of these jobs are non-union, and while the drivers tend to be full-time employees, the helpers are often contract workers with unstable hours — some scrambling to work enough to feed their families, others clocking 18-hour or longer days. A May 2016 study by the nonprofit New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health found that the underpayment or nonpayment of wages is “rampant in the commercial waste industry.”</p>\n<p>Five Star Carting, the third biggest garbage company in New York City, with 10,400 customers, has received numerous citations from the New York State Department of Labor for underpayment or nonpayment of wages. In 2015, after two Five Star workers testified at a City Council hearing about their long hours, low pay and unsafe work conditions, they were fired. (They were later reinstated but only after labor advocates and City Council members organized a rally outside of Five Star’s headquarters.) Five Star declined to respond to detailed questions.</p>\n<p>Private garbage trucks are ubiquitous on New York’s streets after dark, yet the human effort involved remains largely invisible to most people. To travel deep into the world of New York’s midnight trash collection is to enter a realm where people often toil in grave danger for low pay. Those perils are easy to miss in the roar of a diesel engine, the rush of a giant truck and a waft of scent from a bag we’re all happy to see somebody else remove.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>My first night following a garbage truck was on a sweltering Thursday in July 2016. After many rejections, I had persuaded a driver to let me follow him for a shift. He was taking a big chance: Workers can get fired in an instant, but he was willing to risk his job to take me into his world. What I saw opened the door to a far more complex investigation than I’d anticipated, one that involved dozens of interviews over 18 months with drivers, helpers, regulators, owners and experts; combing through thousands of pages of civil and criminal records; reviewing hundreds of documents obtained through public-records requests; and building a database of federal truck inspection records.</p>\n<p>That night in 2016, Alex Caban prepared for his shift as a garbage truck driver at #1 Waste and Recycler. New York was then in the middle of the city’s longest heat wave in 14 years. In his apartment above a deli in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Caban dressed quickly in a black T-shirt, black Dickies and black leather work boots. Hot trash and its many leaky juices will soil anything lighter. Caban, a garbage man of three years, does not like to look dirty.</p>\n<p>Caban snacked on banana chips while he drove his minivan to the company yard, a gravel lot on an industrial stretch of Pacific Street in Brooklyn where freight trucks, buses and pit bulls are kept behind chain link fences. He prefers to drive to and from work so that when he heads home at the end of his shift soaked in what workers call “garbage juice,” he is not the person in the subway car that other riders move away from. “They think you’re a bum,” Caban explained, wrinkling his face for effect. An animated 45-year-old, Caban spoke in a Puerto Rican staccato, one thought tumbling excitedly into the next. He looked a decade younger with his wire-rimmed glasses, shaved head, and — when he wasn’t working — a button-down shirt and a brimmed hat.</p>\n<p>Caban arrived at the yard. Awaiting him was Bilal, 18, an immigrant from Yemen (he asked to be identified only by his first name). A “helper,” Bilal would spend much of the night riding the back “stepper” of Caban’s aging green garbage truck. Several lights were smashed in the rear, and the driver’s side door hung crookedly behind the cab, offering a view inside of ripped seats. Faded lettering on the side recorded the truck’s past lives. (“UNDER CONTRACT TOWN OF ISLIP”) showed it had once hauled trash in a Long Island town. (“PUT YOUR CANS IN OUR HANDS”) pointed to time in the recycling business.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-iesi-truck-body-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-iesi-truck-body-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-iesi-truck-body-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-iesi-truck-body-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Dumpsters (known as “containers” in the business) can fall and maim — or kill — workers. <span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Caban hoped for the same things that every garbage worker hopes for at the start of each shift. No crashes. No injuries. No fires in the hopper. No truck breakdowns. In Caban’s five weeks of driving for #1 Waste, something was always breaking down. One night it was the transmission, he said, another the radiator, another the compactor. Twice the brakes failed, he said — this on a 10-wheeled vehicle that weighs about 40,000 pounds without a load of garbage and more than 80,000 pounds with. Making it home alive each night was a small victory. (#1 Waste and Recycler did not respond to a detailed list of questions.)</p>\n<p>It was shortly after 6 p.m. on a night that could last past eight in the morning. Caban stepped up through the opening where the driver’s side door should have been. His helper, Bilal, rode shotgun. The engine growled, the throttle shaking the truck’s body, and with a blast of black exhaust, Caban pulled out and took a right on Classon Avenue, the broken driver’s side door flopping in the breeze.</p>\n<p>Rushing makes the job more dangerous, and most everyone has to rush in order to finish hundreds of stops — sometimes more than 1,000 — in a night, covering a route that could easily be 85 miles. As most any private sanitation worker in New York City will tell you, the routes are often too long to finish within the 11-hour driving limit set by federal Department of Transportation regulations. As a result, many garbage truck drivers routinely drive far more than the 11-hour limit, hardly getting any time to rest before they must return to the wheel.</p>\n<p>After working a double shift in August 2016 that lasted nearly 23 hours, Queens County Carting driver William Bonds was fired after refusing to work another double shift less than two days later. On the first shift, Bonds had fallen asleep at the wheel. He was worried he might kill someone. (Queens County Carting owner Michael Bilik acknowledged in an unemployment hearing that Bonds routinely worked 60 to 80 hours a week, and his dispatcher explained that daytime drivers sometimes worked doubles when the company was short nighttime drivers. An administrative law judge found that Bonds “had good reason for refusing overtime that day ... feeling exhausted and incapable of driving the truck.” Bonds is now a plaintiff in a negligence lawsuit against the company.)</p>\n<p>It doesn’t help that many rigs are in terrible condition. Garbage trucks from New York City’s 50 biggest companies are pulled off the road and declared unsafe to drive after 53 percent of government inspections, according to an analysis of data from the city and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Fourteen of those 50 companies hadn’t been inspected even once in the past two years. Nationally, commercial trucks are pulled off the road after 21 percent of inspections.</p>\n<p>The industry doesn’t display a lot of urgency on safety issues. In October, garbage company owners, lobbyists and city officials held an event billed as a Safety Symposium, where industry participants seemed more eager to blame cyclists than take responsibility. “We’ve been talking about as an industry what we’ve been doing,” said Bill Falletta, safety manager of Action Carting, whose truck killed 27-year-old cyclist Neftaly Ramirez in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn on July 22. “Is there anything being done to educate the bicyclists on safety? They should be following the same traffic rules that we do. I very rarely see that.” Later, when a city official explained that — although it was perhaps counterintuitive — narrower streets are actually safer because they slow the flow of traffic, David Biderman, an industry lobbyist, raised his hand and asked if narrower bike lanes could be used to slow down bicyclists. The consensus seemed to be that two-wheeled transportation was the real menace on the road.</p>\n<p>Said City Council member Antonio Reynoso at a Nov. 27 hearing on safety in the industry: “I thought by now that we would have seen more change, and we haven’t.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In real life, the need to move fast trumps traffic rules as often as not. On the July night I spent following Caban’s truck, it barreled past restaurant supply stores of Atlantic Avenue, made a right on Franklin Avenue, a left on Dean Street and another left on Kingston Avenue. Along the way, Caban and Bilal, his helper, sent bags sailing through the air from the curb into the street and from the street up into the truck’s back hopper. From Broccoli Farm to Superior Market, from Subway to Fulton Gourmet Deli, Caban made his way down the 500 stops on his route sheet, leaving a plume of hot garbage odor in the truck’s wake. Delis, liquor stores, laundromats, grocery stores, pharmacies, pizzerias, restaurants — Caban’s stops went from Crown Heights to Fort Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick in Brooklyn, and then to the Lower East Side, Midtown, the Upper East Side, Harlem, East Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-teamwork-new-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-teamwork-new-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-teamwork-new-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-teamwork-new-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-teamwork-new-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Maneuvering a dumpster into the back of a garbage truck is a two-man job. When the driver is at the wheel, a “helper” often calls out directions from the back.\n<span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Setting up, as it’s called, is the foundation of successful — which is to say fast — driver-helper teamwork, and it requires both driver and helper to memorize the entire route sheet. The drill worked like this: Bilal jumped off the back stepper, raced ahead to a stop, and began to toss or drag garbage bags from the curb to the street. Caban, meanwhile, parked the truck to align its back hopper with the garbage and ran around back in time to help heave the bags from the street into the hopper.</p>\n<p>If a helper is skilled, like Bilal, and if there are multiple stops on a single stretch, he won’t wait for the driver but run ahead and continue setting up stops along the route. Tonight, Caban would often drive further ahead, get the stops with lighter bags himself and then circle back to get the set-up garbage. And if a helper is really, really fast, by the time Caban drives back the helper will have returned to where he started, and together the two can quickly make their way down the set-up stops.</p>\n<p>Helpers change from night to night, and having a good helper is the difference between Caban working 10 hours and 15. In Caban’s estimation, Bilal is “the number one helper” at #1 Waste. “He dazzles me every time,” said Caban. Bilal knows the art of the set-up and he knows the route; he knows when and where to sprint ahead.</p>\n<p>Theirs was a carefully choreographed routine, their faces set and focused, every motion swift and economical to shave off the seconds and the minutes. At a stop on Verona Place, Bilal threw bags over a parked silver Jeep, Caban catching one in mid-air and tossing it in the hopper, like a perfectly executed assist. At the Kennedy Fried Chicken on Marcus Garvey Boulevard, Bilal hopped off the back of the moving garbage truck, sprinted ahead to the curb, motioned back-up directions to Caban with a few quick flicks of the wrist. Caban then jumped out to get the bags while Bilal sprinted through traffic to the next stop. Caban then ran back into the truck and drove diagonally across the intersection to meet him. Repeat. “It’s a beautiful thing,” Caban said, and it was.</p>\n<p>Baby-faced, with a ready grin, Bilal looked young for his 18 years and barely weighed more than some of the bags he was lifting. He wore a blue and white striped polo shirt, and neither he nor Caban wore reflective vests — they said #1 Waste hadn’t provided any safety equipment. Workers say that’s common in the industry. Caban and Bilal purchased their own thin black cloth work gloves with traction on the fingers (about $15 for a pack of three, which might last a week or two). Cloth won’t protect against the glass that often protrudes through the garbage bags, but nobody wears thick leather safety gloves. The grip is bad and slows you down; you’re liable to lose your hold on the slick plastic bags and punch yourself in the face.</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-garbage-slime-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-garbage-slime-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-garbage-slime-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-garbage-slime-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-garbage-slime-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A single garbage truck might pick up 20 or 30 tons in a night. When the compactor runs, “garbage juice” spurts out the back. <span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Private carting companies have been part of the fabric of New York since the early 1900s. The carters handled trash in commercial areas, and municipal sanitation workers picked up the trash everywhere else, residential and business alike. That changed in 1957 when the city decided that commercial trash was too much trouble. Suddenly, all businesses had to pay for their trash collection. The Mafia quickly carved the city into territories. Under what was called the property-rights system, each stop was “owned” by a specified hauler. Attempting to underbid another carter was considered to be “stealing” his customer. Garbage haulers colluded, submitting uniformly high price estimates to a customer. Then the stop’s owner would offer a slightly lower estimate to win the contract — a practice better known as bid-rigging.</p>\n<p>Controlled primarily by the Gambino and Genovese crime families, four trade waste associations enforced the property-rights system — the cartel — using extortion, threats and violence. Favored tactics involved baseball bats, firebombing garbage trucks and the occasional murder. When Browning-Ferris Industries, a major national waste company, tried to enter the market in 1993, an executive found the severed head of a dog on his doorstep one morning. A note was stuffed into its mouth: “Welcome to New York.”</p>\n<p>“It was an open secret for four decades that the mob was in control of the commercial carting industry,” explained Daniel Castleman, former head of investigations in Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau’s office. Castleman was a script advisor for “The Sopranos” and even played the federal prosecutor who tried to take down Junior Soprano. The show’s fictional universe was very much representative of reality, Castleman said. “There’s a reason that Tony Soprano was in the carting industry.”</p>\n<p>In the early 1990s, Morgenthau’s office launched an undercover investigation of the industry. An NYPD agent posed as “cousin Danny” in a Brooklyn carting company, another posed as a building manager, and another as a Browning-Ferris Industries employee. Secret recordings confirmed the existence of the property-rights system and its control by mob members. The first of many rounds of indictments came down in 1995, and ultimately 72 defendants were charged: carting companies, owners, trade waste association leaders, the trade waste associations themselves, and the capos and soldiers they reported to.</p>\n<p>In 1996, the city passed Local Law 42, aimed at cracking the cartel, and created the licensing agency that is now known as the Business Integrity Commission to root out organized crime. The waste industry fought the reforms, but its suit against Local Law 42 was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The prosecutions brought down the cartel. Many leaders went to jail, had their assets seized and agreed to a lifetime ban, called a debarment, from the industry. Others were never prosecuted but still signed debarment agreements. Some people on BIC’s debarment list moved their companies out of town or sold them.</p>\n<p>But many on the debarment list simply handed their companies over to their wives or sons, who continued in the industry. Being related to someone on the debarment list is not grounds for the denial of a BIC license. (Haulers must be of “good character, honesty, and integrity.”) More than one person told me the sins of the father should not be imputed to the son … but you might want to want to take a close look at anyone related to past cartel members.</p>\n<p>To get a flavor of the sometimes dizzying ways in which families and entities intertwined, consider the Toscano family and its waste operations. In 1975, a company called TNT Carting was one of 55 haulers in New York that pleaded guilty to restraint of trade. TNT’s officers included Thomas J. Toscano and his brother Nicholas. Later Thomas J. Toscano founded Mr. T Carting. A nonagenarian, today he fills a more ceremonial role in the company (currently the fifth-largest hauler in New York), while his grandson Thomas N. Toscano is the company’s CFO.</p>\n<p>For their parts, Nicholas Toscano and several other family members were debarred from the industry. They had started a spin-off company in the 1980s called Mr. N Carting on <a href=\"https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentImageView?doc_id=FT_3520001370852\">land</a> purchased by a realty corporation based at the <a href=\"https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentImageView?doc_id=FT_3510001370851\">same address</a> as Mr. T Carting. (“The companies were completely separate. It was strictly a tenant-landlord relationship,” explained Thomas N. Toscano. “There’s an old saying, ‘You can’t pick your family.’ So, you know, we had nothing to do with them.”)</p>\n<p>For all the upheaval, many cartel-era companies survived the transition. For example, Liberty Ashes, Mr. T Carting and New Style Waste Removal Corp (now Boro-Wide Recycling) were all members of the trade waste associations in the days of the cartel, according to lists recovered from the associations’ offices during the execution of search warrants in 1995. “You couldn’t do business in this industry without being members of those associations,” explained Thomas N. Toscano. “Yes, we were members. Yes, we paid dues. And the only time they ever went there was every three years when the union negotiation came up.” The Brooklyn association pleaded guilty to criminal restraint of trade in 1997, and the Queens association pleaded guilty to a criminal antitrust violation in 1998.</p>\n<p>Lupe Todd-Medina, a spokesperson for New Yorkers for Responsible Waste Management, an industry group, responded to questions sent to multiple companies, including Liberty Ashes, New Style Recycling, Viking Sanitation and Boro-Wide Recycling. Todd-Medina did not address the detailed questions regarding the individual companies, but did provide a general statement: “The companies addressed in your story are all privately-held businesses — many of which are multi-generational,” she wrote. “For more than twenty years, the city’s Business Integrity Commission regulates [sic] the industry’s operations, and granted licenses to these companies following an intensive review process that independent observers agree has restored the industry’s competitiveness and high level of service to its customers.”</p>\n<p>Still, the industry has its fair share of eyebrow-raising episodes. In late 2012, the BIC <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/downloads/pdf/denials/final_conclusion_%20investigation_of_frank_coppola_%20by_bic_11-20-14.pdf\">told Mr. T Carting</a> that it couldn’t hire a convicted drug trafficker with ties to the Gambino and Lucchese crime families as a sales representative. Thomas N. Toscano, the CFO of Mr. T Carting, then <a href=\"http://trashkingpinsnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mr-T-Carting-and-Coppola-v.-Shari-Hyman-Complaint.pdf\">sued</a> the BIC in an attempt to keep the employee, which proved unsuccessful. (“They literally put the poor guy on ice after he had quit his other job,” said Toscano of the employee, who the BIC had previously approved to work for another carting company.)</p>\n<p>In August 2016, the de Blasio administration released a study that recommended reining in the chaos of New York’s waste and recycling industry by dividing the city into zones. A company would make a bid to collect the garbage from all of the businesses in a given zone, and the city would pick the winner. According to the study, which was done by the Department of Sanitation and the BIC, zoning could reduce truck traffic by up to 68 percent and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 64 percent, leading to “cleaner air” and “safer streets,” as well as improve recycling rates, customer service and worker safety. A handful of cities, including Seattle, San Jose and Los Angeles, have introduced zoning. The efforts in Seattle and San Jose have yielded improved recycling rates and higher wages; the changes in Los Angeles are still being implemented.</p>\n<figure>\n<h3>One Block, Many Trucks</h3>\n<p>Many blocks in New York are visited by numerous private carters in the course of a night.

Today, again, zoning has the support of the de Blasio administration but legislation has yet to be introduced in the City Council — and the industry is still resisting. In 2016, the haulers launched NYRWM, which has spent $298,000 lobbying city officials. In her statement, Todd-Medina blasted zoning as “an arbitrary system,” arguing that it would “eliminate customer choice, decrease industry employment, and increase costs to businesses …” On the NYRWM website, prospective members are invited to contact the group’s general counsel/secretary-treasurer, a lawyer named Ray Shain who was disbarred from practicing law in New York in 2003 after pleading guilty to a criminal bid-rigging, bribery and kickback scheme that defrauded Queens public schools out of an estimated $6.3 million. (“Ray Shain is engaged as counsel to NYRWM, and provides administrative support for its operations,” said Todd-Medina in her written statement. She pointed out that he was re-instated to the bar several years ago and “does not own or operate a waste services business.”)</p>\n<p>Industry opposition notwithstanding, the de Blasio administration is pressing forward with its reform efforts. The Department of Sanitation has hired consultants who are developing a proposal for what zoning might look like in New York. The exact number of zones is to be determined — Los Angeles has 11, for example — but only one company would operate in each. That suggests most of the city’s 250 private carters would have no chance at winning a bid. Even as it stands, the smaller companies tend not to last long; bigger companies snap them up. The 20 biggest companies in New York currently generate 80 percent of the revenue, according to the 2016 study, with the other roughly 200 operators fighting over the rest.</p>\n<p>In Caban’s view, the old days were the golden era of garbage. If a man worked himself to the bone, he could earn enough to buy a house and a car and send a kid to college. Working the night shift at a garbage company in New York basically had all the perks of working the day shift at the Sanitation Department. Almost every garbage company in the city was in the same union, Teamsters Local 813, and every three years, the union would rent out the ballroom at the Sheraton Hotel so garbage men could ratify the contract, which achieved routine raises, triple-time pay for snow duty, as well as paid holidays, vacations and a pension.</p>\n<p>That changed after the sweeping prosecutions of the 1990s. The gates were opened for a flood of non-union companies, and citywide collective bargaining became a thing of the past. “They got the mob out. But the workers got screwed royally,” said Teamsters organizer Allan Henry.</p>\n<p>Powerful AFL-CIO-affiliated unions like the Laborers and the Teamsters were edged out of private garbage operators. They were replaced by “independent unions” that cut sweetheart deals with employers, locking employees into jobs with low wages and poor benefits. One example is a union called LIFE 890, which represents workers at major New York City garbage companies including Boro-Wide Recycling, Liberty Ashes and Five Star Carting.</p>\n<p>A man named John N. Mongello runs the union and its health care benefit plan out of a residential townhouse in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that he and his wife Kathy purchased in 1988. In 2016, LIFE’s benefit plan paid John Mongello $199,000 and his daughter Jessica Mongello Gambino took home $103,000. The union pays an LLC owned by Kathy $90,000 per year in rent, and the whole family — his wife, two daughters and a son — has been on the payroll in various capacities, off and on, since 2000. Filings with the Department of Labor show that administrative expenses have consumed as much as 45 percent of the health care fund’s expenses. Mongello was indicted in 1978, when he was president of a different union, on federal charges of conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of labor hearings. In 1985, he resolved the case, pleading guilty to making false claims; he was sentenced to 360 months’ probation and a small fine. (LIFE 890 and John Mongello did not respond to a detailed list of questions.)</p>\n<aside>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Workers at several LIFE 890 shops, meanwhile, have said they’ve either never heard of the union or rarely see its representatives. And to the extent that the union plays a role, it hardly seems like a champion for its workers’ wages. At Liberty Ashes, the LIFE 890 contract sets starting pay at $0.25 per hour above minimum wage in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>Perhaps as a result of such stances, companies seem more enthusiastic about LIFE 890 than workers do. When LIFE 890 attempted to replace the Teamsters as the union at Planet Waste last year, company owner Tom Tolentino told the Daily News he favored LIFE 890, claiming the Teamsters pension plan could bankrupt the company. The workers then voted to join LIFE 890. (Tolentino declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>In a wage-related class action lawsuit filed against Five Star in 2014, LIFE’s representative submitted an affidavit that supported the company rather than the workers the union ostensibly represents. “Nino [Tristani] is very quick to respond to my emails and address the grievances,” the union rep said of Five Star’s cofounder, “and is open to discussing the best way to resolve the issue.” Five Star settled with 61 workers in 2016 for $400,000 without admitting liability; LIFE 890 members were excluded from the settlement because the union’s contract mandates arbitration for grievances.</p>\n<p>LIFE 890’s role is at issue in a current suit in Manhattan federal court, in which former Liberty Ashes workers are suing over unpaid overtime wages. The company argues that the plaintiffs lack legal standing to bring the case on the grounds that all pay disputes must be addressed in arbitration proceedings. As it happens, LIFE 890 added a mandatory arbitration clause to the Liberty Ashes contract in December 2016 — just weeks before the company submitted it as evidence — which lawyers for Liberty Ashes maintain should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p>A federal judge expressed skepticism about that position. “It seems to me at least counterintuitive that an employer and current employees through their union would be able to negotiate away rights of former employees,” said the judge, Richard Sullivan, in a hearing in February 2017.</p>\n<p>When I described LIFE 890 to Ronald Goldstock, the former director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, he emailed me a law review article on labor racketeering, defined as “the use of union power for personal benefit.” Goldstock said, “This is right out of the playbook. I think a DA’s office would be very interested.”</p>\n<p>Independent unions have helped lower wages across the industry. In 1985, a helper started out making $16 an hour. At #1 Waste in 2016, Caban — a driver — made less.</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-broken-glass-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-broken-glass-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-broken-glass-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-broken-glass-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-broken-glass-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Broken glass is among the many perils for those picking up trash. <span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The sun hadn’t even set, and Caban was already tired. On Sunday and Monday, Caban had a helper who didn’t know the route, so they were on the road for 14 1/2-hours each shift and didn’t finish up until 8:30 a.m. Six days a week on the nightshift made it hard for anybody to ever get enough sleep. Caban usually woke in the afternoon, and before long it was time to head back to the yard. On Saturday, his one day off, his body ached and he was too exhausted to leave his apartment. Days passed where Caban hardly talked to anyone outside of work.</p>\n<p>Caban raced down Marcy, west on DeKalb, and north on Bedford, following a circuitous route and running more red lights than one could count. As the hopper filled with bags spurting garbage juice, Bilal pulled a lever on the right side to “run a cycle,” bringing the blade down to grab the bags. Then he pulled it again to “send it up,” packing the garbage into the truck’s body.</p>\n<p>If there was one thing Caban was grateful for each night, it was that his route involved only garbage bags — no containers (what laypeople call dumpsters). When he had worked with containers at previous jobs at Viking Sanitation and La Vega Carting, he faced the constant fear of being crushed. Wrestling a container into the back of a garbage truck is a precarious maneuver, and it can easily slip and fall on you — a common way to die or lose a limb in this industry, according to the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>\n<p>After three years on the job, Caban was marked from head to toe. He had a deep scar on his left leg (stitches after glass in a bag sliced open his calf). On his right leg, there was crosshatching below his kneecap (more glass), and below that another scar from the time he missed when jumping onto the back of a Viking Sanitation garbage truck as it hurriedly pulled away (a jump he might have landed had he not been so exhausted at 5 a.m.). Then there was the deep indent on the left side of his head “about four inches behind what used to be my hairline,” Caban explained: A winch once slipped off a Viking container and smashed open his skull. Perhaps the most gruesome injury was from November 2013, when another Viking worker moved a container at just the wrong moment, crushing his hand. That night, he lost the tip of his right index finger.</p>\n<p>That severed finger was how I originally found Caban. I was tracking down injuries in New York City’s waste industry through contacts from a Teamsters local. Caban entered my notes as “severed finger #5.”</p>\n<p>Missing finger #1 was Sidney Marthone, a former Five Star Carting worker. He severed his left middle finger while emptying a broken container. “If you make a complaint about safety, they just stop calling you to come and do work,” said Marthone, a young Haitian immigrant. (A spokesperson for Five Star Carting declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>After Marthone, I found three men who’d worked at Liberty Ashes who each lost a finger on the same garbage truck — Truck 11 — according to a review of workers compensation records and interviews with five workers. Several workers said the company had removed a safety latch in the back that would have locked in the container while it was being emptied. Liberty’s containers were too big to fit the latch, the workers said, so the company took it off instead of spending the money to buy new containers. The three amputations occurred between 2010 and 2016: First, Lenny Menna, a driver, severed a pinkie. Then came Luis Acevedo, a helper, who also severed a pinkie. A third worker lost his ring finger in early 2016. (Michael Bellino, Jr. of Liberty Ashes said, “I’m well aware of incidents that have happened with my company.”) Menna and Acevedo are plaintiffs in the wage and hours suit against the company.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-luis-acevedo-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-luis-acevedo-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-luis-acevedo-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-luis-acevedo-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Luis Acevedo, a former helper at Liberty Ashes, is one of three workers who lost a finger on the same garbage truck.

Instead, it’s a regulatory patchwork: The city’s Department of Sanitation oversees what’s done with the waste itself, the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation oversees the waste transfer stations, the state’s Department of Transportation inspects the trucks, and the city’s Business Integrity Commission handles licensing and background checks to determine that a company isn’t mobbed up.</p>\n<p>That leaves the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a federal agency with 67 inspectors for millions of workers in the state of New York, to look after the wellbeing of the workers. Waste companies “routinely violate OSHA requirements,” according to the 2016 study by the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health. Removal of a safety latch is the kind of thing that would probably warrant an OSHA citation, but Liberty, according to OSHA’s database, has never received one; what’s more, the company has never been inspected, according to several FOIA requests of OSHA. (Todd-Medina, speaking on behalf of Liberty Ashes, declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>A missing safety latch can claim more than a finger. In 2014, a helper at Flag Container Services on Staten Island was crushed to death after a container slipped. His truck had no safety latch. OSHA fined the company $7,000, the maximum allowable by law.</p>\n<p>Drivers devise inventive ways to make do with broken equipment and run-down garbage trucks. As Rodney Miles, a former driver at Five Star, put it, “You’ve got to know the distance.” Which meant: the length it took for his truck to come to a rolling halt. On his truck, moving below 25 miles an hour, he estimated the distance was the length of five cars. “If you were going down a hill with no load on it, you stand a better chance of stopping,” he said. “But if you have a load, then forget about it.” Twice, Miles said, unable to stop suddenly, he crashed into other vehicles. Another night, a wheel of his garbage truck came rolling off while he was driving on Canal Street in Staten Island. On a different night, both the brakes and the steering failed. “God was with me that night. I avoided death and killing somebody else,” Miles recalled. (Trucks from Five Star Carting are pulled off the road for being unsafe after 69 percent of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspections. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>Workers at companies large and small told similar stories. At Queens County Carting, Ernesto Waight said he drove one truck where the shifter would suddenly jump into reverse, and another where a wheel rolled off on Astoria Boulevard in Queens. After Wilson Perez’s brakes failed exiting the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, he said, a supervisor told him to drive the truck back to the yard regardless. Carl Orlando said he drove one truck where the dashboard caught fire. Orlando recalled another shift, this one on a cold winter night, when the air line in his brakes froze. To stop the truck, he crashed it into a utility pole.</p>\n<p>Queens County’s owner, Bilik, disputes that his trucks were ever “anything less than safe,” adding “we have recently replaced almost our entire fleet.” And he denies that a driver would ever have been required to drive a truck he’d flagged for failing brakes. Queens County trucks were pulled off the road for being unsafe after 12 of the last 16 inspections, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>Federal Department of Transportation regulations require that truck operators maintain logbooks of inspections, but Orlando and Perez allege that Anthony LaPuma of Queens County Carting gave instructions to falsify the records. “You put ‘Everything is good’ on the report, and then you write on a piece of paper what is wrong and you give that to the mechanic. When you get pulled over, the DOT will see that everything is good,” Perez remembered LaPuma saying. (Bilik called the allegation “fictional.” He added, “We run a tight ship here.”)</p>\n<p>In 2007, LaPuma was among four defendants <a href=\"http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2007/november/lombardo_lapuma_mistretta_11_08_2007_ind.pdf\">indicted</a> in Queens for trying to take over another waste company by setting fire to garbage trucks, stealing 205 of their containers and threatening to kill the owner. LaPuma pleaded guilty to first-degree attempted falsifying of business records, a felony. He did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At 7:30 p.m., Caban made his way south on Franklin Avenue in Bed-Stuy, reversing diagonally against traffic through the intersection at Lafayette Avenue to get the garbage from a deli across the street from Dough Donuts, then drove diagonally back into southbound traffic. Bilal perched on the stepper with his back pressed to the truck (hanging wide increases the odds of getting knocked off and run over, another common way to die, according to the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health). When the squeeze was tight with a parked car, Bilal swung gracefully from the back right stepper up into the truck’s hopper.</p>\n<p>With less experienced helpers, Caban taught them what they needed to know. “Place your back, your legs, and your arms like if you’re swinging a golf club,” he explained. Swinging a bag like a baseball bat will risk spraying garbage juice in your partner’s eyes or mouth. Hold the bag away from your body to avoid gashes from glass. For lighter bags, use a down-and-up-and-over torso twist-swing. For heavier ones, over 70 or 80 pounds, do a full 360-degree spin-and-drag move, not unlike an Olympic hammer throw, using the weight of the bag to gain momentum.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-back-stepper-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-back-stepper-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-back-stepper-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-back-stepper-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-back-stepper-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Falling off the back of a garbage truck is a common way for workers to be killed on the job. A bump in the road or a tight squeeze with a parked car could easily lead to getting run over. <span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>At the Putnam Deli on the corner of Classon Avenue, Caban tossed bags into the hopper and then ran inside to get his first bottled water of the night. Caban, who is Muslim, chatted in Arabic with the proprietor while Nancy, the bodega cat, looked on. Arabic was one of several languages he taught himself in jail.</p>\n<p>Caban has a rap sheet that included several felonies and trips “upstate,” as he called New York state prison, for drug, violence and other convictions. Caban readily admitted that his criminal record was “messed up,” and as a result his job options were severely curtailed. To his great frustration, he knew there were many other kinds of work besides hauling garbage that he was capable of doing: work that paid more and was far less dangerous. But those doors were closed. Driving for Uber, for example, was forever out of reach. He applied for a license from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission and was denied. “So you see,” said Caban, “I’m forced to work in this type of company.”</p>\n<p>For many men with a criminal record, private sanitation is one of the few jobs they can get. When Caban got out of jail, he began as a helper at Viking Sanitation, in south Brooklyn. His first night on the job, he showed up and hopped aboard the back stepper — no training at all, a common way to start in this industry. Other helpers showed Caban the ropes, and after two years of hanging off the back of a garbage truck, he passed the commercial driver’s license exam and road test, and received a license to drive vehicles that weigh more than 26,000 pounds. In making the leap from helper to driver, he went from $120 to $200 per night at Viking. At #1 Waste, he made $1,000 a week working six days a week, routinely driving more than 10 hours a night.</p>\n<p>Caban’s dream was to work at New York City’s Department of Sanitation, but between his criminal record and the intense competition, he couldn’t believe that would ever happen. Picking up residential trash is one of the city’s most coveted municipal jobs. In 2015, more than 68,000 people took the sanitation civil service exam; it was the first time in eight years DSNY had offered the exam, and the department hires only about 500 people a year off the list. With seniority and overtime, experienced workers can make $90,000 or more annually. The job, which requires no college degree, offers a chance at a comfortable middle-class life, a five-day work week and the promise of upward mobility.</p>\n<p>Of the many private sanitation workers I talked to for this story — more than 20 in all — again and again I heard the same longing. In their eyes, DSNY workers have won the lottery. One night shift worker said, “We look at them like you made it.”</p>\n<p>Municipal sanitation work is still dangerous, to be sure, but workers undergo weeks of training, and the safety regulations are strict. In recent years, DSNY removed the back steppers from its entire fleet after pressure from the Teamsters.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-anthony-carmona-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-anthony-carmona-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-anthony-carmona-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-anthony-carmona-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Anthony Carmona started out at as a helper at Viking Sanitation, where he made $120 per night, no matter the hours. He later got a break: a better-paying job at a company called IESI.\n<span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The difference between the day shift and the night shift can be measured by pace. In New York, the municipal garbage man almost never runs. He walks. The private carters also work far more hours and hoist way more trash. “We’re going crazy sweating bullets,” said Anthony Carmona, who worked with Caban at Viking Sanitation. “Department of Sanitation, you see them chilling. I wish I could work like that.”</p>\n<p>Carmona still hopes for a city job, but he has since achieved the next best thing: a spot at one of the top private companies. Carmona knew a guy who pulled some strings and got him hired by IESI, the second-largest waste hauler in New York City. It’s a Teamsters shop where starting pay for helpers is $22.40 an hour. The job was still backbreaking — it requires picking up far more tons per night than the day shift at the city — but IESI workers had a pension to look forward to. With overtime, a helper could pull in $70,000-$85,000; an experienced driver at IESI could make $80,000-$110,000 a year. And with that comes medical coverage, paid vacations and sick days. When he wasn’t on the back of an IESI truck — a behemoth outfitted with all the bells and whistles, like a back-up camera for the driver to monitor — he was dreaming of the vacation days he’d save up.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Eric Hyde, another Viking helper, had been cut from working three days a week, to two days, to one day — never knowing which day it’d be, making it nearly impossible to hold a second job. Hyde was now close to losing his apartment. On the Department of Sanitation hiring list, his number was 63,019.</p>\n<p>In this industry, everyone hopes for a break, but few will get one. Hyde said simply: “I’m probably going to die on the back of the truck.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As the night wore on, Caban started treating red lights like stop signs: Slow down, look both ways, then go. A little before 9 p.m., Caban stopped at a deli on Pulaski Street, at the edge of Bushwick — a new stop his boss added to the route the night before with a short text message. Routes were always getting longer, but the nightly pay stayed the same.</p>\n<p>Caban made his way down Broadway in Brooklyn, then headed to Speedy Gas on Metropolitan Avenue to refuel. It was their first, brief rest after four breakneck hours. With his glasses atop his head, Caban played a phone game while Bilal put 62 gallons of diesel into the truck’s underbelly tank. Then Caban handed him a plastic bag and a rubber band. “Be sure to make it nice and tight,” Caban told him. “Strong—strong like bull.” Their truck had no gas cap.</p>\n<p>Shortly before 10 p.m., Caban headed to Hi-Tech Resource Recovery, one of New York’s 60 waste transfer stations (half of which are located in three black and Latino neighborhoods — north Brooklyn, the south Bronx and southeast Queens). Hi-Tech, which looks like a massive warehouse from the street, sits in an industrial but gentrifying area now known as East Williamsburg. From Hi-Tech, the garbage would get loaded onto long-haul trucks and carted to landfills and recycling centers hundreds of miles away.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-hi-tech-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-hi-tech-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-hi-tech-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-hi-tech-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-hi-tech-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A private garbage truck dumps a load at Hi-Tech Resource Recovery, one of New York’s 60 waste transfer stations. From there, long-haul trucks transport the refuse to distant landfills and recycling centers.\n<span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>From there, Caban headed toward the Williamsburg Bridge. He would spend the second half of the night in Manhattan, picking up cardboard. Garbage and cardboard can’t (or rather, shouldn’t) mix in the truck. On other nights, the order was reversed: garbage stops in Manhattan then cardboard stops in Brooklyn. Learning the route meant memorizing which stops were which — garbage or cardboard — and on which days of the week, and how much to pick up (businesses pay by weight). A stop might be only cardboard on a Wednesday, or only garbage on Mondays and Thursdays, or only garbage on Tuesdays, or every day.</p>\n<p>How did he keep all the stops straight? “You learn. Trust me,” said Caban. “If you don’t learn, you don’t get to drive for them too often.” Businesses tend to complain about smelly trash left on their curb, or getting a ticket for a pile of cardboard that never got picked up.</p>\n<p>Caban stopped at a deli, a pizzeria and a grocery on Pitt Street just above Delancey Street on the Lower East Side. He carried a small packing knife with a retractable blade of about 2.5 inches, using it to slash through the cords of unwieldy bundles of cardboard, making the job go faster. Cardboard can be easier than garbage — at times it’s lighter — except when it isn’t. Some stops had 300-pound bales of cardboard, which Caban and Bilal had to lift together, bringing them from the pavement to a winch mounted onto the back of the truck. Tonight, luckily, it did not bash his head in.</p>\n<p>To stay awake the rest of the night, Caban followed his routine: coffee, Red Bull when it got bad and 5-Hour Energy when it got really bad. As the hours wore on, the streets grew quiet. That was another reason he kept the packing knife on him. One night they were stopped on a deserted Manhattan street, and three guys jumped Bilal and punched him, according to Caban. He came to Bilal’s rescue with his knife at the ready.</p>\n<p>Caban and Bilal made their way up First Avenue. On other nights he continued up to the top of Manhattan, to stops at 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, but not tonight. Tonight, the two men picked up cardboard from the Crown Fried Chicken on 163rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, then headed west to Broadway and south. A fish market, a pizzeria, a deli, Boost Mobile, another Crown Fried Chicken — toward Second Avenue and then all the way back downtown.</p>\n<p>When Caban passed other garbage trucks, they honked their horns in salute. “We know we down in this shithole together,” he said.</p>\n<p>The stops became a blur. By the end of the night, when Caban did stop for red lights, he fell asleep at the wheel.</p>\n<p>A little before 4:30 a.m., he parked the truck back at the yard. Pacific Street was desolate. Caban and Bilal had made good time, finishing the route in about 10 1/2 hours. Still, Caban was exhausted.</p>\n<p>Driving back to his apartment, he passed the hulking armory building on Pacific Street, a homeless men’s shelter dubbed Grayskull Castle. He had lived there after getting out of jail. After he got the job at Viking Sanitation and got a place of his own, each injury that put him out of work left him feeling one step closer to Grayskull Castle.</p>\n<p>He got home and took a shower. The next night he would do the same thing again.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-driveby-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-driveby-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-driveby-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-driveby-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-driveby-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>An IESI driver looks past his window. Private garbage trucks are ubiquitous on New York City’s streets after dark, yet the human effort involved remains largely invisible to most people. <span>(Michael Santiago for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<p>July turned into August 2016, and Caban’s garbage bags grew heavier and juicier. In the summertime, New Yorkers go out more and spend more money, making more garbage for workers to lift off the street. On a summer night, a truck might pick up five or 10 more tons than it would in the winter.</p>\n<p>The next time I checked in with Caban in late summer, he told me he was too tired to talk. Eventually, Caban and I lost touch.</p>\n<p>This fall, I learned that he is incarcerated. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I took the Q100 bus to Rikers Island to find out what had transpired in the year since. The bus pulled up to the front building, the planes of LaGuardia Airport visible just across the water. The passengers — almost entirely women and children on their way to visiting hours — got off. There was space set aside near the entrance to park strollers.</p>\n<p>It would take almost four hours to make it through the many rounds of metal detectors, searches and long periods of sitting in waiting areas that lead to other waiting areas. “Jail is mad stressful,” said a young woman who was visiting her boyfriend. She laughed, then grew quiet and put her head in her hand. “I feel like I live here.”</p>\n<p>Alex Caban entered the large gymnasium that served as a visiting hall and took a seat across the table from me. To my right, an inmate in a gray jumpsuit smiled down at a toddler in his arms. The wall to the left was a big Sesame Street mural: Bert and Ernie waved while Grover flew above in the sky holding aloft the New York City Department of Correction shield. Caban recounted the events that led him to Rikers. I committed what I could to memory; a guard had instructed me to put my notebook and phone in a locker.</p>\n<p>Caban said his trouble began in August 2016, when he got a call about an opportunity to earn more money at another carting company. “I never should have left #1 Waste,” he said.</p>\n<p>As Caban told it, two of his new coworkers repeatedly used a Latino slur against him. Soon, Caban was at the end of his rope. On Aug. 31, 2016, according to Caban, the slurs continued and things heated up. He took out his packing knife and stabbed one of the coworkers. “I’m not a young guy like they are,” said Caban by way of explanation. “I didn’t want to fight them.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20170104-alex-caban-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20170104-alex-caban-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20170104-alex-caban-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20170104-alex-caban-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Caban landed a day shift job at a company that offered something elusive to many in the industry: a weekend. “All of us,” said Caban, “we try to make it.” <span>(Courtesy of Alex Caban)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Caban was arrested but got out on bail. He then bounced around working at different garbage companies. He had a short stint back at #1 Waste, but then one night while driving a truck that he said was missing a side mirror, he backed into a woman’s new Volkswagen. His career at #1 Waste was soon over.</p>\n<p>In the spring, Caban landed at a company called Yankel’s. He began driving a roll-off truck — the kind that typically carries a 10- to 40-cubic yard dumpster that “rolls off” onto the ground. Whereas before Caban heaved garbage by hand, now the machinery of the well-maintained Yankel’s truck did the lifting. Plus, it was a day shift job with a proper weekend: The owners were observant Jews, and all work came to a halt before sundown on Fridays. Caban posted photos online of himself at the wheel, happy to finally be driving a truck that other men would call pretty. “This truck smells like new car!” he told friends.</p>\n<p>But soon it was time to head to court again. He pleaded guilty to a third-degree misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to a year in jail, which he began serving in June 2017.</p>\n<p>Inmates at the Eric M. Taylor Center, where Caban was incarcerated, often do the trash pick-up for the ten jails on Rikers Island. But Caban said he was working in a bakery, where he likely earns less than 50 cents an hour. For once, he told me, he has enough time to sleep, exercise, pray and read books, most recently “Lies My Teacher Told Me,” a critique of the Eurocentric history taught to schoolchildren. Caban told me that Bilal, his helper from the summer before, is now working as a driver for #1 Waste.</p>\n<p>Caban was thinking about the future, and it was weighing on him. He was now 46. If he returned to the garbage man’s life of working six nights a week and sleeping days, when would he ever meet someone, let alone go on a date? A nice meal out on a Saturday night, he told me, would surely end with him falling asleep at the table. “I can’t be alone anymore,” he said. This was a theme I’d heard again and again from other workers. Relationships failed, marriages ended. “You’re never there,” I offered, echoing the words of other men. “And when you’re there,” Caban added, “you’re not there.”</p>\n<p>Caban looked forward to his release in 2018. He said he might take some garbage shifts to save up money, but ultimately he wanted to move on up in the world of commercial trucking: getting a Class A license. He wanted to drive a car-transport tractor-trailer or perhaps a big rig. Or maybe he and some friends would buy some property to fix up and start a business of their own. His career as a garbage man, he hoped, was coming to an end.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-far-view-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180104-far-view-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180104-far-view-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180104-far-view-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180104-far-view-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>\n<span>Michael Santiago for ProPublica</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7946377.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/sandhya-kambhampati\">Sandhya Kambhampati</a> </p>\n<p>If you want to know how much money the city of Chicago spends on holiday parade security in a given year, you can file an open records request with the city for the details. </p>\n<p>If you want to know how a college president spends his or her time, you can ask for his or her official calendar through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). </p>\n<p>FOIA allows anyone to request information from the government. In my first six months at ProPublica Illinois, I’ve sent over 1,018 requests for information, to everyone from the Department of Transportation to the state lottery.</p>\n<p>As a data reporter, I need to understand what information government bodies across the state keep, how they keep those records and what they don’t retain in documents or databases. To do that, I need to know different state and local agencies, and maintain a list of contacts throughout the state.</p>\n<p>Finding your way through some of the records systems is like walking in the dark — and getting information can take a lot of time. While I’ve sent requests all over the country, I’ve learned Illinois has its own quirks. </p>\n<p>Here are a few things I’ve learned about FOIA in Illinois that might help you get the information you want.</p>\n<h3>Tip 1: Do your research and know the law. Be patient and diligent about follow-ups.</h3>\n<p>Filing records requests takes time, persistence and putting a bit of pressure on officials to have them produce information on time. Illinois law requires agencies to respond to requests within five business days, so typically I give them a call if I don’t hear back when the deadline passes. </p>\n<p>With every request, I think about how agencies might respond and where they might raise objections. Here’s a sample <a href=\"http://foia.ilattorneygeneral.net/pdf/Sample%20FOIA%20Denial%20of%20Request%20Letter%20v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">denial letter</a>, as well as a <a href=\"http://foia.ilattorneygeneral.net/pdf/Sample%20FOIA%20Grant%20of%20Request%20Letter%20v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sample grant of request</a>, I like to reference. </p>\n<p>Compared to other places where I've filed FOIAs, agencies in Illinois seem more likely to immediately ask for an extension and they often cite the same reason.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-5businessdays.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-5businessdays.png 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-5businessdays.png 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-5businessdays.png 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-5businessdays.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>Then there are agencies that try to scare you away by suggesting that fulfilling a request will take a ridiculously long time. Unfortunately, this tactic is not unique to Illinois.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-hoursoftime.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-hoursoftime.png 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-hoursoftime.png 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-hoursoftime.png 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-hoursoftime.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>In this case, the agency initially claimed it would take 542 days to comply with my request. Once I explained how they could more easily do the work, 542 days turned into three. </p>\n<p>Sending out these requests also requires me to know the <a href=\"http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/government/FAQ_FOIA_Public.pdf\">exemptions</a> to the law that allow agencies to withhold information from a request. For example, I know I can’t get law enforcement records that interfere with an open case; business trade secrets or personal information (social security numbers, for instance) that could identify a person. Other exemptions include information that, if disclosed, could compromise national security or endanger someone’s life or physical safety. </p>\n<p>If you believe a request has been wrongly denied, you should be prepared to appeal. Anyone can request review from the Illinois Attorney General’s Public Access Counselor (PAC), which helps to resolve open records requests, within 60 days of a denial of a request. I find that it also helps to keep diligent notes about your dealings with employees and any correspondence with the agency.</p>\n<p>If I didn’t have a system for tracking my records requests, I would run the risk of letting them slip. So I keep a spreadsheet that includes notes on each request, which FOIA officer is handling it and the date of the initial response. </p>\n<p>The state requires every agency to display and make a directory available designating who its FOIA officers are on its website and how requests should be sent (electronically or through mail). I’ve had to think about alternative ways of finding records officers, especially in smaller towns where there are often just four or five municipal employees, and there’s no official website. Sometimes, the only way I can get a phone number or a name of the FOIA officer is to do some deep diving on social media or in newspaper clippings. Here’s a list of some <a href=\"https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/FOIA-Contacts.aspx\">FOIA officers</a> in Illinois. </p>\n<p>And perhaps the most important point about knowing how to make a request: If the records are available on the agency’s website, don’t ask for them. It’s only going to show them you’re not doing your research.</p>\n<h3>Tip 2: Many agencies still keep their records on paper. That means requesting them is not always easy.</h3>\n<p>Some agencies only allow inspection of documents in person because the time it will take them to scan the documents is “too burdensome,” a common exemption used in FOIA. Others might tell you that since they have the data in paper records, they can’t answer a specific question about the data for you in a timely manner. For example, an agency might have to hand-enter staffing data from paper records just to be able to provide you with the total number of employees in a certain department.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-paperrecords.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-paperrecords.png 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-paperrecords.png 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-paperrecords.png 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180103-FOIAFOLLIES-paperrecords.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>Some agencies send documents only on floppy disks, CDs or flash drives. Others send a large manila envelope of documents complete with a rubber band bow for you to hand enter or scan into electronic format.</p>\n<p>And some agencies send you the records exactly as you ask for them. Sometimes, they send it the same day or even hours after you file your request. (Thank you!) </p>\n<p>As a data reporter, roughly 80 percent of my job is cleaning and wrangling data from inconvenient formats (like paper) into databases. When agencies send Excel spreadsheets printed and scanned in with hand-written notes, I have to spend time extracting the data using special software or hand-entering the data. So even though an agency is complying with the law and giving us the information we have asked for, it’s a given that we’ll have to do more work to even use the information and deduce any sort of finding. </p>\n<h3>Tip 3: Remember, there’s a human being behind every record and document. So play nice.</h3>\n<p>Some FOIA officers try to discourage people, especially reporters like me who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandhya__k/status/921098952392544256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.propublica.org%2Farticle%2Fjournalism-and-foia-freedom-of-information-act\">pester them</a> for records. And sometimes, you even see their complaints about your requests.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">4/ It can take a lot of pestering and patience to get open records. And sometimes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOIA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FOIA</a> officers accidentally tell you how annoying you are: <a href=\"https://t.co/qJuisbAwp7\">pic.twitter.com/qJuisbAwp7</a></p>— Sandhya Kambhampati (@sandhya__k) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandhya__k/status/921098952392544256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2017</a></blockquote>\n\n</figure>\n<p>I try to remember that there are countless other people asking for records and the agency I’m dealing with might be juggling many other requests. I like to get to know FOIA officers, understand what irritates them, how they prefer I communicate — via email or phone — and what times are most convenient to reach them. I save all this information in a spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>Because I send so many FOIA requests, I need a game plan for tackling each department. If I make consecutive requests to the same department several days in a row, I could tick off some employees. So I keep a log of all the information I’d like to request, call the FOIA officer to see what they have on their plate, and begin negotiating. For example, for our <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes\">Documenting Hate project</a>, I’ve sent requests to police departments all over the state and asked for several years of hate crime data. Rather than ask for all 10 years of data at once, I work out a schedule that is convenient for me as well as the records departments, especially in small jurisdictions. </p>\n<p>I also follow up on my requests at the same time and same day every week, so the FOIA officer knows I’m diligent. It also puts a bit of pressure on them, I think. Illinois FOIA officers seem to appreciate the reminders, though I can imagine some find my badgering them for records annoying. </p>\n<p>In my experience, Illinois FOIA officers have generally been helpful in leading me to other agencies that may have records I’m seeking if their agencies don’t have them. Show that you value their time, and sometimes they’ll come through for you. </p>\n<p>Perhaps the best tactic is to actually go the agency, meet records officers and ask them to show you how they do their work. It’s easier to understand the process when you find out the agency keeps its documents in a closet or a musty old basement filled with boxes of files. One agency I visited had lost data because a pipe burst in the records closet. Their workers were forced to enter handwritten notes and tally up information from water-damaged paper records. </p>\n<p>These visits also let you see the programs and software an agency uses, which is especially useful when they tell you they can’t export your records because they use some obscure government computer program. Also you’ll see if they do, in fact, get 15 calls a day for records and have to go through various hoops to find the data, wrangle it and redact it. </p>\n<p>The time you’ll spend on these visits is worth it when you get information that had been sitting on a bunch of floppy disks, just begging for someone to analyze and report on it.</p>\n<h3>Tip 4: Always FOIA the FOIA requests and know how they keep their data.</h3>\n<p>You’re probably wondering what have I asked for in my thousand-plus records requests? Well, out of all my requests, I’ve received 803, or 79 percent of them. Some of them were FOIAs on the FOIAs — so asking for what other people have asked for. If you know what records have already been granted, you can request the same records and not have to wait months for your data. So ask for the agency’s FOIA logs.</p>\n<p>I’ve also asked for the record retention schedules for state agencies, which help me understand how and where the agencies keep their records and how often they shred them. The record retention schedules are an index, with codes for each department and each kind of document the agency keeps. When I get them, I add their shredding calendars to a master calendar. That allows me to know when they are going to purge their records, so I can request them before they disappear.</p>\n<p>I’ve also digitized these schedules, so our reporters can search them. This is helpful when we’re requesting documents; the more specific we can be, the faster and easier it will be to get what we need.</p>\n<p>These skills have helped me navigate the systems of Illinois, but I know there’s much more to learn. </p>\n<p>My hope is that with each FOIA request, I can shine a light on information we can use to tell a larger story and encourage government to be more transparent.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7945671.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/megan-rose\">Megan Rose</a> </p>\n<p>Three weeks after <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-dubious-arrest-compromised-prosecutor-tainted-plea-how-one-murder-case-exposes-a-broken-system\">ProPublica published a story</a> detailing how a Baltimore prosecutor had failed to abide by the terms of a plea agreement, the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office has reversed course.</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Rich Gibson <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/4341464-Gibson-Motion-Rehearing-Smith-Case.html\">filed a motion</a> in Baltimore City Circuit Court last week saying he had erred and asking a judge to schedule a new hearing for Demetrius Smith. Smith had tried in July to revise a dubious plea deal by asking the judge for a sentence modification that would have essentially cleared his record. Gibson had opposed his request and wrongly claimed the judge didn’t have the power to change Smith’s sentence.</p>\n<p>“Demetrius should not be saddled with a felony conviction, and we are grateful that the court has another opportunity to consider Demetrius's case,” Barry Pollack, Smith’s pro bono lawyer, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Smith’s complicated ordeal began in 2010 when Gibson won a conviction against him for a murder he didn’t commit. Then, spooked by that wrongful prosecution, Smith reluctantly agreed to an Alford plea for an unrelated shooting that he also said he didn’t do. An Alford plea allows a defendant like Smith to assert his innocence while still accepting that the state has enough evidence to convict him nonetheless.</p>\n<p>As part of the Alford plea agreement, Gibson agreed that should Smith prove his innocence in the murder case, he could go back to court to revisit the Alford plea — and, most importantly, that the judge would have sole discretion to decide Smith’s fate. In other words, Gibson agreed that as the prosecutor he was giving up the say he typically would have over changes to Smith’s deal. Smith was adamant about this aspect because he didn’t want the plea keeping him in prison if his life sentence for the murder was vacated.</p>\n<p>In August 2012, Smith was exonerated in the murder, for which the federal government successfully prosecuted the real killers. As a result, the state’s attorney’s office agreed to change Smith’s Alford plea sentence to time served, and conceded that there were some issues with the facts in the shooting. Smith left prison and was cleared of the murder charge but nevertheless remained convicted of the shooting, which greatly impacted his ability to live and work freely. The hearing in July was his chance to fully clear his name of that lingering felony.</p>\n<p>But despite the terms of the plea deal, Gibson argued that Smith’s sentence could only be changed with the prosecutor’s approval, and the judge denied Smith’s request. It appeared to close all legal doors for Smith except for a pardon from the governor.</p>\n<p>Then, on Dec. 27, after ProPublica’s lengthy story about Smith, Gibson wrote to the court and acknowledged that during the initial agreement hearing the state did “relinquish its ability to block the motion.” Therefore, he asked the court to schedule a new hearing on the sentence modification, so the “court can rule as it determines proper.”</p>\n<p>Judge Barry Williams has scheduled a new hearing for Jan. 18.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7935637.gif\" height=\"1\">",

For most of the court’s history, the justices have only signaled their fixes and edits by adding the word “modified” in small type to newly issued print and digital versions of the opinions.</p>\n<p>The changes thus have proved hard to find — not just for the general public, but for lawyers and judges and scholars of the law.</p>\n<p>Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, an advocacy group pushing for judicial transparency, thinks that’s a problem.</p>\n<p>“The court does what it can to obscure its mistakes and to obscure some of the finer points of what they do,” Roth said.</p>\n<p>Most changes in opinions are minor — fixing a fact or two, not altering a constitutional determination. But some of the changes made have been substantial.</p>\n<p>One of the court’s most infamous rulings — <em>Scott v. Sanford</em>, which in 1857 held that African Americans whose ancestors arrived as slaves could not be U.S. citizens or sue for their freedom — was heavily altered shortly after its release. Chief Justice Roger Taney added more than a dozen pages to the <em>Scott</em> majority opinion, largely to defend against arguments another justice made in a furious dissent. Taney did not show the rest of the court his rewrite before publishing the final opinion.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Richard Lazarus, a Harvard University law professor, exposed the court’s methods for handling mistakes in a <a href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/rlazarus/docs/articles/LazarusRichardTheNonFinalityOfSupremeCourtOpinionsFullVersionOct14.pdf.pdf\">law review article</a>. Lazarus dove into archival files, the working papers of retired justices, and proofs of opinions to unearth the backstories for several altered opinions, including the <em>Scott</em> ruling. He argued the Supreme Court should better notify the public of its revisions since the opinions are widely referenced and quoted.</p>\n<p>“Serious practical problems arise when the version of the court’s opinion upon which lower courts, other branches of government, and scholars and teachers rely can change, without notice, as many as five years after initial publication,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3912897-The-Non-Finality-Of-Supreme-Court-Opinions.html#document/p62/a395434\">Lazarus wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>After the article, the court took a step toward greater transparency. Since 2015, the court’s website has <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/15\">flagged opinions</a> that are modified after their initial release. It now also posts digital copies of the decisions that highlight edits.</p>\n<p>However, this reform applies only to recent decisions. Finding earlier changes can be challenging, and details about the revisions — how the errors happened or were uncovered, for instance — are rarely in the documents.</p>\n<p>This year, ProPublica fact-checked a sampling of the Supreme Court’s majority opinions from 2011 through 2015, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/supreme-court-errors-are-not-hard-to-find\">found several errors</a> — including a couple of glaring inaccuracies in big decisions. A ruling that struck down part of the Voting Rights Act featured incorrect voter registration data. Another that helped reshape criminal sentencing relied on flawed studies claiming that judges were <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/suspect-evidence-momentous-supreme-court-decision-criminal-sentencing\">punishing defendants erratically</a>. The bad information came from legal filings, from government records and from the justices’ own independent research.</p>\n<aside>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>To date, the court has not corrected those errors. ProPublica sent the court questions about its practices for revising opinions, but the court did not respond. Chief Justice John Roberts and the other justices have repeatedly declined to comment when ProPublica provided them with our findings. “As a matter of policy the court does not comment on its opinions, which speak for themselves,” Kathleen Arberg, spokeswoman for the court, wrote in a September email denying interview requests.</p>\n<p>There will be little, or no, public notice if justices later fix the errant opinions. And there is slim chance the court will ever explain its revisions.</p>\n<p>Federal laws dictate what happens to presidents’ and lawmakers’ work documents, which detail what government officials have done and why. Those records often become the public’s property.</p>\n<p>But no statute or regulation governs justices’ internal records. Further, the court does not even have in-house policies for its files, Jill Lepore, a New Yorker magazine staff writer, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/great-paper-caper\">reported in 2014</a>. The justices themselves have complete control.</p>\n<p>“They can shred them; they can burn them; they can use them as placemats,” Lepore wrote. “Texts vanish; e-mails are deleted. The court has no policies or guidelines for secretaries and clerks about what to keep and what to throw away.”</p>\n<p>The court also has not permitted much access to the minimal information it does release about changes in opinions.</p>\n<p>In the course of his research, Lazarus sought copies of the “change pages” that mark revisions in rulings for publishers. He obtained one year’s worth of the pages from an online service before the Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court, which disseminates opinions, directed the service to stop. The Reporter didn't respond to Lazarus’ direct requests for change pages until after his law review article published.</p>\n<p>“My view is that they impeded my efforts,” Lazarus told ProPublica. “The Reporter’s view is that they were agnostic.”</p>\n<p>Justices have occasionally been more open about fixing factual errors when the mistakes became embarrassing. But they never offer a full accounting of how the mistakes occurred, how they decided to correct them and whether they verified the rest of their facts.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the court ruled in <em>Graham v. Florida</em> that juvenile crimes other than homicide cannot bring life sentences in prison without parole under the Eighth Amendment, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Anthony Kennedy undertook his own research in the course of writing the majority opinion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334696-FSU-Nonhomicide-Report.html\">A study of life sentences for juvenile offenders</a> by Florida State University professors became central to the court’s decision. It determined that such penalties were very rare. Only 109 juveniles were serving life sentences for crimes less than homicide nationwide, the study found, of which 77 were in Florida.</p>\n<p>The study included data from 47 states. Lawyers for the state of Florida argued the research was not comprehensive nor independently vetted, and should not be trusted.</p>\n<p>Kennedy sought to fill in the missing data. The Supreme Court’s library sent letters to officials in the states that did not provide information to the Florida State professors and to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, asking for a count of juvenile life sentences for non-homicides. All provided information to Kennedy, and the justice added the new numbers to the earlier study’s tally. (He also counted an Oklahoma case based solely on a newspaper report.)</p>\n<p>In the opinion, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333214-08-7412-Original.html#document/p13/a394284\">Kennedy wrote</a> “there are 129 juvenile non-homicide offenders serving life without parole sentences.” A few days after the ruling, the Solicitor General’s Office, lawyers representing federal agencies, notified the court that its number was inaccurate. The prisons bureau had sent Kennedy a list of six inmates serving life inmates for juvenile crimes, but each of those convictions had involved homicide.</p>\n<p>The justice used data he collected without double-checking it. Kennedy edited the opinion to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333215-08-7412-Revised.html#document/p17/a394283\">subtract the federal inmates</a> from his count and include a footnote acknowledging the error.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7926254.gif\" height=\"1\">",

And I had a challenge to conquer. The story I was onto was not going to flatter Mississippi. But I did promise him I would not go searching for the toothless.</p>\n<p>I had come to write about the mentally ill in Mississippi, in particular those who wound up in jail, accused of often serious crimes but denied — for months and even years — the basic legal requirement that they receive a mental evaluation. Such evaluations — to determine whether the defendants were sane at the time of the alleged crime and competent to stand trial for those crimes — would profoundly shape the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>Tyler Haire was one of those I wanted to write about. He was 16 when he was arrested for stabbing his father’s girlfriend. She survived, but Tyler, with a mental health case file thick with diagnoses, went to jail. He waited nearly four years for the evaluation a judge ordered be done as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The sheriff in Calhoun County barely knew of me when I arrived, and Tyler’s family didn’t know I was coming at all. But they let me into their homes, their jail, their lives. Then they let me come back, again and again.</p>\n<p>They and others in Mississippi — families, sheriffs, mental health professionals, politicians — wanted their stories of deep frustration told.</p>\n<p>It was, they felt, a Mississippi embarrassment that would be helped by greater, even national, attention.</p>\n<p>I soon learned that it wasn’t only the accused who sat waiting in jail. The state’s mental health resources were so scarce that families saw troubled loved ones who needed hospitalization wind up behind bars simply for want of an available bed in a treatment facility.</p>\n<p>One sheriff had a veteran in his jail a few years back. The veteran hadn’t committed any crime. He was in jail waiting for a bed at a state hospital or a crisis center. The Veteran’s Administration hospital let him walk out. His family had had him involuntarily committed. The man hung himself in the jail cell. It was the first time the jail staff had ever lost someone like that.</p>\n<p>The mentally ill have lost lots in the last decade in Mississippi. Hospital beds. State employees devoted to care. Local crisis centers. Options of all kinds as state budgets have shrunk — first by the national financial crisis, then in a sustained series of state scale backs.</p>\n<p>The daughter-in-law of the woman Tyler stabbed had lost a brother to suicide. She had walked up to his house and saw him hanging there. He had a history of mental illness and self-harm. She had tried to get him help, trying to get him committed and begging local police officers to go check on him. She had a voicemail of him threatening suicide. He was 33 when he went ahead and did it.</p>\n<p>So, today, she mourns him, and helps cares for her mother-in-law, a casualty of a struggling system of care and justice.</p>\n<p>It didn’t shock me, then, when Bridgett, the camera-shy mother of Tyler, told me she, too, had been hospitalized for her own mental health problems.</p>\n<p>“It’s too late for me and Tyler,” she said to me more than once.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t honestly tell her otherwise.</p>\n<p>But maybe it’s not too late for others.</p>\n<p>Mississippi, the Calhoun County sheriff knows, is not alone in its problems. States across the country are failing the mentally ill, including those in their jails and prisons. It’s a shared shame. My story is an attempt to make better care a shared obligation.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7898049.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/justin-elliott\">Justin Elliott</a> </p>\n<p>The Justice Department is pushing for a question on citizenship to be added to the 2020 census, a move that observers say could depress participation by immigrants who fear that the government could use the information against them. That, in turn, could have potentially large ripple effects for everything the once-a-decade census determines — from how congressional seats are distributed around the country to where <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/working-papers/Uses-of-Census-Bureau-Data-in-Federal-Funds-Distribution.pdf\">hundreds of billions</a> of federal dollars are spent.</p>\n<p>The DOJ made the request in a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4340651-Text-of-Dec-2017-DOJ-letter-to-Census.html\">previously unreported letter</a>, dated Dec. 12 and obtained by ProPublica, from DOJ official <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-gary-41207b24/\">Arthur Gary</a> to the top official at the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department. The letter argues that the DOJ needs better citizenship data to better enforce the Voting Rights Act “and its important protections against racial discrimination in voting.”</p>\n<p>A Census Bureau spokesperson confirmed the agency received the letter and said the “request will go through the well-established process that any potential question would go through.” The DOJ declined to comment and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Observers said they feared adding a citizenship question would not only lower response rates, but also make the census more expensive and throw a wrench into the system with just two years to go before the 2020 count. Questions are usually carefully field-tested, a process that can take years.</p>\n<p>“This is a recipe for sabotaging the census,” said <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/bios/vargas-arturo.html\">Arturo Vargas</a>, a member of the National Advisory Committee of the Census and the executive director of NALEO Educational Fund, a Latino advocacy group. “When you start adding last-minute questions that are not tested — how will the public understand the question? How much will it suppress response rates?”</p>\n<p>The 2010 census included a handful of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/2010.html\">questions</a> covering age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, household relationship and owner/renter status — but not citizenship.</p>\n<p>“People are not going to come out to be counted because they’re going to be fearful the information would be used for negative purposes,” said <a href=\"http://teamsubjectmatter.com/team/steve-jost/\">Steve Jost</a>, a former top bureau official during the 2010 census. “This line about enforcing voting rights is a new and scary twist.” He noted that since the first census in 1790, the goal has been to count everyone in the country, not just citizens.</p>\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/white-house-proposal-to-ask-immigration-status-in-census-could-have-chilling-effect-experts-say/2017/02/01/1fc51b8e-e8af-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html?utm_term=.8a1c6a99a6ff\">rumblings</a> since the beginning of the year that the Trump administration wanted to add a citizenship question to the census. Adding to the concerns about the 2020 count, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/21/trump-census-pick-causes-alarm-252571\">reported</a> last month that the administration may appoint to a top job at the bureau a Republican redistricting expert who wrote a book called “Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America.” The Census Bureau’s population count <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment/about/faqs.html\">determines</a> how the 435 U.S. House seats are distributed.</p>\n<p>The law governing the census gives the commerce secretary, currently Wilbur Ross, the power to decide on questions. They must be submitted to Congress for review two years before the census, in this case by April 2018. A census spokesperson said the agency will also release the questions publicly at that time.</p>\n<p>A recent Census Bureau <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/cac/nac/meetings/2017-11/Meyers-NAC-Confidentiality-Presentation.pdf\">presentation</a> shows that the political climate is already having an effect on responsiveness to the bureau’s <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html\">American Community Survey</a>, which asks a more extensive list of questions, including on citizenship status, to about one in 38 households in the country per year. In one case, census interviewers reported, a respondent “walked out and left interviewer alone in home during citizenship questions.”</p>\n<p>“Three years ago, [it] was so much easier to get respondents compared to now because of the government changes … and trust factors. … Three years ago I didn’t have problems with the immigration questions,” said another census interviewer.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department <a href=\"http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/9499/v\">letter</a> argues that including a citizenship question on the once-a-decade census would allow the agency to better enforce <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act\">Section 2</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which bars the dilution of voting power of a minority group through redistricting.</p>\n<p>“To fully enforce those requirements, the Department needs a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population in localities where voting rights violations are alleged or suspected,” the letter states. The letter asks that the Census Bureau “reinstate” the question.</p>\n<p>The full census, however, hasn’t included questions about citizenship since 1950. The Census Bureau has gathered such data in other surveys. The bureau switched the method of those surveys after the 2000 census. Today, it conducts the American Community Survey every year, which includes questions about citizenship, along with many other questions. The survey covers a sample of residents of the United States.</p>\n<p>Experts said the Justice Department’s letter was misleading. And they questioned the Justice Department’s explanation in the letter, noting that the American Community Survey produces data on citizenship that has been used in Section 2 cases.</p>\n<p>“You could always have better data but it seems like a strange concern because no one in the communities who are most affected have been raising this concern,” said Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7888380.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/louise-kiernan\">Louise Kiernan</a> </p>\n<p>At ProPublica, one of our watchwords is transparency. We want you see how we do our work. That’s why we <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/datastore/\">publish the data</a> we use in our stories and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/reports/\">produce reports</a> three times a year detailing our projects and their impact. You can also check out our <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/propublica-FS-2016.pdf\">annual financial statements</a> on our website.</p>\n<p>Even so, in what is a particularly turbulent time for the press, many of us in journalism have come to realize the public doesn’t necessarily know as much about the way we go about our jobs as we may think.</p>\n<p>Investigative reporting is hard, time-consuming and painstaking. It comes with costs. Actual costs, of course, but costs in time and resources, too, that often remain invisible. So this week, I want to share with you a few examples of the work behind our work here at ProPublica Illinois.</p>\n<p>For her story about <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-youths-adult-prison\">juvenile offenders</a> receiving lengthy adult sentences for minor offenses, reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deldeib?lang=en\">Duaa Eldeib</a> pursued the Illinois Department of Corrections for weeks to win permission to interview inmates in the state’s prisons because she knew it was important to talk with them face to face. She made trips to a state prison and a county jail for the interviews. And she put 1,493 miles on her car to do it.</p>\n<p>One of the key figures in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mickeyd1971\">Mick Dumke’s</a> story about <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-chicago-gets-its-guns\">gun trafficking in Chicago</a> was a government informant we knew only by his first name: Yousef. Finding him so we could get his perspective — or at least let him know, in the interest of fairness, that we were writing about his case — involved scouring hundreds of pages of court records to find his full name. Then we went through online databases to try to find his contact information.</p>\n<p>Unable to reach him by phone or email, we spent hours driving to several suburbs to knock on the doors at homes where he and family members may have lived. Ultimately, we found and spoke with his wife and got a call from his attorney. Yousef didn't want to talk with us, but he appreciated our efforts to offer him the chance.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171229-illinois-newsletter-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171229-illinois-newsletter-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171229-illinois-newsletter-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171229-illinois-newsletter-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171229-illinois-newsletter-inline.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>This marked-up sheet of paper represents just a fraction of the extensive fact-checking that went into <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/the-tax-divide/cook-county-commercial-and-industrial-property-tax-assessments/\">Jason Grotto’s story</a> about the error-ridden commercial and industrial property assessments system in Cook County. Jason underlined and assigned a number to every fact in the 4,000-word article. Then he created a spreadsheet that included the fact number, a flag to indicate if it had been checked, a flag for any needed change to the fact, the source of the fact and a notes field for any other pertinent information about the fact. He did this for 291 facts. And then he went through and fact-checked the entire story again.</p>\n<p>Yes, just like Santa, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasongrotto?lang=en\">Jason</a> made a list and checked it twice.</p>\n<p>There are so many other examples of our “invisible costs’’ I could share with you — the 4,969 attorney names <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandhya__k?lang=en\">Sandhya Kambhampati</a> looked up on LinkedIn, the two months of repeated emails and calls it took <a href=\"https://twitter.com/msanchezMIA?lang=en\">Melissa Sanchez</a> to begin to get some government data she needed — but I think you get the idea. Precise, exhaustive — and sometimes tedious — work stands behind every one of our stories.</p>\n<p>We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished in the two and a half months we’ve been publishing at ProPublica Illinois and we’re excited about the work that’s to come. But we need your support to keep doing it. As a nonprofit newsroom, we rely on people like you — who know the value of independent journalism in Illinois — to provide our funding. As you plan your end-of-year giving, we hope you’ll consider <a href=\"https://donate.propublica.org/give/142344/#!/donation/checkout\">donating to us</a>. Your gift is tax-deductible, and you’ll be helping to power our stories in 2018.</p>\n<p>Happy new year,</p>\n<p>Louise Kiernan, ProPublica Illinois</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7882952.gif\" height=\"1\">",

So when ProPublica reader Holly West saw this graphic Facebook post declaring that “the only good Muslim is a fucking dead one,” she flagged it as hate speech using the social network’s reporting system.</p>\n<p>Facebook declared the photo to be acceptable. The company sent West an automated message stating: “We looked over the photo, and though it doesn’t go against one of our specific Community Standards, we understand that it may still be offensive to you and others.”</p>\n<p>But Facebook took down a terser anti-Muslim comment — a single line declaring “Death to the Muslims,” without an accompanying image — after users repeatedly reported it.</p>\n<p>Both posts were violations of Facebook’s policies against hate speech. But only one of them was caught by Facebook’s army of 7,500 censors — known as content reviewers — who decide whether to allow or remove posts flagged by its 2 billion users. After being contacted by ProPublica, Facebook also took down the one West complained about.</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Warning:</strong> This image contains offensive material.

Based on this small fraction of Facebook posts, its content reviewers often make different calls on items with similar content, and don’t always abide by the company’s complex guidelines. Even when they do follow the rules, racist or sexist language may survive scrutiny because it is not sufficiently derogatory or violent to meet Facebook’s definition of hate speech.</p>\n<p>We asked Facebook to explain its decisions on a sample of 49 items, sent in by people who maintained that content reviewers had erred, mostly by leaving hate speech up, or in a few instances by deleting legitimate expression. In 22 cases, Facebook said its reviewers had made a mistake. In 19, it defended the rulings. In six cases, Facebook said the content did violate its rules but its reviewers had not actually judged it one way or the other because users had not flagged it correctly, or the author had deleted it. In the other two cases, it said it didn’t have enough information to respond.</p>\n<p>“We’re sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build,” Facebook Vice President Justin Osofsky said in a statement. “We must do better.” He said Facebook will double the size of its safety and security team, which includes content reviewers and other employees, to 20,000 people in 2018, in an effort to enforce its rules better.</p>\n<p>He added that Facebook deletes about 66,000 posts reported as hate speech each week, but that not everything offensive qualifies as hate speech. “Our policies allow content that may be controversial and at times even distasteful, but it does not cross the line into hate speech,” he said. “This may include criticism of public figures, religions, professions, and political ideologies.”</p>\n<p>In several instances, Facebook ignored repeated requests by users to delete hateful content that violated its guidelines. At least a dozen people, as well as the Anti-Defamation League in 2012, lodged protests with Facebook to no avail about a page called Jewish Ritual Murder. However, after ProPublica asked Facebook about the page, it was taken down.</p>\n<p>Facebook’s guidelines are very literal in defining a hateful attack, which means that posts expressing bias against a specific group but lacking explicitly hostile or demeaning language often stay up, even if they use sarcasm, mockery or ridicule to convey the same message. Because Facebook tries to write policies that can be applied consistently across regions and cultures, its guidelines are sometimes blunter than it would like, a company spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Consider this photo of a black man missing a tooth and wearing a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket on his head. The caption states: ”Yeah, we needs to be spending dat money on food stamps wheres we can gets mo water melen an fried chicken.”</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Warning:</strong> This image contains offensive material.

When we asked for clarification, Facebook said the image and text were okay because they didn’t include a specific attack on a protected group.</p>\n<p>By comparison, a ProPublica reader, who asked not to be named, shared with us a post about race in which she expressed exasperation with racial inequality in America by saying, “White people are the fucking most.” Her comment was taken down by Facebook soon after it was published.</p>\n<p>How Facebook handles such speech is important because hate groups use the world’s largest social network to attract followers and organize demonstrations. After the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, this summer, CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to step up monitoring of posts celebrating “hate crimes or acts of terrorism.” Yet some activists for civil rights and women’s rights end up in “<a href=\"https://www.facebookjailed.com/\">Facebook jail</a>,” while pages run by groups listed as hateful by the Southern Poverty Law Center are decked out with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CANchristianactionnetwork/?fref=ts\">verification checkmarks and donation buttons</a>.</p>\n<p>In June, ProPublica reported on the secret rules that Facebook’s content reviewers use to decide which groups are “protected” from hate speech. We revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms\">rules protected “white men” but not “black children”</a> because “age,” unlike race and gender, was not a protected category. (In response to our article, Facebook added the category of “age” to its protected characteristics.) However, since subgroups are not protected, an attack on poor children, beautiful women, or Indian taxi cab drivers would still be considered acceptable.</p>\n<p>Facebook defines seven types of “attacks” that it considers hate speech: calls for exclusion, calls for violence, calls for segregation, degrading generalization, dismissing, cursing and slurs.</p>\n<p>For users who want to contest Facebook’s rulings, the company offers little recourse. Users can provide feedback on decisions they don’t like, but there is no formal appeals process.</p>\n<p>Of the hundreds of readers who submitted posts to ProPublica, only one said Facebook reversed a decision in response to feedback. Grammy-winning musician Janis Ian was banned from posting on Facebook for several days for violating community standards after she posted a photo of a man with a swastika tattooed on the back of his head — even though the text overlaid on the photo urged people to speak out against a Nazi rally. Facebook also removed the post.</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Warning:</strong> This image contains offensive material.

Shortly afterwards, the company reversed itself, restoring the post and Ian’s access. “A member of our team accidentally removed something you posted on Facebook,” it wrote to Ian. “This was a mistake, and we sincerely apologize for this error. We’ve since restored the content, and you should now be able to see it.”</p>\n<p>“Here’s the frustrating thing for me as someone who uses Facebook: when you try to find out what the community standards are, there’s no place to go. They change them willy-nilly whenever there’s controversy,” Ian said. “They’ve made themselves so inaccessible.”</p>\n<p>Without an appeals process, some Facebook users have banded together to flag the same offensive posts repeatedly, in the hope that a higher volume of reports will finally reach a sympathetic moderator. Annie Ramsey, a feminist activist, founded a group called “Double Standards” to mobilize members against disturbing speech about women. Members post egregious examples to the private group, such as this image of a woman in a shopping cart, as if she were merchandise.</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Warning:</strong> This image contains offensive material.

Ramsey’s group repeatedly complained about the image but was told it didn’t violate community standards.</p>\n<p>When we brought this example to Facebook, the company defended its decision. Although its rules prohibit content that depicts, celebrates or jokes about non-consensual sexual touching, Facebook said, this image did not contain enough context to demonstrate non-consensual sexual touching.</p>\n<p>Ramsey’s group had more luck with another picture of a woman in a shopping cart, this time with the caption, “Returned my defective sandwich-maker to Wal-Mart.” The group repeatedly flagged this post en masse, and eventually it got taken down. The difference may have been that the woman in this image was bloodied, suggesting she was the victim of a sexual assault.\nFacebook’s guidelines call for removing images that mock the victims of rape or non-consensual sexual touching, hate crimes or other serious physical injuries, the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Facebook said it takes steps to prevent mass reporting, a tactic used not only by “Double Standards” but by other advocacy groups, from influencing decisions. It uses automation to recognize duplicate reports, and caps the number of times it reviews a single post, according to a Facebook official.</p>\n<p>Members of Ramsey’s group have run afoul of Facebook’s rules for what they consider candid discussion of gender issues. Facebook took down a post by one member, Charro Sebring, which said, “Men really are trash.”</p>\n<p>Facebook defended its decision to remove what it called a “gender-based attack.”</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Warning:</strong> This image contains offensive material.

Her offense was reposting a suggestive image on another Facebook user’s page of a sleeping woman and a string of comments calling for rape. Ramsey added the caption: “Women don’t make memes or comments like this #NameTheProblem”</p>\n<p>Facebook restored Ramsey’s post after ProPublica brought it to the company’s attention. The content as a whole didn’t violate the guidelines because the caption attached to the photo condemned sexual violence, the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Facebook’s about-face didn’t mollify Ramsey. “They give you a little place to provide ‘feedback’ about your experience,” she said. “I give feedback every time in capital letters: YOU’RE BANNING THE WRONG PEOPLE.

      "summary": {
        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/marshall-allen\">Marshall Allen</a> </p>\n<p>In Maine, there’s a warehouse the size of a middle school gymnasium, stuffed with brand-new medical supplies and gently used medical equipment. Several pallets are piled with boxes of surgical sutures, still in their shrink wrap, each box worth hundreds of dollars. Tubs overflow with diabetes supplies and surgical instruments that may run hundreds of dollars apiece. There are bins of bandages and gauze and saline and ostomy bags and every other medical supply you can imagine. These materials, unexpired, could easily stock any hospital or clinic. But each item has actually been thrown away by a local medical facility.</p>\n<p>The cost of health care has been rising for decades, and Americans are paying the price. In a recent Gallup poll, people cited the high cost of care as their No. 1 financial concern. It’s an enormous problem, and trying to solve it all at once brings on panic and paralysis. But after reporting for a year on the ways the medical industry blows through our money, I have one idea: Let’s end the egregious waste that’s draining our health care system.</p>\n<p>The National Academy of Medicine has estimated the health care system wastes around $765 billion a year — about a quarter of what we spend. Eliminating all the waste could allow us to insure 150 million Americans, the Academy of Medicine said, and saving half of it could provide groceries for every household in the country for a year. Eliminating the waste would also stop our rising health care costs from eating up our wage increases. My premiums go up 9 percent next year. Same thing happened last year. Odds are your costs are rising, too.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to downplay what I found when I began investigating the issue. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/what-hospitals-waste\">Hospitals throw out so many valuable supplies</a> that a cottage industry of charities has sprung up to collect this stuff and ship it to the developing world — otherwise, all those goods in that Maine warehouse would be headed for a landfill.</p>\n<p>Nobody tracks how much hospitals waste rather than donate, and I couldn’t track down where each item came from. But experts told me when hospitals change vendors for a type of supply, they often toss the old stuff. Or, if they take over a clinic or facility, they get rid of the items that come with it, even if they are unused and unexpired.</p>\n<p>The operating room is a major source of wasted spending. One hospital tracked the value of unused items that went to waste during neurosurgery procedures in a single year. The total: $2.9 million — for one type of surgery at just one hospital. In that case, the surgeons hadn’t updated their system of telling the staff which supplies to prep for each operation. They were opening many items they didn’t need, which then had to be thrown away even though they were unused. The hospital updated its approach to make sure they aren’t setting up for operations with excess supplies.</p>\n<p>I learned that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/americas-other-drug-problem\">nursing homes throw away</a> hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of valuable medication every year. They typically dispense drugs a month at a time for patients and often have them discontinued if the patient dies or transfers. The excess drugs get trashed, incinerated or even flushed down the toilets, contaminating our water supply. The chief executive of a pharmacy that serves nursing homes in Florida told me that his company alone throws away about $2.5 million a year in valuable medication.</p>\n<p>In Iowa, the state government funded a program to recover these castoff nursing home meds and donate them to needy patients, for free. This year, they’re on pace to recover and redistribute $6 million in medication. My story led policymakers in Florida and New Hampshire to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/more-states-hatch-plans-to-recycle-drugs-being-wasted-in-nursing-homes\">introduce legislation</a> to try to replicate the Iowa program.</p>\n<p>Drugs are a huge source of waste, partly because <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myth-of-drug-expiration-dates\">drug expiration dates don’t mean what we think they mean</a>. The Food and Drug Administration makes pharmaceutical companies show their medication is safe and effective until its expiration date. It doesn’t make them find out how long they actually last.</p>\n<p>Studies show it’s common for a drug to be safe after its expiration date. The FDA runs a program that tests and then extends expiration dates on drugs in the federal government’s stockpiles. Those same drugs get thrown away in pharmacies when they “expire,” even though many of them are in short supply. How much of our money does it waste? One midsize hospital in Boston throws away about $200,000 worth of drugs a year that hit their expiration date. If that’s true for other hospitals, the total would be about $800 million a year for hospital pharmacies alone.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/drug-companies-make-eyedrops-too-big-and-you-pay-for-the-waste\">drug companies are making eyedrops</a> two or three times larger than what the eye can even contain. We are paying for the wasted medicine running down our cheeks. I spoke to the former head of research for Alcon Laboratories, a global leader in the eye care industry now owned by Novartis. He told me that in the early 1990s his team created a “microdrop” that eliminated the waste. The microdrops were effective and reduced the burning caused by larger drops. But Alcon’s leaders killed the project because they were worried it could reduce sales.</p>\n<p>Vials of cancer drugs are also made too large, which <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i788.full\">one study said wastes</a> about $1.8 billion a year in the valuable medication. Earlier this year, one drug company switched from a multiuse vial, which could be shared by patients, to a single-use vial that could not be shared, thereby increasing the amount of wasted cancer medication. The change would make the supply chain more reliable worldwide, the company said. But one cancer center calculated that the change would cost each patient an average of $1,000 in waste per infusion. Imagine: You’re fighting cancer and then get billed an extra thousand dollars for medication they toss in the trash. Two U.S. senators responded to my story by <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/senators-introduce-bill-to-reduce-colossal-and-completely-preventable-waste\">introducing legislation to solve the problem</a> of oversized eyedrops and cancer drug vials.</p>\n<p>These are not isolated examples or small sums being squandered. Let’s say my reporting identified about $10 billion in wasted spending. That’s a rough estimate because no one is actually tracking how much we’re wasting. What else could we be doing with that money? The Kaiser Family Foundation says it costs an average of $6,690 to pay one person’s insurance premium in 2017. At that rate, the $10 billion saved could insure about 1.5 million people for a year. Tell those people it isn’t important to reduce our wasted health care spending.</p>\n<p>The Academy of Medicine did something smart when it reframed our health care overspending as waste. We may be a wasteful country, but we still teach our kids to eat everything on their plates. “Waste not, want not,” is baked into our cultural DNA. It’s a powerful concept because it’s a moral one. It’s wrong to squander the hard-earned dollars Americans are paying into the health care system and then demand they pay more.</p>\n<p>We can’t be naive and think it will be easy to fix this problem. Our wasted spending represents revenue and profit for the medical industry. But our health care spending should not be an entitlement program for the medical industrial complex. I put together <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-prescription-for-reducing-wasted-health-care-spending\">a prescription for reducing the wasted spending</a> I identified. Our policymakers should stand up to the medical industry and stamp out the waste.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7873637.gif\" height=\"1\">",

That strength has come at a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/bombs-in-our-backyard\">largely unknown cost</a>. The testing and disposal of the nation's weapons here in the U.S. have poisoned drinking water supplies, rendered millions of acres of land unsafe or unusable, and jeopardized the health of often unwitting Americans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/l2StCpw8z-s\">Watch the video.</a></p>\n<p>ProPublica months ago began investigating the scope of the environmental problems caused by the U.S. military on domestic soil. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/military-pollution-open-burns-radford-virginia\">What we found</a> was arresting. The Pentagon has catalogued <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/bombs/\">more than 40,000 contaminated sites</a> across U.S. states and territories, and it has so far spent more than $40 billion attempting to clean them up. We have found no other single entity — corporation, government agency or individual — responsible for so much environmental degradation. The total amount of land contaminated by the military is larger than the state of Florida. Thousands of sites remain dangerously polluted and fenced off, awaiting the government's attention. Thousands of others have already been returned to public use — for parks, housing and schools — in some instances without thorough cleanups.</p>\n<p>Faced with these liabilities, the Pentagon has routinely sought to minimize its responsibility for fixing its environmental problems. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/military-pollution-open-burns-radford-virginia\">It burns hazardous waste</a> and explosives because it's the cheapest way to dispose of them, even though the burning process has been outlawed for most American industries since the 1980s. <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/military-pollution/military-pollution-contractors-scandal-toxic-cleanups/\">It employs contractors</a> to dispose of hazardous waste and clean up toxic sites, then claims it is not responsible when some of those contractors commit fraud, improperly handle toxic material, or cut corners on cleanups. It has in some cases explicitly refused to cooperate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and let dangerous sites linger unaddressed.</p>\n<p>But perhaps nothing better exemplifies the Pentagon's approach to its pollution problem than <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bombs-in-our-backyard/military-pollution-rdx-bombs-holston-cornhusker/\">the story of RDX</a>, one of the world's most powerful conventional explosives. RDX was developed by the U.S. military during World War II. It is now believed by many to cause cancer, and is increasingly turning up in drinking water supplies near military sites across the country. As the human health and environmental dangers of RDX have become known, ProPublica's investigation found that the Pentagon has resisted scientific evidence that it causes cancer, interfered with federal and state efforts to clean up RDX-contaminated lands, and even pressed Congress to re-write American environmental laws so as to not apply to RDX contamination.</p>\n<p>This story makes up the fourth installment in Vox's collaboration with ProPublica.

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/michael-grabell\">Michael Grabell</a> </p>\n<p>The first week Yongho Yeom worked on the chicken line at the House of Raeford poultry plant was like nothing he had ever imagined as a computer engineer in South Korea.</p>\n<p>Supervisors clocked him as he rapidly maneuvered scissors again and again to cut bones out of raw chicken thighs. The plant was cold to prevent spoilage. And the slaughtering of chickens created an awful stench.</p>\n<p>“It hurt a lot,” Yeom said. “All of the Korean workers, we all had some sort of chronic symptoms or pain, and some would lose their nails.”</p>\n<p>Yeom, now 46, had landed in South Carolina in 2015 after researching how to immigrate to the United States. At the time, he was living in Daejeon, a technology center about 90 miles south of Seoul and worried about the future of his two young daughters in Korea’s high-pressure education system, where many children spend additional hours each day in private “cram schools.” He also believed pollution blowing in from China was making him ill.</p>\n<p>Online, he came across the website of a Korean migration agency, which said <a href=\"http://www.houseofraeford.com\">House of Raeford</a>, a large chicken processor, was sponsoring foreign workers through a little-known green card program designed to fill unskilled jobs that U.S. employers say they can’t find American workers to do.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, ProPublica has documented how chicken plants and other low-wage industries rely heavily on <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/case-farms-chicken-industry-immigrant-workers-and-american-labor-law\">unauthorized immigrants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/low-wage-industries-immigrants-and-refugees\">refugees</a>, often mistreating them, and in some cases, using their immigration status to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/they-got-hurt-at-work-then-they-got-deported\">get rid of workers who are injured</a> or <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/exploitation-and-abuse-at-the-chicken-plant\">fight for better conditions</a>.</p>\n<p>In the last few years, the nation’s poultry companies have found yet another way to get cheap and willing labor to do the grueling work of processing tens of thousands of chicken carcasses each day for fast-food restaurants and supermarkets across the country.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the program, known by its category <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-third-preference-eb-3\">EB-3 (Other)</a>, could offer a lifeline for businesses facing legitimate labor shortages while providing a pathway to citizenship for unskilled immigrants. Companies that participate would need to show good-faith efforts to hire American-born workers first, improving wages and conditions in the process.</p>\n<p>But as the program has accelerated in recent years, it has been co-opted by a handful of companies and foreign consultants who have used it to bring in immigrants willing to work for low pay in often-dangerous jobs. In the U.S., the program is now dominated by a handful of poultry processors with poor safety records, one janitorial firm and a single fast-food franchisee. Overseas, a cottage industry of migration agents has popped up charging steep fees for “migration assistance,” even as the law bars the selling of green card sponsorship and other recruiting fees.</p>\n<p>And under the program, U.S. companies aren’t obligated to do much to first persuade Americans to take their jobs. They merely have to place two want ads seeking American workers in the local Sunday newspaper and a notice on the state jobs board — not raise pay or improve work conditions.</p>\n<p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Labor Department have increased scrutiny of the unskilled green card program over the past year. But even now, House Republicans are <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4092\">pushing a bill</a> that could help the meat and poultry industry bring in more than 10 times as many foreign workers a year with few of the protections provided by the green card program.</p>\n<p>The bill would expand another visa program for agricultural guest workers to meat and dairy processors, which usually can’t obtain guest workers because their jobs aren’t seasonal. Instead, it would let them hire the workers year-round. The pay would be below the prevailing wage in many areas. And workers’ legal status would be tied to their employers, preventing them from quitting to seek higher wages or better conditions.</p>\n<p>Unlike EB-3, guest worker programs for farmworkers (H-2A) and seasonal workers (H-2B), which are larger and receive more attention, do not provide a path to permanent residency or citizenship.</p>\n<p>The unskilled green card program has remained little known in part because from 2001 until 2013, it was virtually closed, with waits of six to eight years to get a visa. But that year, the backlog started to clear, spurring aggressive advertising in South Korea, China and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Demand is now so high that some foreign migration consultants have developed a lucrative niche charging between $20,000 and $130,000 for assistance accessing the jobs offered by employers in the program, which usually pay less than $20,000 a year. Turning the common immigration narrative upside down, the program often attracts middle-class professionals, such as engineers like Yeom and office workers, who are willing to take a steep fall down the economic ladder for the chance to raise their children in the U.S.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A trailer used for hauling live chickens from the farms outside the House of Raeford plant in West Columbia, South Carolina\n<span>(Dustin Chambers for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Like unauthorized immigrants, EB-3 immigrants are similarly compelled to accept poor work conditions, often having made a one-year commitment in exchange for the green card sponsorship.</p>\n<p>Jinhee Wilde, a Maryland immigration attorney, handles EB-3 cases for poultry processers like Case Farms, which was featured in an <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/case-farms-chicken-industry-immigrant-workers-and-american-labor-law\">earlier story</a> by ProPublica. The Labor Department has certified 568 foreign workers for Case Farms in the past three years.</p>\n<p>Wilde says the program serves a legitimate need and that sponsorship carries enough costs and hurdles that employers wouldn’t do it if they didn’t have to. Many new hires in jobs like chicken processing leave after a few weeks or even just a few days, she said, but EB-3 workers agree to serve a much longer stint.</p>\n<p>“Employers have a need for workers, whether unskilled work like chicken processing that no one wants to do it seems, or high-tech companies that need specialized skills,” she said. “Otherwise, the economy is going to come to a screeching halt.”</p>\n<p>Critics say poultry companies could attract U.S. workers if they improved safety, decreased line speeds and paid a living wage.</p>\n<p>“That’s why these jobs are so undesirable,” said Alex Galimberti, who leads the poultry worker campaign at Oxfam. “It is not surprising to me that some of the companies that are known as the lowest players in the industry, as far as working standards, are the same ones that are trying to take advantage of this visa program.”</p>\n<p>“To me,” he added, “this just looks like a scheme to keep standards low.”</p>\n<p>Beginning at the end of the Obama administration and accelerating under President Donald Trump, U.S. immigration agents and embassy officials have been clamping down on the program and increasing reviews of visa petitions, according to immigration attorneys, employers and foreign workers.</p>\n<p>ProPublica also found a severe slowdown in the processing of applications at the Labor Department, where the number of decisions for unskilled jobs has been cut in half while the denial rate has nearly doubled. The freeze was even more evident for poultry jobs, where about six out of 10 applications were denied — more than triple the rejection rate from the year before.</p>\n<p>A Labor Department spokesman said there has been no policy change under Trump, but couldn’t provide a reason for the slowdown. In response to questions, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Services pointed to recent comments made by the agency’s new director, L. Francis Cissna, who said that the new scrutiny of visas “reflects our commitment to protecting the integrity of the immigration system.”</p>\n<p>Wilde said immigration agents are questioning why white-collar Koreans would want to pay tens of thousands of dollars to cut chicken.</p>\n<p>“They are sacrificing themselves for the futures of their children,” she said. “That is no different than any other immigrants in American history.”</p>\n<p>Based in Rose Hill, North Carolina — home of the world’s largest frying pan — House of Raeford ranks among Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon as one of the biggest sponsors of green cards. The chicken processor, which employs 4,300 people at seven plants, has applied for 1,900 foreign workers in the last three years, according to Labor Department data. The company also ranks among the most dangerous poultry processors in the country, according to a ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/case-farms-chicken-industry-immigrant-workers-and-american-labor-law\">analysis</a> of safety violations, with many workers suffering crippling <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/special-reports/cruelest-cuts/article9012839.html\">hand injuries</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171228-chicken-plant-yeom-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171228-chicken-plant-yeom-2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171228-chicken-plant-yeom-2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171228-chicken-plant-yeom-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Yeom, 46, makes some repairs as he prepares for a health inspection for his new restaurant.

The rapid, repetitive motions were challenging, he said.</p>\n<p>Several former EB-3 workers interviewed for the story had similar experiences. While the work was abhorrent and sometimes humiliating, they were willing to endure it because they had received the opportunity to become permanent U.S. residents and potentially citizens.</p>\n<p>While the law doesn’t spell out how long immigrants have to stay with the sponsoring employer, some migration agents require workers to sign six-month or one-year contracts. Yeom said he didn’t have to, but still felt he had a duty to stick it out.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was a promise, so I decided to keep the promise, and also, I thought about all the other Korean workers who are trying to come to the U.S.,” he said, “because if I quit prematurely, I thought it might somehow disadvantage my fellow Korean people.”</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>About 54 percent of all immigrants who received green cards through the program in fiscal year 2016 were from South Korea. Another 16 percent came from China.</p>\n<p>The origins of the EB-3 program date back to the 1965 immigration act when Congress created a green card category for “skilled and unskilled workers in short supply.” Congress reorganized the immigration categories in 1990, but left a maximum of 5,000 green cards every year for jobs requiring no education and less than two years of training or experience.</p>\n<p>The program became increasingly popular with chicken plants and middle-class Koreans in the 1990s. But a 2000 law, which created a short window for people who entered illegally or overstayed visas to apply for permanent residence, led to a flood of applications that virtually closed the program in the 2000s through the early part of this decade.</p>\n<p>As the program began to reopen, migration agents in Korea, China and Vietnam saw an opportunity to advertise it as a fast track to the American dream, especially as fast-food franchisees began to seek workers for jobs at restaurants like Pizza Hut or Burger King.</p>\n<p>“Your chance to immigrate is at your fingertips,” says one ad posted on the website of a Vietnamese migration agency. “People who have visited the United States all praise, admire and sigh in exclamation at the never-ending green,” touts another in China. “There are trees, grass, flowers everywhere.” “Do not miss this opportunity!” “Only $70,000 and you can apply for a U.S. green card and give yourself and your family a beautiful future!”</p>\n<p>The law prohibits “the sale, barter or purchase” of labor certifications and requires employers to pay all fees associated with the applications. But the law leaves open fees related to “migration assistance,” such as explaining the different ways to immigrate to the United States, translating official paperwork and helping families get settled in a new country, said Wilde, the Maryland attorney.</p>\n<p>Some foreign migration agencies, whose websites were translated by ProPublica, play by the rules, simply offering information about visa requirements and the community, schools, cost of living and apartment rentals around the sponsoring employers.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-1.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-1.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-1.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-1.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171228-chicken-plant-inline-1.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A House of Raeford chicken plant in West Columbia, South Carolina.

He would come home from the chicken plant at 8 a.m., massage his hands with warm water, eat breakfast and go to the fish market, where he worked from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Then he’d return home, spend time with his kids and sleep for four to five hours before getting up for his midnight job at House of Raeford.</p>\n<p>After 13 months at the chicken plant, Yeom quit and worked full time at the fish market.

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/annie-waldman\">Annie Waldman</a> </p>\n<p>NEW YORK — When Dacheca Fleurimond decided to give birth at SUNY Downstate Medical Center earlier this year, her sister tried to talk her out of it.</p>\n<p>Her sister had recently delivered at a better-rated hospital in Brooklyn’s gentrified Park Slope neighborhood and urged Fleurimond, a 33-year-old home health aide, to do the same.</p>\n<p>But Fleurimond had given birth to all five of her other children at the state-run SUNY Downstate and never had a bad experience. She and her family had lived steps away from the hospital in East Flatbush when they emigrated from Haiti years ago. She knew the nurses at SUNY Downstate, she told her sister. She felt comfortable there.</p>\n<p>She didn’t know then how much rode on her decision, or how fraught with risk her delivery would turn out to be.</p>\n<p>It’s been long-established that black women like Fleurimond fare worse in pregnancy and childbirth, dying at a rate <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm\">more than triple</a> that of white mothers. And while part of the disparity can be attributed to factors like poverty and inadequate access to health care, there is growing evidence that points to the quality of care at hospitals where a disproportionate number of black women deliver, which are often in neighborhoods disadvantaged by segregation.</p>\n<p>Researchers have found that women who deliver at these so-called “black-serving” hospitals are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909341\">more likely</a> to have serious complications — from infections to birth-related embolisms to emergency hysterectomies — than mothers who deliver at institutions that serve fewer black women.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s difficult to tell from studies alone how this pattern plays out in real life. The hospitals are never named. The women behind the numbers are faceless, the specific ways their hospitals may have failed them unknown.</p>\n<p>ProPublica did its own analysis, using two years of hospital inpatient discharge data from New York, Illinois and Florida to look in-depth at how well different facilities treat women who experience one particular problem — hemorrhages — while giving birth.</p>\n<p>We, too, found the same broad pattern identified in previous studies — that women who hemorrhage at disproportionately black-serving hospitals are far more likely to wind up with severe complications, from hysterectomies, which are more directly related to hemorrhage, to pulmonary embolisms, which can be indirectly related. When we looked at data for only the most healthy women, and for white women at black-serving hospitals, the pattern persisted.</p>\n<p>Beyond this bird’s-eye view, our analysis allowed us to identify individual hospitals with higher complication rates, to look at what kinds of protocols they have and to examine what went wrong in specific cases.</p>\n<p>We found, for example, that SUNY Downstate, where 90 percent of the women who give birth are black, has one of the highest complication rates for hemorrhage across all three states. On average, 34 percent of women who hemorrhage while giving birth at New York hospitals experience significant complications. At SUNY Downstate, it’s 62 percent.</p>\n<p>SUNY Downstate officials defended the hospital’s handling of obstetric hemorrhages, saying it has extensive protocols for responding to them and gets exemplary results despite handling deliveries involving mothers with higher-than-average numbers of health problems like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. They would not comment on Fleurimond’s case, citing patient privacy.</p>\n<p>Fleurimond was admitted to Downstate on Aug. 9.</p>\n<p>Pregnant with twins, her doctor noticed she was in preterm labor at her 34-week checkup and prepped her for an unplanned cesarean section. When they cut into her womb to deliver the babies, Fleurimond’s uterus didn’t fully contract as it should have. She began to bleed. By the time the doctors controlled the hemorrhage, she had lost more than a liter of blood, requiring two transfusions.</p>\n<p>At first, it seemed she’d be fine. She awoke the following morning thinking the worst was over, eager to see her new sons.</p>\n<p>She wouldn’t survive the day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every year in the United States, between 700 and 900 women die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. For every woman that dies, dozens more <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/severe-complications-for-women-during-childbirth-are-skyrocketing-and-could-often-be-prevented\">experience</a> severe complications, which affect more than 50,000 women annually.</p>\n<p>The U.S. rate of maternal mortality is substantially higher than those of other affluent nations and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/health/maternal-mortality.html\">risen</a> over the past decade. Outcomes for black women have led the way, intensifying efforts by medical experts and academics to understand what’s driving the racial disparity.</p>\n<p>A complicating factor in understanding how hospital care figures in is that hospitals take on different proportions of tough cases — patients who have less <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10979253\">access</a> to consistent, quality prenatal care or have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1781382/#r24\">chronic health issues</a>, like diabetes or heart disease, that make pregnancy and childbirth riskier.</p>\n<p>Some prominent researchers are using a methodology for analyzing birth outcomes that attempts to even the playing field.</p>\n<p>The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, which <a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/\">studies</a> maternal deaths and develops techniques to prevent them, looks at how well hospitals respond to obstetric hemorrhage, typically defined as losing more than 500 milliliters of blood during a vaginal birth or a liter of blood during a cesarean section. Why hemorrhages? Because women of all races experience them at roughly the same rates and their likelihood is less affected by factors like race or economic status, said CMQCC medical director Dr. Elliott Main.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read the Methodology</h3>\n<div>\n\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-measured-birth-complications\">How We Measured Birth Complications</a></h3>\n<h4>Here’s the methodology for our analysis of birth complication rates.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>CMQCC evaluates hospitals by calculating what percent of women who hemorrhage during birth wind up with major complications. Researchers count both the complications more directly related to hemorrhages, like hysterectomies and blood transfusions, and those that could be indirectly related, including embolisms, blood clots, heart attacks, kidney failure, respiratory distress, aneurysms, brain bleeds, sepsis and shock. Ultimately, this approach measures how often doctors prevent complications when a hemorrhage occurs, and when looked at over time, can show if a hospital has been able to improve.</p>\n<p>ProPublica used the metric to analyze inpatient hospital discharge data collected by New York, Illinois and Florida for 2014 and 2015, examining all obstetric cases that were coded as involving hemorrhages — about 67,000 cases in all.</p>\n<p>We also put each hospital into a category based on the concentration of black mothers who gave birth there, defining facilities as low, medium or high black-serving. We crafted our analysis so that it reflected the racial distribution of mothers delivering in each state. In New York, if black mothers represented roughly a third or more of the deliveries at a hospital, we considered the hospital high black-serving. In Florida, we considered a hospital high black-serving if about 40 percent of the mothers were black. In Illinois, we considered a hospital high black-serving if at least half of its mothers were black.</p>\n<p>In New York, we defined a hospital as low black-serving if less than eight percent of the women delivering there were black. In Illinois, the cutoff was 14 percent. In Florida, it was 18 percent.</p>\n<p>Across the three states, about one in 10 hospitals in our analysis was high black-serving — in some cases, extremely high. Ninety-nine percent of the mothers who gave birth at Jackson Park Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago were black.</p>\n<p>While a handful of low black-serving hospitals had high complication rates, our analysis found that, on average, outcomes at hospitals that served a high number of black patients were far worse.</p>\n<p>In New York, on average, high black-serving hospitals had complication rates 21 percent higher than low black-serving hospitals. In Illinois and Florida, high black-serving hospitals had complication rates 11 percent higher.</p>\n<p>When we limited our patient pool to only mothers of average birthing age — between 25 and 32 — who did not have any chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, the pattern remained largely the same. This bolstered the notion that differences in care, along with patient characteristics, affected outcomes.</p>\n<p>Deeper analysis of the data for each state underlined this finding. At low black-serving hospitals in New York, just under a third of the women who hemorrhaged had complications. At high black-serving hospitals, that rate climbed to about half.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-dacheca-inline-new.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171227-dacheca-inline-new.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171227-dacheca-inline-new.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-dacheca-inline-new.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Fleurimond, a 33-year old home health aide and mother of seven, died a day after delivering her twin sons at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, New York.\n<span>(Courtesy of the Fleurimond family)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Dr. Elizabeth Howell, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, has taken a more refined look at racial disparities among New York City’s hospitals. She <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26283457\">found</a> black mothers were twice as likely to suffer harm when delivering babies than white mothers, even after adjusting for patients’ differing characteristics, suggesting that some of the racial disparity may be due to hospital quality. In a separate study, she estimated that the rate of harm for black women would <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179441\">fall</a> by nearly 50 percent if they gave birth at the same hospitals as white women.</p>\n<p>She’s also considered the same dynamic nationally. Because three quarters of black mothers <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26283457\">deliver</a> in about a quarter of the country’s hospitals, Howell believes that racial disparities could be reduced if hospitals that disproportionately serve black women improved their care.</p>\n<p>There is clear evidence hospitals can make such improvements.</p>\n<p>In California, complications related to obstetric hemorrhage decreased by about 20 percent in hospitals that adopted <a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/sites/default/files/Main%20etal%20SMM%20HEM%20at%20SMFM%20copy.pdf\">protocols</a> promoted by Main’s group, which include keeping carts stocked with supplies to stave off massive bleeding and holding drills to simulate severe hemorrhage events. “It creates improvement in the team, increases communication and improves your response to all emergencies,” Main said.</p>\n<p>Still, Main’s protocols haven’t been universally adopted in California, let alone elsewhere in the U.S., and many hospitals go their own way.</p>\n<p>The spokesperson for SUNY Downstate — where more than 14 percent of women hemorrhage during birth, an average of one mother every other day — said the hospital “has already developed their own ‘best practice’ <a href=\"https://www.downstate.edu/regulatory/pdf/policies/OBGYN-06.pdf\">protocols</a> for hemorrhage that other hospitals should be following.” These include a special “Code Mom” that details steps doctors and nurses need to take when responding to a hemorrhage. And women with placental problems are monitored by ultrasound, so that doctors can anticipate the most complex cases before beginning cesarean surgeries.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>According to public documents posted in an online <a href=\"https://www.downstate.edu/regulatory/pdf/policies/\">repository</a> of the hospital’s policies, the obstetric and gynecology department’s <a href=\"https://www.downstate.edu/regulatory/pdf/policies/OBGYN-06.pdf\">emergency response policy on hemorrhage</a> does not explicitly follow some of Main’s recommendations, such as having pre-fab kits to respond to hemorrhages and doing staff drills to prepare for them. SUNY Downstate did not respond to questions about these differences.</p>\n<p>Dr. Ovadia Abulafia, the chair of the hospital’s department of obstetrics and gynecology, noted that SUNY Downstate serves a particularly “underserved” and “high-risk” population. More than 80 percent of women who deliver there are obese, a spokesperson said, and the hospital sees a higher incidence of diabetes, blood pressure disorders and placental separation problems compared to the rest of the nation.</p>\n<p>But Dr. Allison Bryant Mantha, a high-risk obstetrician and health care disparities researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, said hospitals shouldn’t use demographics or patient characteristics to excuse poor outcomes. Instead, they should hone their practices to deliver the care their patients need.</p>\n<p>“Hospitals have to own the conditions that women walk in with,” Bryant said. “You have to give patients what they need to get to a quality level of care. We are doing a good job of equal care, but not adjusting for needs.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-berlynda-twins-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171227-berlynda-twins-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171227-berlynda-twins-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171227-berlynda-twins-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-berlynda-twins-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Berlynda holds Kayden and Jayden as her other brother Aiden, 2, plays next to her.

Her biggest concern that afternoon was what she was going to eat. “What is Jell-O going to do for me?” she complained to her sister Merline Lamy, who responded, “This is your two-day diet, baby girl.” Fleurimond rolled her eyes.</p>\n<p>She might not have felt it at the moment, but Fleurimond was still at risk of serious complications related to her hemorrhage, including pulmonary embolism, typically caused when a blood clot travels from a patient’s leg to a lung artery, blocking blood flow to the lungs.</p>\n<p>Her blood was already predisposed to clotting, a biological mechanism that likely <a href=\"http://asheducationbook.hematologylibrary.org/content/2009/1/277.full\">evolved</a> in pregnant women to prevent hemorrhage during birth. Carrying twins can put extra pressure on the vessels around the uterus, further <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629711/\">constricting</a> blood flow. The cesarean surgery, like all surgeries, substantially <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20161004/c-section-raises-risk-of-blood-clots-after-childbirth-review#1\">increased</a> her risk, as did the transfusions.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Fleurimond weighed 260 pounds and was being treated for high blood pressure.</p>\n<p>To prevent clotting, nurses had put compression boots on her legs. Just after 3 p.m., according to family members who were visiting Fleurimond, a nurse unfastened the boots, helped Fleurimond into a wheelchair and took her to visit the twins, Jayden and Kayden, in the neonatal intensive care unit. She’d held them only briefly in the operating room and craved another look. They had her round cheeks, which shone like polished apples.</p>\n<p>Experts say compression boots lose their deterrent effect about 15 minutes after they are removed. Fleurimond spent about 90 minutes in the NICU with her aunt, who recalled her sitting in her wheelchair the whole time, her legs hanging down. Shortly after her aunt left, she complained that she felt unwell, but three hospital employees who spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity say that she waited at least 40 minutes for a transport aide to wheel her back to her room. There is no evidence in her medical record that anyone came to assess her when she returned.</p>\n<p>Doctors also did not prescribe heparin, a blood-thinning medicine being used at other hospitals to prevent pulmonary embolism in mothers with high risk factors, for whom compression boots are unlikely to be enough.</p>\n<p>In the United Kingdom, protocols that advocate more aggressive use of blood thinners, particularly after C-sections, helped reduce embolism deaths by more than half within three years.</p>\n<p>In the United States, a chorus of <a href=\"http://excellence.acforum.org/sites/default/files/Obstretric%20guidelines%20for%20VTE%20ppx%202016.pdf\">medical trade</a> groups and <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/-/media/Districts/District-II/Public/SMI/v2/VTESlideSetNov2015Update052317.pdf?dmc=1&ts=20171210T2054550598\">maternal safety</a> organizations have begun to promote more widespread use of blood thinners during pregnancy and childbirth, but not all hospitals have made it their practice.</p>\n<p>“There are some experts who feel that it’s not worth the time, trouble and cost to avoid relatively rare events,” said Dr. Alexander Friedman, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-duo-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171227-duo-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171227-duo-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171227-duo-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-duo-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Left: Dacheca’s son Joshua, 9, does his math homework on his own.

Three miles away from Downstate, at a Brooklyn hospital that has a smaller concentration of black patients and a lower complication rate related to hemorrhages, Maimonides Medical Center gives blood thinners to nearly all of mothers who undergo cesarean sections or have other risk factors.</p>\n<p>Friedman, who reviewed Fleurimond’s medical records at ProPublica’s request, said she should’ve received the drug.</p>\n<p>Dr. Douglas Montgomery, an obstetrician-gynecologist and director of the Maternal Fetal Medicine Department at California’s Kaiser Permanente Riverside Medical Center, said he would prescribe the drug to any patient who had Fleurimond’s risk factors.</p>\n<p>At around 6 p.m., Fleurimond called the father of her twins. She sounded short of breath. She said she was in pain and asked him to come to the hospital, then hung up and waited, alone.</p>\n<p>At about 6:25 p.m., Fleurimond screamed, medical records show. A doctor and nurse entered her room and found her gasping for air. More responders came. They couldn’t find a pulse. After more than an hour of resuscitation attempts, she was pronounced dead at 7:45 p.m.</p>\n<p>Because Fleurimond died “during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or from complications of such procedures,” as Downstate’s <a href=\"https://www.downstate.edu/pnp/lab/autopsy_service.html#B\">website</a> puts it, she was referred to the New York City medical examiner’s office for an autopsy. Her cause of death, according to the autopsy report: pulmonary embolism, also known as “venous thromboembolism,” a condition that <a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/qi-initiatives/venous-thromboembolism-pregnancy-and-postpartum\">almost always</a> has a chance of being prevented.</p>\n<p>In an emailed statement, Abulafia said SUNY Downstate “follows the proven [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists] protocols for obstetric hemorrhage, severe hypertension and venous thromboembolism.” SUNY Downstate has not had a maternal death related to hemorrhage in the past 15 years, a spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Such assurances provide little solace to Fleurimond’s relatives, who have sought an attorney to represent them.</p>\n<p>“Dacheca Fleurimond was clearly at high risk to have a blood clot and there weren’t adequate preventative measures,” said the attorney, Eleni Coffinas. “The obesity, the hypertension, and the fact that she hemorrhaged after her C-section were all high-risk factors and she needed to be monitored for that.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>New York City occupies a unique place in the discussion of racial disparities in maternal mortality as both a hub of groundbreaking research on the subject and one of the nation’s starkest examples of such gaps.</p>\n<p>In addition to the work by Howell, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has published a couple of reports, including one documenting how, as the mortality rate of expectant and new mothers overall across the city has dropped, the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ms/pregnancy-associated-mortality-report.pdf\">disparity</a> between black and white mothers has grown.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<div>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/black-women-disproportionately-suffer-complications-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-lets-talk-about-it\">\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171208-black-maternal-health-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171208-black-maternal-health-3x2.jpg 1200w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-3x2.jpg\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/black-women-disproportionately-suffer-complications-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-lets-talk-about-it\">Black Women Disproportionately Suffer Complications of Pregnancy and Childbirth. Let’s Talk About It.</a></h3>\n<h4>We started with 10 women who faced six different maternal complications.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>Even when accounting for risk factors like low educational attainment, obesity and neighborhood poverty level, the city’s black mothers still face significantly higher rates of <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf\">harm</a>, the agency found. Of note, black mothers who are college-educated fare worse than women of all other races who never finished high school. Obese women of all races do better than black women who are of normal weight. And black women in the wealthiest neighborhoods do worse than white, Hispanic and Asian mothers in the poorest ones.</p>\n<p>The health department has even mapped where the most maternal harm occurs, dividing the city into community districts. The highest rates of complications are concentrated in a swath of land in Central Brooklyn, in an area largely untouched by the wave of gentrification that has swept other parts of the borough. Here, mothers face up to four times the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf\">complication</a> rates of neighborhoods just a few subway stops away. Fleurimond lived in one such danger zone, in a public housing development in eastern Crown Heights.</p>\n<p>At three medical centers in this area that deliver babies — Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Kings County Hospital and SUNY Downstate — more than half of mothers who hemorrhaged during delivery experienced complications, ProPublica’s data analysis shows. More than three quarters of the women who give birth at Brookdale are black, as are nearly 90 percent of the women who deliver at Kings County Hospital.</p>\n<p>Officials at Brookdale, a private nonprofit hospital, would not respond to questions from ProPublica. The New York City Health + Hospitals Corporation, the public benefit organization that operates Kings County Hospital, gave a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329994-NYC-HCC-Obstetric-Protocols-Response.html\">detailed response</a> laying out its protocols for obstetric hemorrhages, including some recommended by Main’s group. Robert de Luna, a spokesperson for the city’s hospital operator, said in an email that while hemorrhage is a good proxy indicator for maternal harm, “some of our patients come from all over the world (self-referred), a good number coming to us too late to benefit from our prenatal care services.” (Read the full <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334345-Responses-to-ProPublica-Questions-From-Robert-De.html\">response</a> here.)</p>\n<p>Some of the women who deliver at these hospitals are well aware of their reputations.</p>\n<p>Brookdale, for example, was recently rated an ‘F’ by Leapfrog, the health care quality and safety nonprofit, one of only 15 hospitals in the country to receive a failing grade.</p>\n<p>But proximity sometimes takes precedence over choice. That was the case for Merowe Nubyahn, a 37-year-old hospice aide.</p>\n<p>In March 2013, when Nubyahn was 24 weeks pregnant, she was overcome with intense nausea and vomiting, and unexpectedly, her water broke. When emergency medical technicians arrived at her East New York apartment, she begged them to take her anywhere but Brookdale. She hadn’t liked what she had heard about the hospital and had been getting her prenatal care elsewhere. The ambulance took her to Brookdale anyway because it was closest.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-merowe-portrait-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171227-merowe-portrait-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171227-merowe-portrait-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-merowe-portrait-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Merowe Nubyahn lost her baby while delivering at Brookdale Hospital, which has one of the highest complication rates in the city.\n<span>(Sara Lewkowicz, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>At the hospital, she was rushed in for a cesarean section. Her daughter, delivered at what’s considered the edge of viability, barely clung to life in the hospital’s NICU. When Nubyahn awoke in the recovery room, layers of gauze covered her belly and her throat felt like sandpaper. Disoriented, she said she asked a nurse what had happened, but the words felt garbled leaving her mouth. Two of her teeth had been knocked out when she was intubated for anesthesia, according to her medical records. Nubyahn recalled that when she asked the doctor about them, he gave her an incredulous look and asked, “Are you sure you had teeth when you came in here?”</p>\n<p>A bigger threat to her health emerged the morning after she was discharged from the hospital. As she sat in bed, she says she felt sharp cramping pains and a warm, viscous feeling. She looked down at her belly and saw dark, clotted blood — “plums and prunes” — bursting out of her cesarean incision.</p>\n<p>Her wound had become infected — a common complication — and had begun to come apart. Still wearing her hospital bracelet, she was shuttled back to Brookdale and told she’d also developed a hematoma, a mass of blood, around her incision site.</p>\n<p>While Nubyahn was being treated in one part of the hospital for her various complications, her baby died in another. Overcome with grief and stung by her treatment, Nubyahn checked herself out and vowed to never return. “All the horror stories that I have heard about Brookdale … I totally have my own now,” she said.</p>\n<p>Khari Edwards, the vice president of external affairs at Brookdale, said the hospital would not comment on Nubyahn’s case due to privacy laws.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that hospitals in Central Brooklyn have some of the highest maternal complication rates in the city, the health department has begun to target the area with services in recent years. It supports the <a href=\"https://www.bkreader.com/2017/01/side-birth-support-alternative-maternal-care-brooklyn-moms/\">By My Side</a> initiative that pairs up women with doulas who can advocate for them during birth. The department also supports <a href=\"https://www.bkreader.com/2016/02/central-brooklyn-clinics-become-first-in-borough-initiate-centeringpregnancy-model/\">prenatal programs</a> in the area based on a model of assessment, education and support, also known as CenteringPregnancy.</p>\n<p>“We are data driven and we look to where the outcomes are the worst,” said Dr. Deborah Kaplan, the assistant commissioner for maternal, infant and reproductive health at the department.</p>\n<p>This month, the city convened a new <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/new-york-city-launches-committee-to-review-maternal-deaths\">committee</a> to review deaths and severe complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. One of its priorities will be to figure out why — despite years of research and attention — the city’s racial disparities have persisted and even grown.</p>\n<p>“We used to say we are not sure why we are seeing these racial disparities. Now we say unequivocally that racism causes these problems,” said Kaplan. She emphasized that this encompassed not only health care but all aspects of life in the city, from housing to schools. “If we provide equally to everyone, we could widen the inequity. We have to prioritize putting resources in neighborhoods with the highest rates of severe maternal morbidity and the least access.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-tanesia-portrait-new.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171227-tanesia-portrait-new.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171227-tanesia-portrait-new.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171227-tanesia-portrait-new.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171227-tanesia-portrait-new.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Tanesia Walker was already a mother to Tafari, nearly 2, when she died after giving birth to her second son, Tyre.\n<span>(Sara Lewkowicz, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Just three months after Fleurimond died at SUNY Downstate, another black woman died there, hours after giving birth.</p>\n<p>Tanesia Walker, a 31-year-old flight attendant, had originally planned to deliver at New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, where she had her first son. But a week before her scheduled cesarean, her doctor changed her delivery to Downstate, where he also had privileges.</p>\n<p>Walker grew nervous after reading negative reviews of the hospital online, family members said. They tried to calm her down. Hers was not a high-risk pregnancy, they reminded her. She wasn’t overweight and her blood pressure was fine.</p>\n<p>Walker seemed okay after a C-section at SUNY Downstate on Nov. 27, holding her newborn son Tyre close to her chest as her family spent the afternoon with her. Then, at 2 a.m., she sent a text message to her fiancé saying she had a pain in her side, he told ProPublica.</p>\n<p>A few hours later, she was dead.</p>\n<p>As family members trickled into the hospital that morning, shocked and confused, doctors couldn’t say why she died, said her father Junior Walker.

As with Fleurimond, the city medical examiner’s office has done an autopsy, but has not yet released its report.</p>\n<p>Walker’s death haunts her younger brother Dwayne, who kept in touch with her nonstop as she traveled.

He billed for 4,765 such high-level visits that year, <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/doctors/1275565442\">according to federal data</a>, more than any other doctor in the country. And for that, he collected nearly $450,000 from Medicare.</p>\n<p>Roberts’ billing pattern was highly unusual compared to his peers. All told, family medicine doctors in Alabama billed for such visits only 5 percent of the time. Roberts did so 95 percent of the time. Even some doctors who had sicker patients billed for top-level visits less often, Medicare data show. Several messages left at Roberts’ office were not returned.</p>\n<p>For years, internal government watchdogs have been <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00180.pdf\">warning the federal Medicare program</a> that some doctors were overcharging for office visits. And for years, federal health officials have been promising to focus on the problem.</p>\n<p>But a new ProPublica analysis shows very little has changed since we <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/billing-to-the-max-docs-charge-medicare-top-rate-for-office-visits\">first wrote about the issue</a> in 2014. ProPublica found that 1,825 health professionals, including Roberts, billed Medicare for the most expensive type of office visits for established patients at least 90 percent of the time in 2015. That was almost the same as the 1,807 that we found based on 2012 data. Some physicians that were billing Medicare this way in 2012 still were in 2015, we found.</p>\n<p>Office visits are a staple of medicine. In 2016, Medicare paid for more than 227 million of them at a cost of $13.2 billion (including Medicare outlays and patient copayments). They are far from the most expensive services that Medicare provides, but they are ubiquitous.</p>\n<p>While it’s possible that some physicians only treat the sickest patients who require the highest level office visits, “I don’t think it’s very probable,” said Dwayne Grant, regional inspector general for evaluation and inspections for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Atlanta. Grant’s team produced reports in <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00180.pdf\">2012</a> and <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00181.asp\">2014</a> that said Medicare needed to do more to address improper billing.</p>\n<p>“We continue to believe that focusing on these high-coding physicians is going to improve oversight, reduce overpayments and really serve as a deterrent effect,” he said.</p>\n<p>Among the 1,825 physicians who billed most often for complex office visits was <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/doctors/1972535979\">Dr. Jose Prieto</a>, an internist in Hialeah, Florida. He billed for 721 office visits in 2015, all of them at the highest level, Medicare data show. Medicare revoked Prieto’s ability to participate in the program in December 2016 for “falsified information,” according to data provided under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p>Prieto did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment. A woman who returned a call placed to his office said Prieto is an infectious disease doctor who treats patients with HIV and routinely spends 45 minutes with each patient. The woman disputed that Prieto exclusively bills for the highest level office visits, as Medicare data shows. “He bills for the time he spends with his patients,” she said.</p>\n<p>Another is Dr. <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/doctors/1316934409\">James Beale</a>, an orthopedic surgeon in Warren, Michigan. All 1,150 of his Medicare office visits were billed at the highest level in 2015. Beale has been <a href=\"https://w2.lara.state.mi.us/VAL/License/Details/84433\">disciplined three times</a> by Michigan’s medical board, most recently in May 2016 when <a href=\"https://w2.lara.state.mi.us/VAL/Files/ViewDocument/33293\">he was suspended</a> for failing to respond to a <a href=\"https://w2.lara.state.mi.us/VAL/Files/ViewDocument/33292\">2015 board complaint</a> that he prescribed controlled substances for patients without adequate justification. Beale also extensively billed Medicare for psychotherapy services in 2015. He could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Also on the list is Dr. <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/doctors/1851325484\">Rand Ritchie</a>, a Pismo Beach, California, psychiatrist. He billed 1,475 visits at the highest level, or 97 percent of his Medicare office visits, in 2015. The California medical board has disciplined Ritchie twice for <a href=\"http://www2.mbc.ca.gov/BreezePDL/document.aspx?path=%5cDIDOCS%5c20120904%5cDMRAAAEC1%5c&did=AAAEC120904155907965.DID\">alcohol abuse and multiple convictions</a> for driving under the influence of alcohol. He <a href=\"https://search.dca.ca.gov/details/8002/G/41327/8908cef71b792cfbf40938504936cedf#pr\">completed probation most recently in 2014</a> and currently has an unrestricted license.</p>\n<p>Ritchie’s office manager, Darryl Schumacher, who handles billing for the practice, said Ritchie had started accepting Medicare around 2015 because no other psychiatrists in private practice in the area did so. “He was taking on many new patients and the complexity of some of these patients, because they had either gone without treatment for many years or had gone without a psychiatrist, was pretty difficult at the beginning,” Schumacher said.</p>\n<p>Schumacher also said that no one from Medicare had contacted the practice to ask about Ritchie’s numbers and that questions from ProPublica were the first indication that his billing pattern was unlike that of his peers. As for his discipline, Schumacher said Ritchie fulfilled the requirements of his probation and is once again board certified in psychiatry.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency is exploring how to make changes to its billing rules for office visits to reduce the burden on doctors and better reflect the way medicine is practiced and care is coordinated.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-11-15/pdf/2017-23953.pdf\">notice in the Federal Register</a> in November, CMS said the guidelines governing how health professionals bill for office visits, more formally called Evaluation and Management visits, date to 1995 and 1997. CMS said the process for updating them could take several years.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, doctors and their staffs decide how to bill for a patient visit based on a host of factors, including how thoroughly they review a patient’s medical history, the intensity of the physical exam and how complicated the medical decision-making was. The coding system developed by the American Medical Association gives doctors five options.</p>\n<p>An uncomplicated visit, typically of short duration and which may not require a physician, is coded a “1”; a visit that involves more intense examination and often consumes more time is coded a “5.” The most common codes for visits are in the middle, “3” and “4.”</p>\n<p>Most health professionals had a tiny percentage, if any, visits billed at level 5, but more than 1,250 billed only at the highest level in 2015, ProPublica found. Another 570 billed that way more than 90 percent of the time. That was very similar to what we found three years earlier.</p>\n<p>Cyndee Weston, executive director of the American Medical Billing Association, an industry trade group, said such numbers raise red flags. “It’s not likely that every patient that comes to a doctor’s office is a level 5,” she said.</p>\n<p>The doctors who billed at the top level in 2015 were not all the same as those who did so in 2012. Of the 1,825, 650 were on the list in both years. Another 536 billed for a lesser share of visits at the highest level in 2012. And the remaining health providers did not bill Medicare in 2012 for office visits involving at least 11 patients.</p>\n<p>For some doctors, the shift was jarring.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Roberts, the Evergreen, Alabama, family doctor, never billed for high-level office visits. He billed Medicare 4,681 times for level 3 visits, for which Medicare paid him an average of $43.57, less than half as much as he received per visit in 2015.</p>\n<p>In Oak Harbor, Washington, doctors <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/doctors/1922085901\">Robert Lycksell</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/doctors/1407830441\">Zayan Kanjo</a> also didn’t bill for level 5 visits in 2012. Lycksell billed for 1,948 level 5 visits in 2015 and Kanjo 1,297 in 2015. The doctors did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>\n<p>Weston said it’s “disappointing” that the same problems identified years ago appear to remain today. Some of what’s happening, she said, is related to electronic medical record systems that assign billing codes based on the computer boxes doctors click during office visits.</p>\n<p>“Those programs tend to upcode,” meaning to bill at a higher level than justified, Weston said. If doctors copy and paste phrases about a patient’s condition and their electronic medical record automatically decides how to bill for the visit, “that is worrisome.”</p>\n<h3>How We Did This Analysis</h3>\n<p>For this story, ProPublica analyzed provider billing patterns for standard office visits in Medicare. We focused on those for established patients who had been seen at least one time by the provider previously. These are among the most common services performed in the program.</p>\n<p>We used data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showing the services provided by and payments made to providers in Medicare's Part B program in 2015. Medicare redacted data on services when a provider billed for a service for fewer than 11 patients.</p>\n<p>More than 490,000 providers billed the program for standard office visits for at least 11 patients in 2015.</p>\n<p>Office visits are coded using the Current Procedural Terminology system devised by the American Medical Association and used by Medicare. The severity of each visit depends on three criteria: the thoroughness of the review of a patient's medical history, the comprehensiveness of the physical exam and the complexity of medical decision-making involved.</p>\n<p>An uncomplicated visit, typically of short duration, should be coded a 99211; a visit that involves more intense examination and often consumes more time should be coded a 99215. The most common codes for visits are in the middle, a 99213 or 99214.</p>\n<p>To protect against variation hidden by redactions, we focused on the nearly 364,000 providers who billed for at least 100 standard visits in 2015.</p>\n<p>We identified more than 1,250 providers who billed for every office visit using the 99215 code. We found another 570 providers who billed level 5 visits at least 90 percent of the time.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7860122.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/annie-waldman\">Annie Waldman</a> </p>\n<p>For our analysis of birth complications, we acquired all inpatient discharge records of hospital stays for a two-year period (2014 and 2015) across three states: New York, Florida and Illinois. We received these datasets from state health agencies, which collect hospital data at the patient level, including information on a patient’s diagnoses, characteristics, procedures and services. While there are some small differences in how each state reports data, many researchers use this data to study health care system inequities, like racial or socioeconomic gaps.</p>\n<p>To explore the racial disparities in birth complications, we focused on one of the most common and preventable causes of maternal mortality and morbidity: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=most+common+causes+of+maternal+death+hemorrhage&ei=7dw2Wrm0O8GWmQGA1a2ICg&start=10&sa=N&biw=1348&bih=737\">hemorrhage</a>, or excessive bleeding. We chose hemorrhage because unlike other causes of maternal harm, such as hypertensive and blood clot disorders, hemorrhage is less strongly associated with race or socioeconomics compared to other factors. Because of this weaker association and its relative high frequency across hospitals, we used post-hemorrhage outcomes as a proxy variable for understanding larger trends of morbidity and mortality. Across our dataset of three states, we analyzed over 1 million births and more than 67,000 hemorrhage events.</p>\n<p>Employing a methodology that has been used by prominent researchers, including members of the <a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/\">California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative</a>, we started by finding the number of women at each hospital who hemorrhaged during birth and then found how many of those women had major complications after or along with that hemorrhage, including needing a blood transfusion or hysterectomy. Based on previous research conducted by the CMQCC, we postulated that the lower the number of cases that include these major complications, the better that hospital is at managing these hemorrhages.</p>\n<p>Research has shown that when hospitals <a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/sites/default/files/Main%20etal%20SMM%20HEM%20at%20SMFM%20copy.pdf\">decrease</a> their rate of complications after or along with hemorrhages, the overall maternal morbidity rate declines. The findings suggest that targeted improvements of obstetric protocols related to one preventable birth complication may have a positive effect on a hospital’s ability to respond to birth complications generally.</p>\n<p>“It creates improvement in the team, increases communication and improves your response to all emergencies, not just hemorrhage,” said Dr. Elliott Main, the director of CMQCC. Ultimately, a hospital that is better at managing hemorrhage may also be better at managing other morbidity events.</p>\n<h3>Identifying Births</h3>\n<p>To identify all births and morbidity events, including hemorrhage, ProPublica used a <a href=\"http://safehealthcareforeverywoman.org/aim-program/aim-data/\">coding algorithm</a> developed by the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, also known as AIM, a national maternal safety and quality improvement initiative that uses data to improve maternal birth outcomes. We identified all births using delivery diagnosis, procedure or diagnosis-related group codes. As prescribed by the AIM algorithm, we excluded cases of ectopic or molar pregnancy, or any other pregnancy with an abortive outcome.</p>\n<h3>Identifying Hemorrhages</h3>\n<p>AIM’s algorithm relies on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/smm/severe-morbidity-ICD.htm\">indicators</a> of severe maternal morbidity that have been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has identified associated International Classification of Diseases, also known as ICD, codes to help hospitals and researchers better identify maternal morbidity events. We looked at events that were marked with ICD codes for procedures and diagnoses, as well as the diagnosis-related group classification system. Within the time period that includes our data, the ICD codes shifted from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Fortunately, the coding tool from AIM included a crosswalk that enabled us to include both iterations of payment coding. All of the codes used in this analysis can be found <a href=\"http://safehealthcareforeverywoman.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AIM-SMM-Codes-List_Latest.xlsx\">here</a>. To flag all hemorrhage cases, we relied on AIM’s algorithm, which identified specific ICD and diagnosis-related groups for previa, abruption, antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage diagnoses, and blood transfusions. We excluded patients who hemorrhaged that concurrently had a sickle cell diagnosis.</p>\n<h3>Identifying Severe Maternal Morbidity Indicators</h3>\n<p>Relying on AIM’s algorithm of indicators of severe maternal morbidity, we identified all cases of acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, adult respiratory distress failure, amniotic fluid embolism, aneurysm, cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, eclampsia, heart failure during a surgery or procedure, puerperal cerebrovascular disorders, pulmonary edema, severe anesthesia complications, sepsis, shock, thrombotic embolism, blood transfusion, conversion of cardiac rhythm, hysterectomy, temporary tracheostomy, and ventilation using procedure, diagnosis and diagnosis-related groups.</p>\n<h3>Calculating the Hemorrhage Complication Metric</h3>\n<p>To calculate a “hemorrhage complication rate” for each hospital, we divided the number of hemorrhages that occurred after or along with other noted morbidity events by the total number of hemorrhages at each hospital.</p>\n<p>While we did not control for factors at each hospital like average level of prenatal care or the socioeconomic level of the patient, we did look at comorbidities of patients, isolating the patients that were “healthier” from those that arrived at the hospital with additional chronic health factors. We defined our healthy pool by looking at mothers who were of average age at delivery (between 25 and 31 for Illinois and Florida and between 26 and 32 for New York) and did not, according to the data, have diabetes, heart disease or hypertensive disorders.</p>\n<p>To identify comorbidities, we relied on the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, which is a method of identifying comorbidities using ICD codes. There are about 30 categories in the Elixhauser Index. Each category is dichotomous, meaning that a patient either has a comorbidity, like diabetes, or the patient does not. The mapping algorithm that we are using for the Elixhauser categories comes from the <a href=\"https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidityicd10/comorbidity_icd10.jsp\">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a>, a federal medical research agency. For our analysis, we also looked at two different hospital cohorts: hospitals with more than 50 births and those with more than 500 births across two years.</p>\n<p>Our data analysis focused on hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of black patients compared to other hospitals within each state. We then compared these hospitals to those that serve fewer black patients. To do this, we split hospitals into three groups (high black-serving, medium black-serving and low black-serving). In order to prevent any one hospital from over-representing the pool, we limited the number of categories to three. We then compared trends in each group to determine whether hospitals that serve more black patients had higher or lower rates of birth complications on average.</p>\n<p>For Illinois and Florida, we clustered the hospitals using Jenks natural breaks optimization with three classification groups. For New York, we grouped the hospitals with the same clustering technique, but with five classification groups (the two highest groups representing “high”), in order to achieve a similar cluster size as the two other states. The number of hospitals in each group and the thresholds for low, medium and high groups varied by state.</p>\n<p>Across all three states that we looked at, we found a clear racial gap in hemorrhage complication rates. While black mothers appear to hemorrhage at about the same rate as mothers of other races, on average, they have much higher rates of complications related to hemorrhage.</p>\n<p>At disproportionately black-serving hospitals in all three states, the average number of maternal hemorrhages that occurred alongside a severe maternal morbidity event was significantly higher than at hospitals that serve disproportionately fewer black patients.</p>\n<p>This trend was consistent even when looking at only healthy patients, specifically patients who did not have heart disease, like congestive heart failure of valvular disease, hypertension or diabetes. The pattern was also consistent for patients at large hospitals (those with over 500 births over two years).</p>\n<p>We also looked at the gap in the quality of care between white mothers at hospitals that disproportionately serve black patients and those that don’t. White mothers have worse post-hemorrhage outcomes at hospitals that disproportionately serve black patients than those that don’t. This suggests that one can’t attribute the difference in hospital outcomes to inherent differences in the groups of patients they serve. Because the hospitals that have the worst outcomes on average primarily serve black patients, there is a disproportionate impact on patients who receive care at institutions that primarily serve black patients. This finding suggests that the quality of care at a hospital may factor into a woman’s risk of birth complications.</p>\n<p>This analysis has some limitations. It relied on inpatient hospital discharge data, which is self-reported by hospitals. The data is submitted for billing purposes and is supposed to be accurate, but we cannot account for errors or inaccuracies in what hospitals submit.</p>\n<p>Because of the way that the data is coded, we do not know whether hemorrhages occurred before, after or at the same time as the other severe maternal morbidity events, therefore it’s difficult to determine whether the relationship between hemorrhage and any other severe maternal morbidity events is causal. That being said, Dr. Main, who has employed the AIM methodology for his own studies, told ProPublica that hemorrhage is likely the cause of at least 90 percent of the complications included in this kind of an analysis and it’s probable that only 10 percent of these events are incidental.</p>\n<p>Additionally, our analysis does not take into account severity of hemorrhage or other birth complications. One of the most common indicators of birth complications in our analysis was the presence of a blood transfusion. Some hemorrhage events require multiple transfusions of blood, while other events may only require one. The administrative payment datasets that we are using only take into account whether the hemorrhage was severe enough to warrant a transfusion. We don’t have access to individual patient clinical records and therefore don’t have a complete picture of a patient’s health history which could include factors that contribute to birth complications.</p>\n<p>We believe this metric is a reasonable proxy for overall care at the hospital and we hope that researchers with greater access to clinical datasets will examine this further.</p>\n<p><em>For our analysis, we received data from New York's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, also known as SPARCS and the Illinois Department of Public Health, Office of Policy, Planning and Statistics. We also received a limited dataset from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration specifically disclaims responsibility for any analysis, interpretations, or conclusions that may be created as a result of its limited data set.</em></p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7860124.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/rachel-glickhouse\">Rachel Glickhouse</a> </p>\n<p>The days after Election Day last year seemed to bring with them a rise in hate crimes and bias incidents. Reports filled social media and appeared in local news. There were the letters calling for the genocide of Muslims that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/27/trump-will-do-to-you-muslims-what-hitler-did-to-the-jews-mosques-get-threatening-letters/?utm_term=.7edd7bbf455c\">were sent to Islamic centers from California to Ohio</a>. And the <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/blog/rash-of-vandalism-swastikas-and-harassment-reported-following-election-day\">swastikas</a> that were scrawled on buildings around the country. In Florida, “colored” and “whites only” signs were <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/os-tns-racist-signs-water-fountains-20161111-story.html\">posted over water fountains</a> at a high school. A man assaulted a Hispanic woman in San Francisco, telling her <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/11/14/latina-nanny-victim-of-hate-crime-in-san-francisco/\">“No Latinos here.”</a></p>\n<p>But were these horrible events indicative of an increase in crimes and incidents themselves, or did the reports simply reflect an increased awareness and willingness to come forward on the part of victims and witnesses? As data journalists, we went looking for answers and were not prepared for what we found: Nobody knows for sure. Hate crimes are so poorly tracked in America, there’s no way to undertake the kind of national analysis that we do in other areas, from bank robberies to virus outbreaks.</p>\n<p>There is a vast discrepancy between the hate crimes numbers gathered by the FBI from police jurisdictions around the country and the estimate of hate crime victims in annual surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The FBI counts <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016\">6,121 hate crimes</a> in 2016, and the BJS estimates <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5967\">250,000</a> hate crimes a year.</p>\n<p>We were told early on that while the law required the Department of Justice to report hate crime statistics, local and state police departments aren’t bound to report their numbers to the FBI — <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-crimes-are-up-but-the-government-isnt-keeping-good-track-of-them\">and many don't</a>. Complicating matters further is that <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/2014-adl-updated-state-hate-crime-statutes.pdf\">hate crime laws vary by state</a>, with some including sexual orientation as a protected class of victims and some not. Five states have no hate crime statute at all.</p>\n<p>We decided to try collecting data ourselves, using a mix of social media newsgathering and asking readers to send in their personal stories. We assembled a <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes\">coalition of more than 130 newsrooms</a> to help us report on hate incidents by gathering and verifying tips, and worked on several lines of investigation in our own newsroom.</p>\n<p>Along the way, we’ve learned a lot about how hate crimes fall through the cracks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>More than half of hate crime victims don't file reports to the police, according to a June <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/victims-in-thousands-of-potential-hate-crimes-never-notify-police\">BJS report</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many police officers <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-crime-training-for-police-is-often-inadequate-sometimes-nonexistent\">get little to no training about how to handle hate crimes</a>. Only 12 states have statutes requiring this type of instruction at police academies.</p></li>\n<li><p>At the local level, there are <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-america-fails-at-gathering-hate-crime-statistics\">widespread discrepancies in what police consider a hate crime</a>, as well as confusion about how and whether to track hate crimes as such.</p></li>\n<li><p>Last year, <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrime-map\">almost 90 percent of local law enforcement agencies reported having zero hate crimes</a> in their communities.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even if hate crimes are investigated, they aren't always prosecuted. In Texas, 981 potentially bias-motivated crimes were reported to police from 2010 to 2015. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-crime-law-results-in-few-convictions-and-lots-of-disappointment\">Only eight cases ended in convictions</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Like local police, federal agencies often <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/more-100-federal-agencies-fail-report-hate-crimes-fbi-national-database\">fail to send their hate crime statistics</a> to the FBI, too.</p></li>\n<li><p>Violence by white supremacist groups sometimes goes unchecked by police, as was the case in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/police-stood-by-as-mayhem-mounted-in-charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a> and with members of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/white-hate-group-campaign-of-menace-rise-above-movement\">Rise Above Movement</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve received thousands of tips so far through our <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes-form\">embeddable incident reporting form</a>. We’ve also added tips sent to us by civil rights groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Have You Witnessed or Been the Victim of a Hate Incident?</h3>\n<p>ProPublica is collecting accounts of hate crimes from victims and witnesses. <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes-form\">Tell us your story.</a></p>\n</aside>\n<p>ProPublica and reporters in newsrooms around the country used those tips to tell the stories of people who’ve come forward as victims or witnesses.

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/andrea-salcedo\">Andrea Salcedo</a> </p>\n<p>Louise Kiernan, who came to ProPublica Illinois from Northwestern University, where she taught journalism, and previously the Chicago Tribune, believes the most rewarding aspect of being an editor is helping journalists become great storytellers. In the 12th of a series of Q&amp;As with ProPublica Illinois staffers, Kiernan talked with ProPublica Emerging Reporter Andrea Salcedo.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired you to become a journalist and eventually an editor?</strong></p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171226-louise-kiernan-natlight-0875-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171226-louise-kiernan-natlight-0875-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171226-louise-kiernan-natlight-0875-3x2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171226-louise-kiernan-natlight-0875-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Editor-in-Chief Louise Kiernan\n<span>(Michael Schmidt, special to ProPublica Illinois)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I should have known I wanted to be a journalist long before I did because I was involved in school newspapers in one way or another from the time I was in elementary school. But I actually didn’t realize I wanted to be a journalist until I was one. I ended up in Oklahoma a year or two out of college and I had this idea that being a newspaper reporter would be fun, so I called every paper I could find to see If I could get a job. I finally found a newspaper that was willing to give me a chance: the Claremore Daily Progress. It was a tiny, 5,000-circulation daily newspaper. I covered everything there. I covered police, fires, school board meetings — I went to rodeos. Any kind of story you could imagine. It was the best job. I couldn’t believe they would pay me to do it, which is good because they hardly paid me. I had to work as a cocktail waitress on weekends just to make ends meet. I made $5.25 an hour as a reporter, but I just couldn’t imagine anything more rewarding than doing that work.</p>\n<p>From there, I bounced around through a couple of other small papers in Texas and Tennessee, then I decided to go to graduate school in journalism because I felt I was never going to get as good as I wanted to be. I went to Northwestern for graduate school and got an internship at the Chicago Tribune. I worked for the Tribune for 18 years, moving from being a reporter to being a projects reporter and editor. When I left the paper in 2010 to teach at Northwestern, I was the enterprise editor.</p>\n<p><strong>How has your teaching background helped you in your role as editor-in-chief at ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of parallels between teaching and editing. Being a professor made me a better manager because running a classroom is managing a classroom. You are always juggling and thinking about people’s needs and how to address them. That’s also part of being an editor. It made me a better communicator because I had to learn how to convey elements of journalism in a way that people could understand them, even if they felt instinctive to me. And most important for me, classrooms are optimistic places. One of the things I loved most about teaching was the optimism of my students and their energy and hope to create a better world. Part of what attracted me to ProPublica is that it’s a very optimistic place. Fostering that sense of optimism in our newsroom stems in part from feeling that optimism when I taught.</p>\n<p><strong>What has been your most rewarding experience as a journalist and editor?</strong></p>\n<p>As a reporter, the most rewarding work for me has been to be able to step into worlds that I wouldn’t have otherwise known anything about and to try to understand them. When I was in graduate school, I took a class in legal reporting. Another student and I signed up to cover juvenile court. It was such a formative experience as a journalist to be inside that building and to see injustice, poverty and lack of opportunity play out in so many people’s lives in ways that were largely invisible to the rest of the city. That was a turning point for me in how I thought about journalism and what it could accomplish. As an editor, the most rewarding elements of my work are to help people become great journalists and tell powerful stories.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you hope the stories you oversee at ProPublica Illinois will spark change?</strong></p>\n<p>We always strive to create concrete change, to find places where we can have a real-life impact, whether that means getting a law changed, an injustice overturned or exposing wrongdoing that is then corrected. I would love for us to be able to look back in a few months or a year and really see that we have made things happen through our reporting. In a year, I would like to think that we could point to a number of stories that have created change in the place where we all live and that we care about.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you spot a good story?</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone approaches stories in a different way. Some people think of issues or topics and then they drill down to the specific story. They might say, “I’m really interested in how property taxes work,” or “I’m really interested in the criminal justice system,” then they search for the story within that framework. I tend to work on the opposite end. I will see something small and I’ll wonder, “Well, why is that happening?” For me, almost all the best stories come from a simple question and paying attention to what is around me and wanting to know more about it.</p>\n<p><strong>In past interviews, you have emphasized the importance of collaboration among local newsrooms. Why do you believe it’s important to support other local news organizations and collaborate with them?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re all stronger and better when we work together. Already, what we see from the collaborations we’ve done is that if you bring different resources and strengths to a story, you build a better story and you reach broader and more diverse audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you consider good qualities in an editor and how do you try to apply those traits in your role as editor-in-chief at ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>I think a good editor is a good listener, a good questioner, a strong advocate for their reporters and for their reporters’ work, and knows the right times to fortify everybody with food.</p>\n<p><strong>What has been the biggest lesson journalism has taught you?</strong></p>\n<p>Empathy. Whenever you try to understand people and to step inside their lives, even just a little bit, it makes you more open to the world.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7849301.gif\" height=\"1\">",

Chris Brown of the department’s Professional Oversight Unit wrote in an email that its investigation into the tickets had been sustained, and the citations were in the process of being voided. All but one of the pedestrians who received the false tickets is black.</p>\n<p>“Additionally, a bulletin was issued to the entire department explaining that Florida State Statute 322.15, which prohibits the possession of mutilated licenses and requires licenses to be carried, only applies to motorists,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>In late June, Devonte Shipman <a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/public-safety/2017-06-26/video-shows-jacksonville-cop-threatening-young-black-man-jail-after\">filmed his pedestrian stop</a> in the Arlington neighborhood. The resulting video went viral and spurred the ProPublica/Times-Union investigation. Although Shipman voluntarily identified himself, he was told he needed to carry a driver’s license and was cited by Officer Jack S. Bolen.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office voided that ticket after the Times-Union identified it as being given in error, and launched an administrative investigation into Bolen’s conduct recorded in the video. The status of that investigation is unknown, but as of Dec. 7, Officer Bolen was working in the department’s Teleserve unit, which often indicates an ongoing review.</p>\n<p>ProPublica and the Times-Union identified six others instances of pedestrians receiving that citation from sheriff’s officers, and one such ticket issued by a Jacksonville Beach police officer.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Jacksonville Beach Police Department Commander Steve Corbitt said his agency voided that ticket and conducted a training session in which it stressed that the citation is only meant for motorists. Each officer signed an acknowledgment that they received the training.</p>\n<p>“You found an error and y’all were correct,” Corbitt said. “We’re appreciative that you brought it to our attention.”</p>\n<p>ProPublica and the Times-Union also identified 353 erroneous crosswalk tickets in Duval County, and <a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/metro/news/public-safety/2017-12-20/florida-police-issue-hundreds-bad-pedestrian-tickets-every-year\">thousands more across the state</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that <a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/public-safety/2017-12-13/pedestrian-tickets-lead-hundreds-suspended-driver-s-licenses\">132 of the erroneous crosswalk tickets led to suspended driver’s licenses</a>, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office has no plans to review those citations, agency spokeswoman Lauri-Ellen Smith said earlier this month.</p>\n<p>“If the ticket is disputed in court and a judge asserts it was written incorrectly because of an officer’s lack of proper application of the statute, we’ll address that as a training issue,” Smith said.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7813554.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/paul-kiel\">Paul Kiel</a> </p>\n<p>The boxy building that houses JC Foreclosure Service doesn’t look like much. Drive past, and you might miss it among the gas stations and body shops and small homes here in Bell, a working class, Hispanic enclave in the south part of Los Angeles County. The only thing that might catch your attention is the bold red writing on the front window that says, in Spanish, “WE MODIFY YOUR LOAN. EVICTIONS. BANKRUPTCIES.”</p>\n<p>But inside, a kind of magic happens. The owner of the business, Carlos Baez, is a master of a Los Angeles art: contorting bankruptcy into a tool for profit. When his clients come to him, desperate to stay in their homes, he can promise help — as long as they keep paying him — by harnessing the power of bankruptcy to stop foreclosure. Baez is not a lawyer and records show the hundreds of cases he’s filed are often shoddily prepared and thrown out within a few months. But actually winning lasting debt relief for his clients isn’t the point. The goal is to buy time — which he does again and again.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are laws to prevent such abuse of the system. If someone files again and again, bankruptcy’s protections can be revoked. But Baez has another technique he often uses. On paper, his clients appear to transfer ownership in their homes to a group of people who get 5 percent apiece. It’s a trick that can turn one homeowner into four homeowners, each of whom can file for bankruptcy, one after the other. It doesn’t matter if these new homeowners are real. By the time a flesh-and-blood person must appear at a hearing, a month or two has passed. Then the case is dismissed and a new homeowner comes forward. Rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>With tricks like this, foreclosure can be kept at bay for months and sometimes years. It’s the kind of brazen fraud one would expect to be swiftly spotted and punished. But this is Los Angeles, where Baez is not a remarkable innovator, but merely one more practitioner in a decades-old local industry. He’s been at it for more than 10 years. It’s hard to keep track of all the bankruptcy laws he’s broken and based on his answers to my questions, he won’t be stopping anytime soon. He’s helping his clients, he says, and that’s what bankruptcy is for.</p>\n<p>I came to Los Angeles because national filing data showed something remarkable was happening there. No other district in the country has anywhere close to the number of cases filed without an attorney as the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, a warning sign because debtors generally fare much worse without legal representation. Digging deeper, our analysis found thousands of cases filed each year that bore the hallmarks of fraud.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it turned out this is an open secret not only among the judges and court administrators in the district, but also among bankruptcy experts nationwide. Twice, Congress has even passed laws to combat the bankruptcy-related schemes emanating from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>This is what underscores the frustration of Judge Maureen Tighe, who presides in the district and has tried to raise the alarm about the level of fraud. A former prosecutor, she directs court employees to look for suspicious people, tries to sanction those breaking the law, and helps publish reports on the scale of potential fraud. She’s even called special hearings. But that is where her powers stop. And the arms of the justice system charged with policing these crimes — the U.S. Attorney and the Federal Bureau of Investigation — rarely do.</p>\n<p>“If nobody follows the law, and there’s no enforcement mechanisms or enforcement resources, what good is the law?” Tighe asked.</p>\n<p>The success of these schemes reflects a basic fact about the bankruptcy system. For people with the sophistication and resources to hire reputable attorneys, bankruptcy works well. For others, there are traps.</p>\n<p>ProPublica has been examining deeply ingrained problems in the nation’s bankruptcy system using a first-of-its-kind analysis of filings. Across the country, we’ve found how the costs of filing have, in various ways, caused harm to those bankruptcy was designed to serve. Earlier this year, we reported on how <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bankruptcy-inequality/bankruptcy-failing-black-americans-debt-chapter-13/\">black Americans in the South are far less likely to attain lasting debt relief from bankruptcy</a> because steep, up-front attorney fees force them to choose bankruptcy payment plans they are likely to fail.</p>\n<p>In Los Angeles, we found, vulnerable people with debt, particularly minorities and immigrants, are more likely to try navigating the system with no attorney at all. Many turn to unlicensed bankruptcy petition preparers like Baez, who often operate beyond what the law allows and hide their involvement in filings.</p>\n<p>Court districts in other parts of the country with high numbers of <em>pro se</em> filings — places like Atlanta, Detroit and Milwaukee — have similar fraud problems, particularly involving unscrupulous petition preparers who flout the rules and overcharge for their services.</p>\n<p>“There are all these people that need the relief of the bankruptcy system, who can’t afford it,” said Tighe. “And they fall prey to these fraudsters. If we had adequate access to our legal system, they would not be this wonderful ripe field for picking by the fraud artists.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-LA-Bankruptcy-Tighe-1.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Judge Maureen Tighe, a former federal prosecutor, has tried to raise the alarm about fraud in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, where she has been on the bench since 2003.\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Despite these destructive patterns, both in the South and in Los Angeles, we found an entrenched lack of will to stop them.</p>\n<p>Without much criminal enforcement of the laws, the amount of fraud in the Central District of California rises and falls with the economy. During the foreclosure crisis in 2011, when the district’s 126,000 consumer bankruptcy filings accounted for nearly a tenth of all such filings in the country, it exploded. But, in an area where so many struggle to afford their homes, plenty of fraudsters are still in business.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Trustee Program, which oversees the bankruptcy court, refers hundreds of potential crimes to the local U.S. Attorney office every year. In most years, only one to three cases result in prosecution, according to data obtained by ProPublica through a Freedom of Information Act request. In 2009, not a single one of the 266 criminal referrals made by the U.S. Trustee office in the district resulted in prosecution.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of frustration, I think, among some members of the U.S. Trustee Program who feel like they’re doing their darndest trying to do something about this type of financial crime,” said Jennifer Braun, who worked as an attorney with the program’s district office until earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Federal prosecutors cite a lack of resources and a need to pursue higher profile crimes as the reason for the dearth of bankruptcy cases. Untangling the complicated schemes is a lot of work for a low-wattage win, they said.</p>\n<p>As a result, especially in the largely Hispanic and immigrant neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles, it’s not hard to find examples of these schemes. All I had to do was look.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I found Liderazgo Financiero just a couple miles away from JC Foreclosure. “NO PIERDA SU CASA” — Don’t Lose Your Home — said the printed sign hanging over a barred window outside. Inside, stacks of lime-green mailers covered in urgent warnings about foreclosure in Spanish sat on a desk, ready to be sent out.</p>\n<p>“The only way to stop a foreclosure is a bankruptcy,” Santiago Nuñez told me when I visited his small office in South Gate last June. “You have to do a Chapter 13.”</p>\n<p>Chapter 13 really is the best option under the bankruptcy code for someone facing foreclosure. Theoretically, struggling homeowners can catch up on their mortgages through a payment plan, typically lasting five years, calibrated to their income.</p>\n<p>But even when debtors file with an attorney, Chapter 13 has its risks. Without an attorney, it’s almost hopeless.</p>\n<p>Between 2008 and 2014, almost half of the Chapter 13 bankruptcies filed in the Central District of California were done without an attorney. About 85 percent of these <em>pro se</em> filings were left incomplete, lacking the debtors’ basic financial information, according to ProPublica’s analysis. Nearly all were dismissed within a few months, meaning the debtors were back at square one with no debt relief.</p>\n<p>When I reviewed 50 <em>pro se</em> Chapter 13 filings in mostly Hispanic areas where bankruptcies without attorney representation are most common, I found that two-thirds of the debtors ultimately lost their homes, usually within a year of filing.</p>\n<p>Neither Nuñez, nor his wife, Veronica, who owns the company, is an attorney.</p>\n<p>Switching between English and Spanish, Nuñez affably described the services Liderazgo offers clients desperate to save their homes. Local bankruptcy attorneys, he said, can bill up to $5,000 to file under Chapter 13, but his company charges clients just $200. Attorney fees for Chapter 13 in Los Angeles do indeed range from $4,000 to $5,000, but many attorneys accept a portion of that up front, with the remainder paid through the plan. Much to the frustration of judges and attorneys in the district, companies like Liderazgo often lure in clients with promises of a cheap rescue, but then end up extracting fees similar to what attorneys charge.</p>\n<p>When I asked Nuñez about his fees, he conceded that the $200 covered only the most basic document — the petition. To file all the necessary information about the debtor’s incomes, assets and debts, the company charged $1,500, he said.</p>\n<p>That’s against the law. Non-attorneys are permitted to assist someone with a bankruptcy, but if they accept payment, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334301-Bankruptcy-Petition-Preparer-Guidelines-Central.html\">their activities are strictly limited</a>. They must disclose their involvement and can’t give legal advice. In Los Angeles, anyone can open up shop as a petition preparer, but the maximum they can accept for filling out the forms is $200.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-no-pierda.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The office of Liderazgo Financiero in South Gate, California. The owners are not attorneys, but have filed hundreds of bankruptcies, often violating the law.\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>One preparer I spoke with said the job is all but impossible to do well and also be in compliance with the law. “You can’t be a preparer and not give legal advice, because if a client has any question [about the bankruptcy], and you answer the question, you’re giving them legal advice,” said Christian Yates, a paralegal. After being fined by Tighe in 2012 for violating filing laws, Yates said he now only assists with bankruptcies with a lawyer present, which is allowed. But other preparers are “going to continue to do it until they get caught,” he said.</p>\n<p>The preparers are most active in the district’s Hispanic neighborhoods, but they are everywhere, promising help with both Chapter 13 and Chapter 7, which typically wipes away debts within a couple months. One debtor I met at a court hearing, who asked that his name not be used, told me that he’d found a preparer by simply Googling “Los Angeles Paralegal” and had paid $750. Petition preparers are forbidden from using “legal” or similar words in advertising their services, but many just ignore that.</p>\n<p>According to court records, Araneta Legal Services, which until recently operated the website losangelesparalegal.org, didn’t disclose that it had filled out the debtor’s petition. Preparers can evade the attention of the court by simply not disclosing their involvement in a case, another violation of law. Joseph Araneta, the company’s owner, did not respond to my calls and emails. The company appears to have shut down.</p>\n<p>As for Liderazgo, records show that it has been involved in more than 200 bankruptcies since the middle of 2012. In at least 56 of them, the company didn’t disclose its involvement.</p>\n<p>I was able to tie these cases to the company because Veronica Nuñez is identified in court data as having brought them to the courthouse. As a way to combat preparers dodging the disclosure requirements, all five court locations in the district began requiring non-attorneys in 2012 to present their ID when filing bankruptcies for clients in person. The court shared this data with ProPublica. But even this tally is likely incomplete, since Santiago Nuñez told me that the company generally requires its clients to file the cases themselves. Doing so is another way for preparers to avoid scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Some of the Liderazgo bankruptcies I looked at were clearly phony. In one scheme that ran from 2009 and 2015, 18 different debtors listed the same Compton address as their home on their bankruptcy filings, but only one of them actually lived in the 1,100-square-foot house, according to public records.</p>\n<p>Veronica Nuñez brought eight of these Compton bankruptcies to the courthouse, the court data shows. A ninth bankruptcy was filed under the name of Juan Azuaje, a man who had hired Liderazgo to help avoid foreclosure on his home 50 miles away in Simi Valley, according to a recording of a court hearing in 2012. Court records show he, or someone using his name, filed two separate bankruptcies on the same day — one listing the Simi Valley address as his home, the other the Compton address. Public records show Azuaje had no connection to the Compton home, which was ultimately foreclosed on. Azuaje and the former owner of the Compton property could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Liderazgo’s frequent filings haven’t gone unnoticed by the court entirely. In January 2012, a judge in the district <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334665-Order-to-Show-Cause-Nunez.html\">issued an order</a> for Santiago Nuñez to appear and face possible fines for improperly filing a case. He didn’t show.</p>\n<p>That’s typical, Tighe said. “I have hundreds of orders that are being ignored.”</p>\n<p>Nuñez did not respond to a detailed list of questions that outlined several violations of the law.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In the summer of 2012, Mohsen Saeedy was desperate. An Iranian immigrant in his 50’s, he’d built up his own photo printing business in Los Angeles and poured his savings into a ranch-style house in Phoenix, Arizona, where he and his wife planned to retire. The interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgage had seemed affordable in 2007. It wasn’t anymore.</p>\n<p>Then he found JC Foreclosure. As Saeedy remembers it, the company promised to force the bank to modify his loan and knock the principal down to what the house was actually worth. Amid his desperation, Saeedy said, the promises were irresistible. He paid $1,000 to a middleman for connecting him with JC Foreclosure. Then he gave the company $1,600 to get started, and agreed to pay $600 every month in cash.</p>\n<p>Of course, JC Foreclosure had no special power to bend banks to the company’s will. But it had plenty of tricks.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-foreclosure.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The front windows of JC Foreclosure Service\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the company executed <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334670-Warranty-Deed-Transfer-1-Beneficiary.html\">a deed transfer</a> from Saeedy’s wife, who was the title-holder of the Arizona home, to a woman named Marian Garcia. Later, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334671-Warranty-Deed-Transfer-3-Beneficiaries.html\">a second</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334672-Warranty-Deed-Transfer-1-Beneficiary-2nd.html\">then a third deed</a> transferred interests in the home to four other individuals. Saeedy told me he’d never heard of Garcia or any of the other people, and his wife said she never signed any such deeds.</p>\n<p>In these types of arrangements, Chapter 13’s power to protect can be deployed over and over for the same home as long as each debtor appears to have a claim to bankruptcy’s protections.</p>\n<p>It’s “the cheapest temporary restraining order anybody can get,” Tighe said.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear if any of these people knew they’d gained an interest in an Arizona home. A couple of them don’t appear to be real.</p>\n<p>But one unwitting new owner of a piece of Saeedy’s property is definitely a real person. In fact, he’d already filed his own, unrelated bankruptcy case — after initially filing on his own, he then retained an attorney. Unbeknownst to him, scam artists had transferred portions of at least 11 properties, Saeedy’s home among them, to him, according to motions filed in his case.</p>\n<p>Attorneys, judges and prosecutors call this fraud technique “hijacking.” Fraudsters simply pick a recently filed bankruptcy — it doesn’t matter which one, really — and then pretend the debtor in that case owns the properties the fraudsters want to protect. It’s a neat ploy that stops foreclosure and saves the expense of the filing fee.</p>\n<p>“Hijackings” like these create headaches for attorneys and judges and put legitimate debtors in danger of being adversely affected. Renay Rodriguez, an attorney in Los Angeles, handled one case in which portions of 13 different properties were transferred to her clients. “It was absolutely bewildering to try and explain to them,” she said.</p>\n<p>The other four people who received an interest in Saeedy’s home all filed for bankruptcy <em>pro se</em>. One appears to be a real person who, with the help of a different petition preparer, filed for bankruptcy nine times over six years and finally was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334685-Order-Barring-Debtor-From-Filing.html\">barred</a> by a judge from ever filing again. Another claimed to live at JC Foreclosure’s business address.</p>\n<p>When I visited this summer, the company’s small office was empty except for a woman at the front desk.</p>\n<p>She told me the company didn’t file bankruptcies because Baez, the owner, wasn’t a lawyer. Instead, she said, the company referred clients to a law firm when bankruptcy seemed appropriate. She couldn’t remember the name of the firm.</p>\n<p>On the counter in front of her desk — next to a stack of mailers, marked “URGENTE,” addressed and ready to send to potential clients — were bankruptcy forms, filled out for a debtor by the name of Suyay Crow, but yet to be filed.</p>\n<p>Later, when I checked public records, it appeared that no one by that name has ever lived at the South Los Angeles home that was listed in the bankruptcy filing. It was actually the second time Crow had filed for bankruptcy at that address, each time without an attorney. Crow, who may or may not exist, had gained an interest in the property through a deed executed last March.</p>\n<p>The next day, I visited that South Los Angeles home. Four cars were parked outside, and children played in the yard. Junk, including an old fish tank and tires, lined the front porch. The owner of the home, an 86-year-old black woman, answered the door in a wheelchair. She said she lived there with her niece, son and his two daughters and had owned the home for over 20 years.</p>\n<p>The woman, who asked that her name not be used, told me she’d never heard of Crow, Baez or JC Foreclosure. She was facing foreclosure, she said, because a loan had jumped in payments. Using another nearby petition preparer, she’d twice filed for bankruptcy under her own name in recent years. Both times the cases were quickly dismissed. But she said that she knew nothing about other filings and had never signed any deed transferring an interest in the property.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t have nothing to do with it, nothing at all,” she told me.</p>\n<p>Public records show that the lender foreclosed on the home in October.</p>\n<p>Since 2012, Baez has brought at least 237 bankruptcy cases to the courthouse. In only 10 cases was a preparer disclosed. As with Liderazgo, the count likely captures only a portion of the company’s activity, especially since JC Foreclosure has been operating since 2005, long before the court began tracking suspicious filers more closely.</p>\n<p>The company appears to routinely charge its clients fees well in excess of the allowed $200 for its services, as it did Saeedy. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334704-JC-Foreclosure-Contract.html\">One contract</a> shared with me from last year shows the company charged $1,200 to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Cycles of fake bankruptcies can prevent foreclosure for years, but sometimes mortgage servicers eventually figure out the scheme and file a motion to stop it. In response to a string of seven filings that appear to have been arranged by Baez (court data shows he personally brought at least two of the cases to the courthouse), an attorney for a mortgage servicer declared <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334707-Motion-of-Relief-From-Stay-Vasquez.html#document/p8/a394612\">in a 2013 motion</a>, “The abuse of bankruptcy laws must be put to an end. Enough is enough.”</p>\n<p>The mortgage servicer eventually <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334711-Motion-of-Relief-From-Stay-Saeedy.html\">caught on</a> in Saeedy’s case, too, and obtained <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334713-Motion-of-Relief-From-Stay-Saeedy-Order.html\">an order</a> preventing any future bankruptcy from stopping foreclosure on the property. For more than a year, Saeedy paid Baez’s company with the expectation of a loan modification, he said. Then Baez abruptly informed him the company could do nothing more to help him. Foreclosure was again imminent. In a fresh panic, Saeedy filed for bankruptcy on his own to stop the sale and then quickly retained an attorney.</p>\n<p>Only then, he said, did he learn about the fraudulent bankruptcies. His lawyer explained that because of them, his own bankruptcy had not halted foreclosure.</p>\n<p>Almost four years later, Saeedy is still picking up the pieces. He ultimately decided to drop his bankruptcy case because he didn’t see the point. He regrets not having filed earlier. “I would have a much different outcome,” he said.</p>\n<p>Typical of those who are swindled, Saeedy didn’t file a complaint or go to the authorities. Instead, he said, he has been “in denial” about the thousands of dollars he wasted. “I didn’t want to think about how stupid I was.”</p>\n<p>I sent questions to Baez, laying out the evidence that his company had violated bankruptcy laws hundreds of times. I also detailed four other deed transfer schemes in addition to the ones discussed in this story.  </p>\n<p>In a written response, Baez didn’t deny or admit forging documents or filing bankruptcies in the names of fake people. He declined to discuss any particular case, saying that doing so would require a signed release from the client.</p>\n<p>Instead, he argued that since his company filed bankruptcies to benefit clients, the filings had not been fraudulent, since the bankruptcy laws “are there to protect debtors.” He also said I was wrong to say he worked as a petition preparer because most of his clients “do not come to us just to file a bankruptcy.” He charges clients more than $200, he said, because the company spends a lot of time working with clients. “It is common practice among many service providers to assist their clients in filing a Chapter 13 if more time is needed in negotiating with the lenders,” he added.</p>\n<p>There is no exception in the law that allows businesses to charge more than $200 if they provide other services in addition to preparing bankruptcies.</p>\n<p>Baez said that his office routinely provides clients “the service” of bringing their bankruptcy filings to court and paying the filing fees. That is a violation of the law. </p>\n<p>But he said that my questions had spurred “a careful review of our business practices.” Going forward, JC Foreclosure will require that clients file their own bankruptcies, he said.</p>\n<p>In a sign of the challenges the court faces, this promised change will simply make it harder for the court to track the company’s activities.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Prosecutions of bankruptcy fraud weren’t always as rare as they are now. In 1988, when Tighe began her career as a prosecutor in Los Angeles, her sole responsibility was combatting such fraud. Even then, the area demanded attention due to the extremely high number of filings by debtors without attorneys and the proliferation of petition preparers.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-la-bankruptcy-tighe-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Tighe asked, “If nobody follows the law, and there’s no enforcement mechanisms or enforcement resources, what good is the law?”\n<span>(Kendrick Brinson for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“I put a lot of them in jail,” Tighe said of the early innovators of fraud in the district. Into the 1990s, bankruptcy prosecutions remained a priority. In 1996, then Attorney General Janet Reno launched a national effort focused on the problem called “Operation Total Disclosure.”</p>\n<p>But national statistics show these prosecutions began to dwindle after 2001. By 2011, the number of federal prosecutions in which a bankruptcy crime was the lead charge had dropped by more than half, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.</p>\n<p>This drop came despite some internal alarms. At the FBI, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334953-FBI-Intelligence-Assessment-US-Bankruptcy-System.html\">a 2010 intelligence assessment</a>, since made public, concluded that fraudulent bankruptcies, particularly those used to thwart foreclosures, would have a “significant impact on the US mortgage, banking, and securities industries; consumers; and the overall US economy.”</p>\n<p>The schemes affect banks, investors and neighborhoods by drawing out inevitable foreclosures. They also cause unnecessary foreclosures by ensnaring struggling homeowners who might have succeeded in keeping their homes by legitimate means.</p>\n<p>Despite the assessment, there is no evidence that resources were re-allocated.</p>\n<p>In interviews, former federal prosecutors said budget cuts have gutted their ability to pursue such cases.</p>\n<p>Evan Davis, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, recalled his frustration when it was his job to coordinate federal bankruptcy prosecutions in the district during the foreclosure crisis, and the local U.S. Trustee office was sending him a steady stream of possible crimes to investigate.</p>\n<p>“My inbox would get clogged with referrals that I had no interest in reading, because I knew they would go nowhere,” he said. “We would sit there lamenting that we can’t do more of these cases.”</p>\n<p>Robert Dugdale, an assistant U.S. Attorney who was chief of the criminal division in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2015, said there was “a hiring freeze in our office for a number of years, so that everybody who left couldn’t be replaced.” At one point, he said, money was so tight that just sending a package by FedEx required a memo justifying the expense.</p>\n<p>Constraints were even worse at the FBI, they said. After the 9/11 attacks, domestic terrorism became a major focus for the FBI and other law enforcement, drawing resources away from white-collar prosecutions. On top of that, FBI agents were “effectively dissuaded from pursuing [bankruptcy] cases,” Davis said, because bankruptcy fraud is classified in the lowest band of white-collar crimes.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Trustee Program has also been squeezed by budget cuts. In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334960-UST-Statement-to-Congress-2017.html\">recent testimony</a> to Congress, the director of the program boasted about its “diligent management of increasingly scarce resources,” as its staff has been reduced by 14 percent over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>U.S. Trustee attorneys can bring civil cases in response to violations, but not criminal charges. For that, they refer cases to other agencies. State and local prosecutors can sometimes bring charges, but only if local laws have also been violated as part of the scheme.</p>\n<p>In a statement to ProPublica, the Justice Department emphasized activities by the U.S. Trustee Program to identify bankruptcy crimes and train others to recognize it: “Over time, these collective efforts within the Justice Department and with the wider bankruptcy community may result not only in an increase in referrals and prosecutions, but also in greater deterrence of bankruptcy crimes at the outset.” The statement didn’t explain how this increase in prosecutions “may” occur.</p>\n<p>The lack of resources available for bankruptcy-related prosecutions isn’t limited to Los Angeles. In Milwaukee, bankruptcy judges have long been concerned by the conduct of petition preparers.</p>\n<p>“It’s somewhat tragic because the people who are being victimized by this are the most defenseless people out there,” said Judge Susan Kelley, the chief bankruptcy judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>Every April, after the harshest months of the Midwestern winter have passed, Milwaukee’s energy utility ends its winter moratorium on shutting off gas or electrical service due to nonpayment. Threatened with losing service, many residents respond by filing for bankruptcy — often with the help of preparers, Kelley said.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of these debtors are low-income and black. According to ProPublica’s analysis of filings in the district from 2013 through 2015, almost half of the Chapter 7 cases filed by debtors from majority black areas were done without an attorney. In the mostly white areas, only 5 percent of filings were <em>pro se</em>.</p>\n<p>Stopping these preparers has sometimes proven beyond the powers of the court. In one example, judges twice sent U.S. Marshals to force a preparer to appear before them and explain why she had ignored court orders and fines. When even that didn’t stop her, the court <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334981-Recommendation-for-Criminal-Contempt.html\">sought criminal sanctions</a>.</p>\n<p>The local U.S. attorney’s office, however, declined to prosecute, because doing so “would not be a wise use of law-enforcement resources,” according to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334982-WIED-District-Court-Order.html\">a district court order</a>.</p>\n<p>“I just find it very frustrating that we can’t do something more,” said Kelley, who said she can’t recall hearing about a single prosecution of a preparer in the district. “These people are preying on the poorest of the poor.”</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Thom Mrozek, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles, acknowledged that staffing has been particularly diminished “at several points over the past 10 years,” but said that it’s on the upswing. “We allocate our limited resources after taking into account the facts of an individual case, as well as our desire to address the most serious crimes and maximize deterrence in areas of most concern.”</p>\n<p>The office <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/long-beach-man-sentenced-4-years-federal-prison-misusing-bankruptcy-courts-operate\">has brought</a> a few <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/alleged-architect-30-million-mortgage-relief-fraud-scheme-and-four-other-los-angeles\">significant prosecutions</a> for bankruptcy fraud in recent years. But sometimes even those cases have a way of highlighting how limited the enforcement of bankruptcy laws has been.</p>\n<p>Last June, the U.S. filed charges against Mickey Henschel, who is something of a Los Angeles institution. In 1995, he was the subject of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-28/news/mn-7026_1_van-nuys\">a profile in The Los Angeles Times</a>. The author marveled that, despite several allegedly fraudulent activities (including arranging bankruptcies by fictitious people), Henschel had managed to stay out of jail. Nine years later, the Times <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/04/business/fi-mickey4\">again reported on Henschel</a>, noting, “One of the safest places to engage in fraud is Southern California,” and again marveled at his ability to avoid prison, despite several scrapes with the law and a long history of alleged bankruptcy fraud.</p>\n<p>Now in his late 60s, Henschel has finally <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/van-nuys-man-named-federal-fraud-indictment-alleging-7-million-foreclosure-delay-scam\">been indicted</a> for an alleged scheme to string along desperate homeowners by filing phony bankruptcies, among other tactics. His company has collected more than $7 million from victims, according to prosecutors. Henschel pleaded not guilty. His attorney did not respond to my questions.</p>\n<p>To prosecutors who have worked in the district, the existence of longtime operators like Henschel offers some explanation for why bankruptcy fraud is so common here. The fraudsters teach their craft to others, who teach still others. By now, the skillset is hopelessly widespread. And the demand, when the economy sours, can be limitless.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got this major consumer fraud problem here, and we don’t have any deterrent,” said Tighe. “It’s a shame, because it gives bankruptcy a bad name for the people who really need it and who are using it legitimately.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7812342.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/heather-vogell\">Heather Vogell</a> </p>\n<p>As Leana Torres began high school, family crises — her estrangement from her father, her stepmother’s terminal cancer — shadowed her through the hallways. She experimented with drugs and got C’s, D’s and F’s in class.</p>\n<p>Torres could have become a casualty of her difficult home life — the sort of student school districts may all but write off because circumstances outside the classroom seem to overwhelm teachers’ best efforts. But she didn’t. When her mother and educators enrolled her in a public alternative school in Bentonville, Arkansas, they were opening doors for her, not shutting them.</p>\n<p>“My mom actually sent me here as a punishment,” says Torres, who has long dark hair and big brown eyes, “but it’s actually the best thing that’s happened to me.”</p>\n<p>At the Gateway Alternative School, Torres found a close-knit community where she could catch up on coursework and lean on adults and other students who understood what it was like to encounter major obstacles as a teenager.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of like a big support system,” says Torres, 17, who graduates this month with A’s and B’s and wants to become a real estate agent. “You go around the corner and there’s somebody to help you.”</p>\n<p>Torres’ success is no fluke. It’s exactly the sort of life-changing turnaround that officials in Bentonville, and the state of Arkansas, expect from their alternative schools for at-risk students.</p>\n<p>In other states, such schools are often spare and prison-like, offer computer-based courses instead of meaningful interaction with teachers, and provide little counseling. Many students are subjected to harsh discipline and, some allege, even <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/these-for-profit-schools-are-like-a-prison\">physical abuse</a>.</p>\n<p>But in Arkansas, one of the poorest states in the country, educators have taken another path. The state government has encouraged — and helped pay for — a network of local alternative schools with rich academic offerings, social and mental health support, and standards modeled on what research shows works best to reduce bad behavior, poor grades and absenteeism.</p>\n<p>Arkansas allocates an extra $4,600 for each alternative school student — on top of the standard state and local expenditure of $6,700 per pupil. For alternative schools to receive the extra stipend, classes can have no greater than a 1:15 teacher-student ratio (and many are smaller). Even students in small schools often can choose from electives and career-vocational classes and participate in clubs and sports. Mental health counseling is generally available.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to calculate a graduation rate for the state’s alternative schools, because they’re mostly grouped for statistical purposes with regular schools, to which nearly a quarter of their students return. Still, their emergence coincided with a decline in Arkansas’ overall dropout rate from 2002 to 2012, a <a href=\"http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2017/Meeting%20Attachments/410/115/ALE%20State%20Categorical%20Funding%20Review.pdf\">November</a> state report shows. Another indicator of their success: although traditional schools are encouraged to recommend only about 3 percent of their students for alternative schools, nearly 10 percent of all graduates in the state have spent some time in alternative education.</p>\n<p>Some states’ approach to alternative education is to “take the least and give them less,” says state Alternative Education Director Lori Lamb. “We don’t do that in Arkansas.” One of the state’s main goals, she adds, is to erase the stigma of attending alternative schools, and change perceptions so students — and taxpayers — see them as an intervention, not punishment.</p>\n<p>Denise Riley, an Oklahoma-based education consultant on the board of the National Alternative Education Association, says Arkansas has become a leader in alternative education by constantly evaluating itself and incorporating new research into its practices, providing strong but supportive oversight of school districts, and fostering programs where adults build solid relationships with students.</p>\n<p>“They’ve approached it almost like you would if you taught a gifted class,” Riley says.</p>\n<p>In certain ways, Arkansas’ philosophy runs counter to the Trump administration’s. The state urges districts to keep alternative schools’ population “substantially similar” to that of regular schools — a goal that aligned with federal guidance under former President Barack Obama. Yet under U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, federal officials are proposing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/politics/devos-obama-special-education-racial-disparities.html\">to delay a rule</a> that would discourage schools from over-identifying minority students for special education and segregating them in separate classrooms, or disciplining them disproportionately.</p>\n<p>DeVos also favors expanding the roles of charter schools and for-profit education management companies to promote school choice, which she has suggested can lower absenteeism and dropout rates. Though for-profit charter schools specializing in “dropout recovery” abound elsewhere, Lamb says only one charter school chain, a nonprofit, has met Arkansas’ rigorous standards to qualify for alternative education funding.</p>\n<p>In a sense, Arkansas has taken alternative schools back to their roots as child-centered, less competitive and more flexible places for students who struggle to thrive in regular schools. That mission was subverted as schools across the country adopted rigid, “zero-tolerance” disciplinary practices in the 1990s and then faced pressure to boost test scores as a result of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Neglected and underfunded, many alternative schools now offer substandard academics in decrepit buildings or trailers, and serve mainly as warehouses for students with behavior problems or bad test scores. Increasingly, they’re run by private companies that profit by providing bare-bones instruction and billing states for potential dropouts who <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/for-profit-schools-get-state-dollars-for-dropouts-who-rarely-drop-in\">rarely show up for class</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alternative-education-using-charter-schools-hide-dropouts-and-game-system\">ProPublica</a> investigation this year found that nationwide, nearly a third of the alternative-school population attends a school that spends at least $500 less per pupil than regular schools do in the same district. Four in 10 school districts don’t provide counseling in their alternative schools, though they do in regular schools. States often hold alternative schools to lower standards than regular ones, too — sometimes providing students far fewer hours of teaching than their counterparts in regular schools.</p>\n<p>In some states, students are largely forced into alternative schools, even <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-students-get-banished-to-alternative-schools\">for minor behavioral offenses</a> like cursing or disrespect. And while just 6 percent of regular schools across the country have graduation rates below 50 percent, ProPublica’s analysis found nearly half of alternative schools do.</p>\n<p>Arkansas’ strikingly different approach dates back to 2002, when lawmakers expanded the state’s alternative schools in response to a state Supreme Court decision that declared the state’s education system inequitable and inadequate. The reforms mandated that every school district have an alternative program available for its neediest students.</p>\n<p>Arkansas alternative students must meet two of a dozen criteria, which include having been an abuse victim, received inadequate emotional support at home, exhibited disruptive behavior, or repeatedly failed to achieve proficiency in math and literacy. Poor academic performance is not reason enough. Students are referred to the program by educators or parents, and enrollment is mostly voluntary.</p>\n<p>Unlike in many districts elsewhere, Arkansas discourages traditional schools from gaming accountability measures by pushing out poor performers to alternative schools. Instead, students’ test scores and graduation status in alternative programs are usually reported as part of their home school’s performance. When they graduate, most students receive a diploma from the regular school.</p>\n<p>Under state guidelines, the alternative schools must not be punitive. Academic failures and even disciplinary incidents typically elicit more help — not suspension or expulsion. Schools must offer services — such as access to a school counselor, mental health professional or school nurse — that, at a minimum, are similar to what is available for students in regular schools.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the state’s alternative programs aren’t perfect. Some have waiting lists and small or aging facilities, leaving them unable to help as many students as they’d like. Others, like those elsewhere in the country, struggle with student absenteeism.</p>\n<p>The state has continued to monitor its alternative schools closely and refine its approach. “I always say students don’t have to meet the program’s needs,” Lamb says. “The program needs to change to meet their needs.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The state’s approach is visible in school hallways. At four alternative schools I visited in early December, chatter — not forced silence, or chaos — filled the hallways between periods, with students socializing briefly before disappearing into classrooms. In some, student artwork or photos of teens taking part in special events or projects adorned the walls.</p>\n<p>At Gateway Alternative School in Bentonville — headquarters to retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc., where Torres works after school in customer service — students learn business concepts in one course by running a bike repair shop.</p>\n<p>They fix bikes mainly for the district’s physical education classes and a smattering of paying customers.</p>\n<p>At tables in the nearby cafeteria one Tuesday this month, students talked, worked on laptops, or read. It was a “seminar day,” when time was set aside for students who needed extra help so they could be tutored by teachers in small groups. Those in the cafeteria were caught up, and had earned a few minutes to socialize as a reward. The program is one of the school’s ways to individualize instruction, instead of relying on generic computer courses.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Program Coordinator Kale Eaton said 11 of his 12 teachers have masters’ degrees, and turnover is low. The school experiences few disciplinary issues, he says — even with students who arrive with reputations for misbehavior. “It’s a fresh start and we treat it like a fresh start with them,” he said.</p>\n<p>About a half-hour drive from Bentonville is the Archer Learning Center, located in a refurbished furniture store in Springdale. Principal Shawna Lyons and Assistant Principal Coby Davis, who both have doctorates in education, use a host of strategies to ease the transition for newcomers. They include a welcome meeting in which the student, parents and school staff sit in a circle and talk.</p>\n<p>The school is dedicated, too, to using alternative options to traditional punishments like expulsions and suspensions. They include “positive behavior supports” — rewards, encouragement and changes in the students’ environment and routines to reduce challenging behavior — as well as “restorative justice,” in which students discuss and make amends for transgressions. The school is also trying to incorporate “mindfulness” into its days through yoga and other strategies aimed at soothing the nerves of students who often facing significant challenges outside its walls.</p>\n<p>Lyons and Davis say the measures are paying off: Incidents of misbehavior referred by school staff for discipline dropped from 285 in 2014-2015, to 38 in 2015-2016 and 35 last school year.</p>\n<p>Attention to students’ overall well-being helps students such as Mariah Lopez, 16, a junior at Archer. Like many of her peers in alternative programs, she had serious anxiety at the larger high school she used to attend. “Every single day I’d cry and stay in the bathroom,” she recalls. She never raised her hand in class, she says, even when she had a question.</p>\n<p>At Archer, she feels comfortable speaking up and seeking extra help. Teachers are patient and approachable. She’s even grown confident enough to return to her regular school early each morning for a dance class before heading to Archer. “They really saved me here,” she says.</p>\n<p>The school also builds in time for training its teachers to help kids who are struggling in class, and offers students regular field trips to colleges and technical schools. Of 106 fourth and fifth-year seniors eligible for graduation in 2017, Davis says, 94 received diplomas.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From the outside, the Russellville Secondary Alternative Learning Center looms as a Depression-era monolith with windows that were boarded up long ago, reportedly to save money during the energy crisis.</p>\n<p>But inside, the school’s classrooms have an inviting feel. Teachers and administrators have turned the windows into bookcases, decorating them with artwork and knick-knacks. Principal Josh Edgin, a soft-spoken former basketball and football coach, stands in the school’s wide corridor and jokes with staff and students.</p>\n<p>“It’s a family atmosphere,” Edgin says. “You build these relationships with kids and they don’t want to disappoint you.”</p>\n<p>Unlike many alternative programs in other states, the center doesn’t offer computer-based “credit recovery” courses for students who failed the first time around. All instruction is provided by teachers, and students who need to catch up can attend extra classes after school. “Students need it,” Edgin says of teachers’ attention, “they need that interaction.” A computer, he adds, can’t see frustration.</p>\n<p>It also can’t see when students are barely able to stay awake — because they worked late, or had issues at home. But Edgin and his teachers can, and, instead of chastising those who fall asleep in class, they invite them to put their head down on a desk for a half-hour in a quiet room. “We’re not going to ruin a school day over a nap,” Edgin says.</p>\n<p>All the personal attention at the center tends to erase discipline problems, Edgin says. Student David Tisby, 17, says he was so confused in classes such as math at his regular high school that he often left questions on classwork blank. He also amassed a disciplinary record for acting up in class, according to Edgin.</p>\n<p>But at the center, Tisby says teachers helped him when he needed it and made sure he caught up. The school uses a nine-week semester that allows students to accumulate an extra credit. (Twenty-two credits are required for a high school degree.) “I like it better,” Tisby says, adding he has “perfect attendance” now. He should finish his graduation requirements by March, and plans to walk with his peers in May. Edgin says Tisby doesn’t cause the sort of disruptions that landed him in trouble before, either. “He’s happy,” the principal says, a “big-smile kid.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Some of the alternative schools in other states that I reported on this year offered hardly any elective classes or career-vocational programs, which many students were interested in. But in a high-poverty neighborhood on the outskirts of Little Rock, students at the alternative school North Little Rock Academy can choose electives such as art, music, psychology and television production. They can take a bus, too, to attend career-tech programs in subjects such as accounting and marketing. The school — housed in a spacious former middle school — has a garden and a hothouse out back.</p>\n<p>On a recent afternoon, Principal Charles Jones walked in to a shop class as it was wrapping up. Three students were sitting at a table they had just finished building and singing a gospel song, banging a hammer to keep rhythm. It was one Jones knew. He jumped in, harmonizing with them.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad about it,” they sang, “I’m so glad to be here.”</p>\n<p>Like Edgin, Jones relies heavily on his personal connection to students. He grew up in one of the poorer neighborhoods where many of his students come from. He matches everyone with a mentor at the school. Many of the teachers’ aides he hires are young African-American men who have faced similar challenges. The goal, he says, is to help students address their problems and return to their home school — or prepare for college.</p>\n<p>“I tell people there’s no such animal as a bad kid,” Jones says, just “bad choices, bad neighborhoods, bad influences.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7810876.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/logan-jaffe\">Logan Jaffe</a> </p>\n<p><em>This story was first published in ProPublica Illinois’ weekly newsletter. <a href=\"http://go.propublica.org/illinois-updates\">Sign up for that here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/list-of-mediathings-in-illinois\">I asked for your help</a> making a list of where Illinoisans get specific information about their communities and interests. For lack of an actual term to describe the kind of media I was interested in learning about, I made one up: Mediathings.</p>\n<p>Mediathings … you know, things like neighborhood newsletters, SMS alerts, Reddit threads, library bulletin boards, even weekly “ladies lunch” meetups.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard from a lot of people so far (thank you!) — and I’m going to tell you a bit about some of their responses — but I’m still on the hunt for more suggestions. Read on, and if you can think of some more to contribute, please write me at <a href=\"mailto:logan.jaffe@propublica.org\">logan.jaffe@propublica.org</a>, respond to this email directly or tweet me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loganjaffe\">@loganjaffe</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a number of independent publications and online groups for specific Chicago neighborhoods, of course. Two that folks suggested are the <a href=\"http://www.uptownupdate.com/\">Uptown Update</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.edgevillebuzz.com/\">Edgeville Buzz</a>. One that came as a surprise to me — and maybe will to you — is the <a href=\"http://bcochicago.org/bowmanville-bee-newsletter\">Bowmanville Bee</a> printed newsletter. If you’re unaware that Bowmanville is an actual Chicago neighborhood, it’s on the city’s north side, bordered by Rosehill Cemetery to the north, Foster Avenue to the south, and between Lincoln Square and Andersonville. Its community newsletter has been publishing seasonally since 1991. <a href=\"http://bcochicago.org/bowmanville-bee-newsletter\">Take a look at it here</a>.</li>\n<li>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HartmanMath\">HartmanMath</a> tweeted me to say, “The Mahomet Daily has been a bastion of transparency for a small town.” Mahomet is a town in central Illinois of a bit over 7,000 people. <a href=\"http://mahometdaily.com/\">The Mahomet Daily</a> is an independent publication run by a three-person team. Dani Tietz (owner, editor, writer, designer, sales representative, marketing manager) writes she was formerly on an advisory board of local elected officials but has since stepped down after buying the paper in 2013. In a <a href=\"http://mahometdaily.com/about/\">heartfelt and blunt letter</a> published on the newspaper’s website, she details how she sees her role at The Mahomet Daily and in her community:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”We live in a town where I can almost guarantee you that any reporter has never asked questions other than who, what, when or where. I am gathering that information for you, but I am also asking why and how. I care about your ideas, your hearts, your visions and even your voice. I want to and have celebrated all of our wonderfulness with you. I have also sat with you on the phone, listening to your concerns and felt what you are feeling. These are the issues that have not made it into an article. These are the issues that we all need to work on together.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Another reader pointed me to the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/\">UIUC subreddit</a>, where students at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign swap information about classes and exams but also pose some on-point questions to each other, such as: “<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7l3jvp/when_is_it_appropriate_to_give_your_professor_a/\">When is it appropriate to give your professor a holiday gift?</a>”, “<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7l79of/anywhere_i_can_get_halal_the_dish/\">Anywhere I can get halal?</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7j9jej/is_living_on_the_first_floor_safe/\">“Is living on the first floor safe?”</a></li>\n<li>Bob, who’s “retired to the middle of nowhere, where the county seat has only 750 souls,” emailed me to suggest I add “good public library reference librarians” to the Mediathing list. He wrote that the library in nearby Princeton has hosted several programs sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/voicesfromtheprairie/\">Voices from the Prairie</a> that speak to local, political issues. And he makes a good point about librarians’ role as ‘Mediathings:’</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In the sense that journalists create news, good public library reference librarians remember news…and disseminate it as well as provide access. So they are also among the mediathings in “media space” … My more general point is that public libraries - and reference librarians - provide the memory that complements what journalists do. They are unacknowledged brothers and sisters.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What else? Let me know. And if you’ve already suggested to me Mediathings that you don’t see in this e-mail, know that I have read your messages, and added your recommendations to an ongoing document I’ve been updating. I’m still thinking through with my team what to do with that, exactly. But in the meantime, I’ll keep posting updates.</p>\n<p>Talk to you in the new year —</p>\n<p>Logan</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7809956.gif\" height=\"1\">",

An additional 96 are environmental protection specialists, a broad category that includes scientists as well as others experienced in investigating and analyzing pollution levels. Nine department directors have departed the agency as well as dozens of attorneys and program managers. Most of the employees who have left are not being replaced.</p>\n<p>The departures reflect poor morale and a sense of grievance at the agency, which has been criticized by Trump and top Republicans in Congress as bloated and guilty of regulatory overreach. That unease is likely to deepen following revelations that Republican campaign operatives were using the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/politics/epa-pruitt-media-monitoring.html\">Freedom of Information Act</a> to request copies of emails from EPA officials suspected of opposing Trump and his agenda.</p>\n<p>The cuts deepen a downward trend at the agency that began under the Obama administration in response to Republican-led budget constraints that left the agency with about 15,000 employees at the end of his term. The reductions have accelerated under Trump, who campaigned on a promise to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/climate/trump-epa-budget-superfund.html\">dramatically scale back the EPA</a>, leaving only what he called “<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1436/dramatically-scale-back-epa/\">little tidbits</a>” in place. Current and former employees say unlike during the Obama years, the agency has no plans to replace workers, and they expect deeper cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“The reason EPA went down to 15,000 employees under Obama is because of pressure from Republicans. This is the effort of the Republicans under the Obama administration on steroids,” said <a href=\"https://savetheusepa.org/john-j-ogrady-biography/\">John O’Grady</a>, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a union representing EPA employees.</p>\n<p>ProPublica and The New York Times analyzed the comings and goings from the EPA through the end of September, the latest data that has been compiled, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The figures and interviews with current and former EPA officials show the administration is well on its way to achieving its goal of cutting 3,200 positions from the EPA, about 20 percent of the agency’s work force.</p>\n<p>Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the EPA, said the agency was running more efficiently. “With only 10 months on the job, Administrator Pruitt is unequivocally doing more with less to hold polluters accountable and to protect our environment,” he said.</p>\n<p>Within the agency, science in particular is taking a hard hit. More than 27 percent of those who left this year were scientists, including 34 biologists and microbiologists; 19 chemists; 81 environmental engineers and environmental scientists; and more than a dozen toxicologists, life scientists and geologists. Employees say the exodus has left the agency depleted of decades of knowledge about protecting the nation’s air and water. Many also said they saw the departures as part of a more worrisome trend of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/climate/epa-scientists.html\">muting government scientists</a>, cutting research budgets and making it more difficult for academic scientists to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/climate/pruitt-epa-science-advisory-boards.html\">serve on advisory boards</a>.</p>\n<p>“Research has been on a starvation budget for years,” said <a href=\"https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/aboutepa/acting-assistant-administrator-office-research-and-development-and-acting-epa-science_.html\">Robert Kavlock</a>, who served as acting assistant administrator for the Office of Research and Development before retiring in November. Under earlier buyouts, Kavlock said, the agency later hired nearly 100 postdoctoral candidates to help continue critical agency work.</p>\n<p>“There wasn’t a reinvestment this time around,” he said. “There’s a hard freeze.”</p>\n<p>Scientists, for the most part, are also not being replaced. Of the 129 people hired this year at the EPA, just seven are scientists. Another 15 are student trainee scientists. Political appointees, however, are on the rise. The office of Scott Pruitt, the agency administrator, is the only unit that saw more hires than departures this year.</p>\n<p>In addition to losing scientists themselves, the offices at the EPA that deal most directly with science were drained of other workers this year. The Office of Research and Development — which has three national laboratories and four national centers with expertise on science and technology issues — lost 69 people, while hiring three. At the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, responsible for regulating toxic chemicals and pesticides, 54 people left and seven were hired. And in the office that ensures safe drinking water, one person was hired, while 26 departed.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Pruitt’s office hired 73 people to replace the 53 who left.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important to focus on what the agency is all about, and what it means to lose expertise, particularly on the science and public health side,” said <a href=\"https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-deputy-assistant-administrator-epas-office-research-and-development-and-epas-science_.html\">Thomas Burke</a>, who served as the agency’s science adviser under Obama. “The mission of the agency is the protection of public health. Clearly there’s been a departure in the mission.”</p>\n<p>Wilcox disputed that assessment and said the agency remained an attractive workplace for scientists. “People from across EPA were eligible to retire early with full benefits,” he said in an emailed statement. “We currently have over 1,600 scientists at EPA and less than 200 chose to retire with full benefits.”</p>\n<p>The impact of losing so many scientists may not be felt for months or years. But science permeates every part of the agency’s work, from assessing the health risks of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/harvey-arkema-crosby-chemicals.html\">chemical explosions</a> like the one in Houston during Hurricane Harvey to determining when groundwater is safe to drink after a spill. Several employees said they feared the departures with few replacements in sight would put critical duties like responding to disasters and testing water for toxic chemicals in jeopardy.</p>\n<p>As of Dec. 6, there were 14,188 full-time employees at the EPA By comparison, there were 17,558 workers at the end of the first year of the George W. Bush administration and 17,049 by the end of the first year of President Obama’s term. The EPA offered two major buyouts during the Obama administration, losing 900 employees in 2013 and an additional 465 the following year. Hundreds of other workers left through attrition and were not replaced.</p>\n<p>Pruitt’s office has described the current buyout process as a continuation of Obama administration efforts to ensure that payroll expenses do not overtake funding for environmental programs.</p>\n<p>Agency staff said they believed the Trump administration was purposely draining the EPA of expertise and morale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/26035\">Ronnie Levin</a> spent 37 years at the EPA researching policies to address lead exposure from paint, gasoline and drinking water, most recently working as a lead inspector at the agency’s regional office overseeing New England. She retired in November after what she described as months of low morale at the agency. And with the lead enforcement office targeted for elimination as part of Trump’s proposed budget, she said, “It was hard to get your enthusiasm up” for the job.</p>\n<p>“This is exactly what they wanted, which is my biggest misgiving about leaving,” Levin said. “They want the people there to be more docile and nervous and less invested in the agency.”</p>\n<p>Lynda Deschambault, a chemist and physical scientist who left the EPA at the end of August after 26 years, said her office in Region 9, based in San Francisco, had been hollowed out. The office saw 21 departures this year and no hires. “The office was a morgue,” she said.</p>\n<p>Conservatives who helped lead the Trump administration’s transition and prepared for eliminating vast parts of the agency said scientists’ worries were misplaced.</p>\n<p>“To me it’s not necessarily a sign of catastrophe,” said <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/staff/david-kreutzer\">David Kreutzer</a>, a senior researcher at the Heritage Foundation who advised Trump on the EPA during the transition. He said the agency under President Obama was engaged in “phenomenal overreach” and that the Trump administration’s efforts were aimed at correcting that.</p>\n<p>In proposing this year to slash the EPA’s budget by 31 percent, Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, called the effort part of Trump’s plan to eliminate entrenched government workers. “You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,” Mulvaney said. “So, I guess the first place that comes to mind will be the Environmental Protection Agency.”</p>\n<p>Jan Nation, who works in EPA’s Region 3, based in Philadelphia, where 46 people either retired or took a buyout this year, lamented the administration’s approach to federal workers. “We are not the swamp. The swamp are all the people who don’t have a specific function to make our government work,” Nation said. “If you have a swamp to drain, I know people in the Army Corps of Engineers who can do it.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7809018.gif\" height=\"1\">",

But more than 135 expectant and new mothers a day — or more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html\">50,000</a> a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — endure dangerous and even life-threatening complications that often leave them wounded, weakened, traumatized, financially devastated, unable to bear more children or searching in vain for answers about what went wrong.</p>\n<p>For the past year, ProPublica and NPR have been examining why the U.S. has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world. The <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system\">700 to 900</a> deaths each year related to pregnancy and childbirth, though, overshadow a more pervasive problem that experts call “severe maternal morbidity.” For every U.S. woman who dies as a consequence of pregnancy or childbirth, up to 70 suffer hemorrhages, organ failure or other significant complications, amounting to more than 1 percent of all births. The annual cost to women, their families, taxpayers and the health care system runs into billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>“There’s this misconception that these complications are rare,” said Kristen Terlizzi, cofounder of the National Accreta Foundation, who had her uterus, appendix and part of her bladder removed in 2014 because of a life-threatening placenta condition, “and we [women] get brushed off — ‘The risk is not a big deal.’ But it is.”</p>\n<p>Better care could have prevented or alleviated many of these complications, experts say. Maternal morbidity encompasses a spectrum of problems, from moderately serious to near-deadly, and proper medical attention can stop treatable conditions from spiraling out of control. In <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27210068\">a 2016 study</a> of all women admitted for delivery over 30 months at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, researchers found “opportunity for improvement in care” in 44 percent of life-threatening complications related to pregnancy and childbirth.</p>\n<p>What’s more, according to the CDC, severe maternal morbidity has risen faster than <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001799/\">maternal mortality</a>. Based on the rate per 10,000 deliveries, serious complications more than doubled from 1993 to 2014, driven largely by a five-fold rise in blood transfusions. That also includes a nearly 60 percent rise in emergency hysterectomies — removal of the uterus and sometimes other reproductive organs, often to stem massive bleeding or infection. In 2014 alone, more than 4,000 women had emergency hysterectomies, rendering them permanently unable to carry a child. The rates of new mothers requiring breathing tubes, and of treatment for sepsis — a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection that can damage tissues and organs — both increased by 75 percent. And the rate of women needing to be resuscitated from heart failure rose by 175 percent, to a total of roughly 400. </p>\n<p>“These numbers are really high, and far too many of them are preventable,” said Dr. Elliott Main, medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/\">California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative</a> and a national leader in efforts to reduce maternal deaths and injuries.</p>\n<p>Judged by one of the most life-altering impacts — a hysterectomy — the U.S. is an outlier in the industrialized world. U.S. women are about five times more likely than their British and Swedish counterparts to undergo a hysterectomy, according to Elena Kuklina, a CDC health scientist. They’re also three times more likely to need a breathing tube during and immediately after childbirth than women in the United Kingdom. The U.K. has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-giving-birth-is-safer-in-britain-than-in-the-u-s\">improved maternity care</a> by requiring every doctor to follow the same treatment protocols, and by examining every death to see what mistakes may have occurred.</p>\n<p>While hospital and government authorities in the U.S. often fail to investigate why a new mother died, complications that aren’t fatal receive even less scrutiny. More than 30 states and cities now have committees to review maternal deaths, but only one state — Illinois — has started to systematically examine severe complications. (That process, which began July 1, so far only has funding for one year.) New York City’s committee, which met for the first time this month, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/new-york-city-launches-committee-to-review-maternal-deaths\">plans to look</a> at both deaths and severe complications. The Joint Commission, the not-for-profit body that accredits health care facilities, requires hospitals to do a thorough analysis of severe morbidity (whether involving new mothers or any other patients) only when a complication is “not primarily related” to the “natural course of the patient’s illness or underlying condition.”</p>\n<p>More scrutiny of near-deaths could illuminate not only what went wrong but what went right. “Maybe everything was done really, really well, and they saved the woman’s life,” said Stacie Geller, a maternal health expert who directs the Center for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government, which stopped publishing an official annual count of pregnancy-related fatalities a decade ago, has had similar difficulties tallying harm that doesn’t lead to death. After analysts fixed a computer programming error that had inflated the total, the CDC reduced its estimate of cases of “severe maternal morbidity” this year from 65,000 to more than 50,000. But its current number may be an undercount. Indeed, when one patient safety group, the <a href=\"http://safehealthcareforeverywoman.org/aim-program/\">Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health</a> (AIM), analyzed 2015 data from hospitals in four states, the rate of morbidity was roughly 2 percent of births, which would translate to 80,000 cases a year nationwide.</p>\n<p>The CDC’s estimate encompasses 21 outcomes, from relatively minor hemorrhages if they require a blood transfusion, to kidney or respiratory failure. But it comes from hospital billing data generated when a new mother is discharged, and sometimes misses complications — bleeding, blood clots, even heart attacks — that may arise in the hours, days and weeks after she goes home. Hospital readmissions for childbirth-related ailments are difficult for researchers to track.</p>\n<p>“The nature of our system is to focus on these women while they’re pregnant,” said <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/eugene-declercq/\">Eugene Declercq</a>, a professor of community health services at Boston University School of Public Health. “And then if there are difficulties later, they get lost to the larger system that doesn’t particularly care about women’s health to a great degree unless they’re pregnant.”</p>\n<p>Samantha Blackwell experienced those postpartum difficulties. Eleven days after giving birth to her son in August 2014, Blackwell, then 25, woke with a pain in her lower abdomen so sharp that she couldn’t stand up straight, she said. The 25-year-old graduate student in nonprofit administration went to an emergency room at a hospital outside Cleveland, Ohio, where she was diagnosed with a massive infection and septic shock. According to her medical records, doctors performed a procedure known as a D&amp;C, removing 400 milliliters of unidentified, foul-smelling material from her uterus. But her condition rapidly deteriorated and she was flown to a larger hospital 15 miles away.</p>\n<p>While she lay in a medically induced coma, surgeons performed an emergency hysterectomy. When she regained consciousness a month later, she overheard her mother talking with a doctor, which was how she learned that her uterus had been removed.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-blackwell-3.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-blackwell-3.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-blackwell-3.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Samantha and DeVon Blackwell with baby Max a few months after her coma in 2014.\n<span>(Courtesy of Samantha Blackwell)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“I’d have a million more kids if I could,” she said. “I hadn’t known how much I would love being a mother before they put my son on my chest.”</p>\n<p>Blackwell was one of more than 4,000 women who <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-and-npr-investigate-maternal-mortality\">shared stories</a> with ProPublica and NPR of mothers nearly dying in childbirth. She was also one of more than 400 women who said they’d had an emergency hysterectomy. The procedure can often stop bleeding and save lives, yet it also ends women’s hopes for more children and sometimes leads to early menopause.</p>\n<p>“Angry and sad. I woke up to find out I no longer had a uterus,” wrote 40-year-old Alicia Nichols of Needham, Massachusetts, who works in a cosmetic surgery office. After she gave birth to her first child this past March, she began experiencing bouts of bleeding, and took an ambulance to a hospital emergency room, but a doctor there told her that her symptoms were normal and sent her home, according to medical records. When her daughter was about two months old, Nichols had another scary episode, and made another appointment with an OB-GYN.</p>\n<p>She was getting off the elevator at the doctor’s office when she began to hemorrhage. According to her medical records, she lost almost half her volume of blood. A week after being sent home, she was hospitalized with a life-threatening complication of that surgery, blood clots in both lungs.</p>\n<p>Nichols had gotten pregnant via in vitro fertilization, freezing the extra embryos in hopes of having more children. Rather than surrender those dreams, she’s considering hiring a surrogate to carry her embryos to term — at a cost that could exceed $80,000.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Childbirth is the leading reason that people go to hospitals, accounting for nearly <a href=\"https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb225-Inpatient-US-Stays-Trends.jsp\">12 percent</a> of all U.S. hospital stays in 2014. Unlike the average patient, expectant mothers tend to be relatively young and healthy, brimming with joyful anticipation.</p>\n<p>“You expect what you see in the movies,” said Leah Bahrencu, who taught Pilates and cardio-kickboxing in Austin, Texas, before she became pregnant with twins at 34. “Like it’s just routine: Your water breaks and you go to the doctor, and somewhere between four to maybe 20-something hours later, you have these babies.”</p>\n<p>Bahrencu’s pregnancy seemed to be on track until this past January, when she was in her 34th week. At a routine checkup, she was diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/hellp-syndrome\">HELLP syndrome</a>, a particularly dangerous variant of <a href=\"https://www.preeclampsia.org/\">preeclampsia</a> (pregnancy-induced hypertension), and rushed to the hospital for an emergency cesarean section.</p>\n<p>She then developed an infection that led to 10 days in a medically assisted coma. Her lungs, kidney and liver shut down, and she suffered permanent damage to her pancreas. “We almost lost her three times,” said her OB-GYN, Dr. Catherine Browne, whose voice broke repeatedly as she recalled the case.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-bahrencu-1.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-bahrencu-1.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-bahrencu-1.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-bahrencu-1.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-bahrencu-1.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Leah Bahrencu with her twins. After an emergency C-section, she developed an infection and her lungs, kidney and liver shut down. <span>(Ilana Panich-Linsman for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As with many women who contacted ProPublica and NPR, Bahrencu’s problems persisted long after she finally went home. Subsequent infections sent Bahrencu to the hospital three more times, Browne said. Bahrencu stopped working outside the home and has struggled to care for her premature babies. “Emotionally, I’m a wreck,” she said. “I’m overwhelmed, and have to force myself to get out of the house. If I could, I would stay in my room while the kids are in the other room.”</p>\n<p>She isn’t alone. Even seemingly temporary complications of pregnancy and childbirth may have long-term impacts on women’s physical and mental health. Preeclampsia, for example, substantially increases risks of heart disease and stroke later in life, while the trauma of a complicated birth can have emotional repercussions. About 1,370 women reported after-effects such as stress and depression, including more than 730 who told us that their physical suffering led to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, a potentially disabling and sometimes chronic condition more often associated with combat veterans than with new mothers. Such symptoms can typically include flashbacks, nightmares, memory problems and feelings of hopelessness.</p>\n<p>Up to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443054\">6 percent</a> of new mothers suffer from PTSD, due to childbirth complications and other factors such as prior trauma, according to Sharon Dekel, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School. Six months after giving birth, survivors of emergency hysterectomies are nearly 2.5 times more likely to have PTSD symptoms than women who didn’t have the surgery, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26781263\">according to a 2016 study</a>.</p>\n<p>“I've had dreams about being tied down ... and feeling like I can't breathe,” wrote a 36-year-old mother of two who teaches middle school in Manhasset, New York. She said she needed two surgeries and four pints of blood to stop a hemorrhage after an emergency C-section. “I was crying for a month after it happened,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I can't be without another adult with me at all times because I'm afraid of something happening to me and my baby will be alone. I constantly feel like I'm in survival mode,” wrote a 35-year-old stay-at-home mother of three in Traveler’s Rest, South Carolina, who said she survived a postpartum heart attack.  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>What’s behind the rise in severe morbidity in the U.S.? The reasons include striking declines in the health of women giving birth and inequities in access to insurance and maternity care.</p>\n<p>As in most other developed countries, American mothers are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db232.pdf\">older</a> than ever. The percentage of first-time mothers over 30 rose from 24 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2014. The uptick in age — combined with a rise in women’s average <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/12/look-at-how-much-weight-weve-gained-since-the-1960s/?utm_term=.9e4e491cfa75\">weight</a> — has meant that more pregnant women than ever suffer chronic ailments such as <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Task-Force-and-Work-Group-Reports/Hypertension-in-Pregnancy\">hypertension</a> and diabetes, which make pregnancy more complex to manage and increase the risk of problems during and after childbirth. In a <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf\">study of New York City hospitals</a> from 2008 to 2012, women with significant pre-existing conditions were three times as likely as other new mothers to experience life-threatening impacts of childbirth.</p>\n<p>Cindel Pena, 29, checked two of the boxes that increase the likelihood of a dangerous pregnancy. The 5-foot-4 project manager in Sacramento, California, weighed about 200 pounds during her pregnancy, and had previously been diagnosed with hypertension, according to Pena and her husband, Steven Peery. When her blood pressure spiked shortly before her due date in 2015, her OB-GYN ordered a C-section. The surgery went so well that Pena asked to check out of the hospital after just one day.</p>\n<p>“That was my first mistake,” she said. Two days later, she knew something was seriously wrong. She couldn’t stop crying, she said, adding, “My husband said I was walking through the house saying ‘I’m going to die.’”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbiity-pena-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbiity-pena-2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-maternal-morbiity-pena-2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbiity-pena-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>“I know things went terribly wrong, but I also know I’m one of the lucky ones,” says Cindel Pena in Sacramento, California, who went to the ER with what she thought was a panic attack and was hospitalized for several days for heart failure.\n<span>(Max Whittaker for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Assuming that Pena was having a panic attack, the couple drove to the nearest hospital, Sutter Medical Center, where Pena asked for medication for anxiety, she said. Instead, she was hospitalized for a week. Her OB-GYN later diagnosed her with peripartum cardiomyopathy, a type of heart failure for which hypertension and obesity are risk factors.</p>\n<p>Pena has since recovered, and is now trying to decide whether to take the chance of having a second child. She has requested her medical records from the hospital both by phone and certified mail, without success. A hospital records staffer last week confirmed that it has not yet sent the records to Pena. A Sutter spokeswoman declined comment on Pena’s case, citing privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>Pre-existing conditions such as asthma, hypertension, diabetes and substance use have increased disproportionately among women in rural and low-income communities, according to <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Citation/2017/12000/Disparities_in_Chronic_Conditions_Among_Women.19.aspx\">a study by researchers</a> at the University of Michigan. Inadequate health insurance widens this gap. Medicaid, which pays for half of all U.S. births, covers many mothers only up to two months past delivery. As a result, for low-income women, pre-existing conditions that imperiled one delivery may go unseen and untreated until the next pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Black women experience life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth complications at much higher rates than white or Hispanic women — in part because they have higher rates of chronic disease and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth\">prolonged stress</a>. In Heather Lavender’s case, a different pre-existing condition —the after-effects of a prior uterine procedure — may have been a factor in her life-threatening complication.</p>\n<p>A critical-care nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, she had a history of troubled pregnancies: several miscarriages and the birth and death of a son at 18 weeks. Her doctors removed uterine tissue that they believed was causing the problem. Her final pregnancy, in 2014, proceeded without mishap until her 39th week, when her uterus ruptured, according to her medical records. Doctors performed an emergency hysterectomy. Her son Cruz died nine days later.</p>\n<p>“I feel like most of my life up until that point, I’m a pretty happy person, glass-half-full person,” she said recently from New Mexico, where she now works as a nurse for the Indian Health Service. “I’m not sure what I am now.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Not only do women today enter pregnancy in more compromised health, but the medical care they receive sometimes compounds the danger. When researchers have analyzed maternal deaths and near-deaths to understand what went wrong, one element they have noted time and again is what some experts have dubbed “delay and denial” — the failure of doctors and nurses to recognize a woman’s distress signals and other worrisome symptoms, both during childbirth and the often risky period that follows.</p>\n<p>Hospitalized for a postpartum infection at St. Francis Regional Medical Center in Shakopee, Minnesota, Jennifer Andrashko, 34, a clinical social worker, was about to be discharged when she told a nurse that she was having trouble taking a deep breath.</p>\n<p>The nurse later assured her that he had relayed a message to the doctor about Andrashko’s sense of “impending doom” and “worry.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-1.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-1.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-1.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-1.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-1.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Jennifer Andrashko with her baby, Cecelia. As a clinical social worker, Andrashko knew her nurse was wrong in assuming she was having a panic attack. <span>(Courtesy of Jennifer Andrashko)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Andrashko interrupted: “You’re describing criteria for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,” she recalled saying, “and I know that because I diagnose those things. But I don't have either of those things.”</p>\n<p>Yet the nurse held firm. “The doctor would like to take a holistic approach,” Andrashko said he replied. He offered Andrashko a lavender-scented foot rub, assuring her that it was free of charge. Andrashko accepted the rub, but when her breathing hadn’t improved by the next day, she complained again to her doctor.</p>\n<p>“It’s probably just acid reflux,” she said her doctor replied.</p>\n<p>Andrashko went home. Two days later, she returned to St. Francis to be treated for severe preeclampsia, life-threatening heart failure and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), medical records show. “The reason I was having trouble taking a deep breath was because my lungs were full of fluid,” she said. “I was not anxious, I was very sick.”</p>\n<p>After she recovered, Andrashko complained to the hospital. Anita Yund, a patient representative, informed her in a letter reviewed by ProPublica that the surgical station manager had acknowledged that “the nurse’s response could have been communicated in a more clear, reassuring manner. In follow up, the manager discussed this matter with nursing staff and has assured me that appropriate follow-up (sic) actions were taken.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-3.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-3.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-andrashko-3.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A nurse offered Jennifer Andrashko a lavender-scented foot rub for anxiety when she was actually suffering from fluid in the lungs and life-threatening heart failure. <span>(Courtesy of Jennifer Andrashko)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Asked by ProPublica to describe those actions, Yund said she couldn’t comment but would ask her manager to return the call. The manager never did.</p>\n<p>Doctors may delay and deny because obstetric emergencies are unusual and often unexpected. “By and large, pregnant women are going to do OK, almost no matter what you do, until they don’t,” said Main, the maternal-health reformer in California. “The large majority will do fine. That makes people assume, even in the light of symptoms, that with some time, the bleeding will stop, it’s going to be okay, I just have to wait it out a little longer.”</p>\n<p>This points to a related problem: Unlike in Great Britain, many U.S. hospitals have failed to put treatment protocols in place to help doctors and nurses act quickly before complications turn life-threatening. Protocols to treat blood loss — including having supply carts stocked with blood and conducting regular training and drills — have been shown to reduce the severity of hemorrhages <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/6/29/15830970/women-health-care-maternal-mortality-rate\">in California</a> and elsewhere. Patient safety groups, most notably the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, have drafted guidelines for the prevention and treatment of various complications, including hemorrhage, preeclampsia and blood clots. But the AIM program is still in its early stages. Some hospitals have been slow to adopt protocols, and some doctors have resisted what they see as intrusions on their discretion and professional judgment.</p>\n<p>Without protocols, chaos can prevail. “Having been in those situations, I’ve seen where the team just flails around, and the attending is just yelling at everybody and throwing instruments and you’re losing sponges and everything,” said <a href=\"https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/prevention-and-community-health-office-dean/michael-lu\">Dr. Michael Lu</a>, a dean at George Washington University’s school of public health, and former <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/\">Health Resources and Services Administration</a> associate administrator for maternal and child health. “Versus something that’s completely orchestrated where everybody knows exactly what he or she is supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While some caregivers faced with troubled pregnancies or births do too little, others do too much. Maternal safety advocates describe a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/pregnancy-childbirth/childbirth-what-to-reject-when-youre-expecting/\">culture of intervention</a>, from inducing labor with drugs to performing <a href=\"https://news.aetna.com/2015/10/c-section-most-common-surgery-often-unnecessary/\">unnecessary C-sections</a>, as another important contributor to severe complications.</p>\n<p>The best available estimates are that more than one in five pregnant women now have their labor induced, which usually means they’re given medicine, such as Pitocin (a synthetic version of the natural hormone oxytocin), to stimulate uterine contractions. The rate of inductions <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2009/ACOG-Issues-Revision-of-Labor-Induction-Guidelines\">more than doubled</a> from 1990 to 2006, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n<p>Doctors may induce labor when they fear for the health of the mother or the baby. Yet sometimes the procedure is performed simply for a doctor’s or patient’s convenience. More than a decade ago, early elective inductions (before 39 weeks) had become so common and proved so risky for newborns that many hospitals have since banned them unless medically indicated.</p>\n<p>Inductions often lead to more prolonged labors, which can over-tax the uterus and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555986/\">raise the risk</a> of hemorrhages, Main said. “The uterus is a muscle, and there’s only so long it can contract,” he said.</p>\n<p>The greater danger, according to Main and others, has been a sharp rise in the rate of C-sections, now the most common type of in-patient surgery in U.S. hospitals. In the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1647267/?tool=pubmed\">less than 5 percent of all U.S. births were by C-section</a>. But in 2016, nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db287.htm\">one in three</a> women had the procedure. The U.S. rate is roughly twice that of Europe.</p>\n<p>C-sections, like any surgery, increase the likelihood of immediate complications, including hemorrhages, <a href=\"https://consumer.healthday.com/sexual-health-information-32/childbirth-health-news-126/c-section-raises-risk-of-blood-clots-after-childbirth-review-715258.html\">blood clots</a> and infections. They also raise the risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies. As a result, once a woman has the surgery, many doctors and hospitals are reluctant to deliver her next child vaginally. Only recently has the downside of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16738145\">multiple C-sections</a> been fully recognized. Having more than one C-section can lead to placenta accreta, the potentially life-threatening condition in which the placenta attaches abnormally to the uterine wall and sometimes grows through it. In the 1950s and ‘60s, when C-sections were uncommon, placenta accreta occurred once in 30,000 births. Now, said Terlizzi, the <a href=\"https://preventaccreta.org/\">National Accreta Foundation</a> cofounder, the incidence is one in 333 births. The complication is so dangerous that the treatment team often includes doctors and nurses from eight to 10 specialties; the vast majority of cases lead to hysterectomies.</p>\n<p>Only about one-third of U.S. C-sections are medically justified, according to Declercq, the Boston University maternal health expert. A web of factors explains the rest, including hospital culture (C-section rates vary <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Cesarean+delivery+rates+vary+tenfold+among+US+hospitals%3B+reducing+variation+may+address+quality+and+cost+issues\">widely</a> from one institution to the next); the convenience factor (C-sections can be scheduled); and indirect <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/08/30/216479305/money-may-be-motivating-doctors-to-do-more-c-sections\">financial</a> incentives. Because C-sections normally take much less time than vaginal deliveries, they are more cost effective for hospitals and providers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, several studies point to the influence of “defensive medicine,” when doctors perform unnecessary procedures or treatments for fear of being blamed for not doing enough if something goes wrong.</p>\n<p>A 2010 <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/default/files/media-browser/public/health-policy/prp-201001-claim-freq.pdf\">survey</a> by the American Medical Association found that half of OB-GYNs had been sued before the age of 40 — a higher proportion than doctors in most other medical fields. In an industry <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2009/ACOG_Releases_2009_Medical_Liability_Survey\">survey</a> in 2009, nearly 30 percent of OB-GYNs said their fear of lawsuits led them to operate more often than they otherwise would have done.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The fear that drives OB-GYNs to perform C-sections is that they’ll be sued for failing to do enough to protect the baby — not the mother. Lawsuits by mothers who suffered complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are rare, and — lawyers say — usually futile.</p>\n<p>Even the first step — finding a lawyer — poses a formidable hurdle. In a medical malpractice suit, harm such as the loss of a uterus through an emergency hysterectomy would normally fall into the category of “pain and suffering.” About half of states have capped legal damages under that heading; in at least a dozen, including California, Colorado and Texas, the maximum is $350,000 or less. That’s rarely enough to entice lawyers who have to spend time and money up front to hire experts and investigate what happened.</p>\n<p>Thus, to make a case truly attractive to a lawyer, plaintiffs must be able to prove they’ve suffered economic damages such as lost wages or long-term medical costs — an argument that’s all but impossible in the case of harm to reproductive organs, said Lucinda Finley, a University of Buffalo law professor who has <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=898863\">researched</a> the impact of tort law on women.</p>\n<p>“What is the value of a uterus, unless a woman makes her living with it?” Finley asked. “What is the value of fertility for a woman of childbearing age and aspirations? Unfortunately our society says in many different ways and contexts that the value is minimal, which I think is extremely demeaning and devaluing of women.”</p>\n<p>In contrast, a lawsuit over serious harm to a baby would likely yield far more: Parents might hope to collect economic damages to help pay to care for the baby into adulthood, and even provide for that baby’s potential lost wages.</p>\n<p>Even women who suffer devastating long-term disability may face daunting legal challenges, as Rebecca Derohanian’s family has discovered. Derohanian, now 36, a native of Iran, was a vendor manager for Warner Brothers, with a hobby designing remarkably lifelike dolls. Her husband, Hungarian-born Zoltan Csizmadia, worked in information technology.</p>\n<p>She became pregnant with her second child in 2014. Doctors discovered that her unborn daughter was small for her gestational age and recommended a C-section. Forty hours after the surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, as Derohanian was preparing to go home, she complained of a severe headache; within 10 minutes, she screamed in agony and passed out, according to family members. She spent the next four months in a coma, transferred from hospital to hospital. In July 2015, as nurses were attending to her, Derohanian regained a semblance of consciousness. “She sneezed and said, ‘sorry,’ and we couldn't believe what we heard,” her husband said.</p>\n<p>But the excitement and hope soon faded. “It became apparent that some of the emotional regions of the brain were affected, so she wasn’t the same person really,” Csizmadia said. Physical and speech therapy only accomplished so much. She couldn’t walk or eat without assistance, so her family transferred her to a nursing home.</p>\n<p>Csizmadia’s sister, Christine Roseland, an attorney, thought that going to court might help her brother cope with his wife’s medical bills, including hefty copays and deductibles, plus 20 percent of the costs of the nursing home.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-derohanian-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-derohanian-2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-derohanian-2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-derohanian-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Rebecca Derohanian and her husband, Zoltan Csizmadia, in an undated photograph.\n<span>(Courtesy of Zoltan Csizmadi)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>She felt a case could be made for lost wages, if only she could get a clear answer on what had gone wrong. Hospital officials told family members that they had conducted a case review, Roseland said. But Derohanian’s family was barred from discovering the results. Under a legal concept known as “peer review privilege,” the findings of hospital peer-review committees that examine medical errors cannot be used in litigation. Some version of this rule is in effect in all 50 states. The law’s goal is to encourage hospitals to learn from their mistakes without fear of being punished. But the result may be that families are left in the dark.</p>\n<p>Derohanian’s doctors at Cedars-Sinai told her family that she had suffered a subdural hematoma, a traumatic brain bleed that rarely occurs in childbirth. But the medical team never provided a clear explanation of how or why. “If it were your mom, your sister or your wife, would you be OK with that answer? Would that be enough for you to move on?” Roseland asked. “I think for a lot of people, it wouldn’t be.”</p>\n<p>A hospital spokeswoman declined comment, citing patient confidentiality.</p>\n<p>Roseland interviewed more than a dozen lawyers before finding one who would file a suit, which is now pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Jason Argos was among those who turned her down. The malpractice attorney spent nearly \\$4,000 on experts to review Derohanian’s medical records, but their conclusion — that the brain bleed was likely related to a problem with Derohanian’s anesthesia — wasn’t clear-cut enough to be worth the gamble.</p>\n<p>“Rebecca’s case is hands-down the most tragic one to ever to come across my desk,” Argos said. “I hated to walk away from it.”</p>\n<p>Had Derohanian died, Argos said, it probably would have been easier to determine whether someone was to blame. The hospital would have had to do an autopsy or let the family hire a forensic pathologist for that purpose. Yet when a woman nearly dies, doctors are under no formal obligation — beyond providing medical records — to tell patients and their families what occurred. “It’s almost impossible to get answers or hold anyone accountable,” Csizmadia said. Derohanian, he said, “has almost been forgotten.”</p>\n<p>Samantha Blackwell considered a lawsuit over her coma and hysterectomy. She and her mother “interviewed every lawyer between Columbus and Cleveland,” she said. Yet no attorney would take the case. They all said more or less the same thing: Finding someone to blame for Blackwell’s injuries would be too hard. Her doctors, they told Blackwell, “could’ve said it was just a series of unfortunate events.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-inline-2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-inline-2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-inline-2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-inline-2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171222-maternal-morbidity-inline-2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>\n<span>Kasia Bogdanska, special to ProPublica</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>These complications, many of them preventable, impose a financial burden on women, their families, and the health care system. Kristen Terlizzi’s care for her placenta accreta case in 2014 cost almost $1.2 million, which was covered by her private insurance. Blackwell’s medical bills topped $400,000, a cost borne largely by her mother’s insurance. Still, she and her husband weren’t completely spared. Blackwell was unable to work for six months, and the couple is fighting a $30,000 charge from the private helicopter company that flew Blackwell between hospitals.</p>\n<p>Several maternal health experts told ProPublica that no researcher or agency has yet calculated the total cost of severe maternal morbidity. Yet the available data suggests it amounts to billions of dollars every year. The cost alone of caring for mothers with preeclampsia exceeds $1 billion annually, according to a <a href=\"http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(17)30561-6/fulltext\">September 2017 report</a> in the American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. In 2011, Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, paid more than $210 million to treat <a href=\"http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/publications/Documents/PDF/maternalhemorrhagereport-oct2013.pdf\">maternal hemorrhage</a> and <a href=\"http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/publications/Documents/PDF/gestationaldisordersreport-oct2013.pdf\">hypertensive disorders</a>, both among the leading conditions associated with childbirth complications.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the average cost of a hysterectomy related to complications of childbirth was more than $95,000, according to information provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars a year for all emergency hysterectomies.</p>\n<p>None of these estimates begins to include the other very real costs borne by women and families — psychological trauma and treatment, lost wages and long-term health effects. Whatever the exact price tag, the impact on women of life-threatening complications from childbirth “is financially, emotionally, medically, spiritually life-changing,” said Miranda Klassen, a <a href=\"https://www.afesupport.org/\">maternal health advocate</a> who almost died in 2008 from an amniotic fluid embolism — the entry of amniotic fluid into the bloodstream, triggering heart and lung failure.</p>\n<p>“The pain and suffering is exponential. It’s not just the moms, it’s the spouses, it’s the parents, it’s the children, it’s the larger family and community … It completely turns your world upside down.”</p>\n<p>NPR special correspondent Renee Montagne contributed to this report.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7809019.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <span>Dan Alexander</span>, Forbes, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/derek-kravitz\">Derek Kravitz</a>, ProPublica </p>\n<p>The chief of staff for Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Wendy Teramoto, still owns a stake in a shipping company tied to associates of Vladimir Putin, despite the fact that her former role as a board member for the same company prompted six Senate Democrats to request an investigation into her apparent conflicts of interest last month.</p>\n<p>“We have not been notified, nor are we aware, of a formal investigation by the inspector general,” Commerce Department spokesperson James Rockas said in a statement. “But we continue to answer any questions that are raised by department ethics officials or the inspector general.” The statement said that Teramoto has recused herself from any matters relating to her investments. (The same senators also requested an investigation of Ross, who initially retained an estimated $3.4 million stake in the company, Navigator Holdings, but has since sold it.)</p>\n<p>As long as Teramoto hangs onto her own investments, she will likely remain under scrutiny, especially since there is evidence that her official actions are affecting the shipping industry, in which she is heavily invested.</p>\n<p>Teramoto previously worked for Ross at his private equity firm WL Ross &amp; Co. She invested in funds that held Navigator stock, as well as owning shares directly, and also served on the board of the shipping company from 2014 to July 2017. From 2014 to 2016, Navigator did $68 million worth of business with a Russian petrochemicals company named Sibur. That company is partially owned by two billionaires in Putin’s inner circle, Kirill Shamalov and Gennady Timchenko.</p>\n<p>In its annual report filed in March, Navigator said Teramoto directly owned $118,000 of the company’s stock. The Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed that Teramoto had not sold her Navigator stake or interests in WL Ross funds that held other shipping companies, such as Diamond S. Shipping.</p>\n<p>One of the most valuable assets listed on Teramoto’s financial disclosure form, which she filed in July, is her carried interest — a cut of the managers’ profits — in a fund called WLR Recovery Fund IV, which she valued at between $1 million and $5 million. An examination of that holding demonstrates how easily Teramoto’s portfolio could pose conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>WLR Recovery Fund IV counts Navigator, as well as other shipping interests, among its holdings. It also includes investments such as Amalgamated Bank and Exco Resources. Another entity in which Teramoto is invested, WLR Recovery Associates V, includes additional positions in shipping companies, as well as a stake in the Russia-connected Bank of Cyprus.</p>\n<p>If those funds perform well, they will make up a significant chunk of Teramoto’s net worth. In total, she listed personal net assets worth $6 million to $19.3 million on the disclosure.</p>\n<p>Although it is legal for Teramoto to own assets — even ones like Navigator that present potential conflicts of interest — while she serves in the government, she cannot participate in decisions that would clearly affect her holdings. “[With] any asset, the question is what you’re doing in the Commerce Department,” said Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. “Is there a direct and predictable effect on any of your financial holdings? If it does, you commit a crime.”</p>\n<p>Teramoto’s role inside the Commerce Department — and when she signed on — remains a bit of a mystery. In May, Ross referred to her as his chief of staff in a taped interview with Bloomberg, at a time when the Department of Commerce now claims she was not yet a full-time employee. Two months later, Teramoto filed a financial disclosure report listing her position as a “senior advisor.” A spokesperson for the Commerce Department said Sunday that she did not become chief of staff until Aug. 1. “The Secretary must have misspoken,” the spokesperson said, when informed that Ross had publicly called her his chief of staff three months earlier.</p>\n<p>The timing of her official employment with the Commerce Department is all the more critical given that Teramoto remained on the board of the private company until July; it raises the possibility that she was a high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Commerce at the same time she was on the board of a company doing business with Russians.</p>\n<p>In the same taped interview, Ross credited Teramoto with doing much of the work on a trade deal with China that affected, among other things, shipments of liquefied natural gas. That comment raised eyebrows because Navigator transports gas products. Its ships, however, are incapable of transporting liquefied natural gas, according to a company spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Even before the most recent revelations, the six Senate Democrats who requested an investigation — Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois — expressed their concern with the overlapping responsibilities in their November letter to the inspector general of the Commerce Department: “These reports about a clear and compelling conflict of interest make us question whether efforts are focused on her personal business interests or the well-being of the American people.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7800360.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ginger-thompson\">Ginger Thompson</a> </p>\n<p>At about 2 a.m. on April 21, 2010, a convoy of gunmen working for the Zetas drug cartel, one of the most violent drug trafficking organizations in the world, rolled into Monterrey, Mexico, a wealthy, bustling city considered that country’s commercial capital. With brazen efficiency, they set up roadblocks at all major thoroughfares, then sent a convoy of sport utility vehicles downtown, encircling a Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>The heavily armed men, some wearing ski masks, swarmed into the hotel’s lobby and rushed directly to the fifth floor, bursting into every room and rousting the guests from their beds. The gunmen questioned the guests, then separated four of them from the rest: a marketing executive at an eyewear company, a chemical engineer for a cosmetics manufacturer, a shoe salesman expecting his first child, and a college professor who was the mother of two.</p>\n<p>Then the four were loaded, along with the hotel’s receptionist, into the gunmen’s vehicles and driven away. None of the hostages has been seen since. All are presumed dead.</p>\n<p>For years, their relatives and friends begged for answers. Why were their loved ones — ordinary middle-class Mexicans with no known criminal ties—targeted in this spasm of drug violence? The marketing executive’s family futilely negotiated and paid a ransom before the Zetas cut off contact.</p>\n<p>“We could never figure out why they were taken. What made them so important?” said David Anabitarte, the marketing executive’s supervisor and one of his best friends. “It was hard to accept what had happened because it never made any sense.”</p>\n<p>Mexican authorities initially insinuated that the victims had brought on their own demise, adding insult to grief. The college professor, they alleged, may have been involved in a romantic relationship with one of the Zetas’ rivals. And they speculated that the marketing executive, who had managed to lift his family into the upper middle class, might have had some connection to the drug trade. Without any credible explanations for why the Zetas would move military-style through a major metropolitan city to kidnap random guests at a budget hotel, some of the people close to the victims began to believe that too.</p>\n<p>“I remember sitting silently as some of Luis’ own relatives said that he must have had a secret life,” Anabitarte recalled. “It was unbearable. I knew it wasn’t true.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, it wasn’t. And one law enforcement agency knew that for sure: the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. U.S officials describing for the first time what happened at the Holiday Inn said up until the day before the inexplicable kidnappings, the DEA had been running a surveillance operation out of the Holiday Inn. Staying at the hotel were several members of the Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU), a team of Mexican federal police officers specially trained and vetted by the DEA. The team had been working undercover, trying to track the movements of a Zetas leader named Hector Raul Luna, who was known as “El Tori.” But Luna found out about the operation and sent his gunmen to the Holiday Inn to shut it down.</p>\n<p>The DEA didn’t hang around to figure out how the tables had been so violently turned. It evacuated the SIU officers from Monterrey, and never looked back at the innocent people who weren’t so lucky. The agency never revealed its role in what had happened to either local or federal authorities. It didn’t offer to help investigate the incident, or to use its surveillance capabilities to track the kidnappers. Nor did it turn its scrutiny inward to figure out whether the intelligence leak that had drawn the Zetas to the Holiday Inn had come from within the SIU.</p>\n<p>The DEA’s connection to the Holiday Inn attack, which has not been previously reported, was not an isolated incident. A deeper look at the agency’s Mexican SIU has found a decade of problems that have cost people’s lives. In June, ProPublica and National Geographic published a detailed investigation of a 2011 massacre that occurred in and around a small Mexican ranching town called Allende, less than an hour’s drive from the Texas border. The rampage there, like that in Monterrey, was also carried out by the Zetas, and was sparked, ProPublica determined, by a leak of intelligence provided to the SIU.</p>\n<p>The Allende death toll, however, was far greater. Victims’ advocates say as many as 300 people are dead or missing. ProPublica found evidence of as many as 60.</p>\n<p>In addition, according to interviews with numerous current and former DEA agents, the SIU itself has been plagued by infiltrations and attacks. Since 2007, most of the unit’s Mexican supervisors have either been compromised by payoffs and bribes from various drug traffickers, or killed in ways that strongly suggest they were inside hits. One of the supervisors, Ivan Reyes Arzate, was indicted earlier this year in a federal court in Chicago on charges of sharing sensitive information with drug traffickers.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Ángel Montes de Oca, 39, had just gotten married when he was kidnapped from a Holiday Inn, in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2010. His family spent years looking for him, because his mother refused to accept he wasn’t coming home.\n<span>(Hector Emanuel, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In an interview, Reyes’ attorney strongly denied the charges against his client. The DEA however, had suspected for years that Reyes was dirty, as were other people in the SIU. But time after time the agency calculated that the benefits of the program outweighed the costs. And it has kept those costs secret from the Mexican families and American taxpayers that might disagree with that calculation.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t the DEA say anything?” asked the relative of one of the victims of the Holiday Inn attack. “With all their power and authority, why didn’t they try to help? I suppose Mexican lives don’t matter.”</p>\n<p>The DEA did not respond to a long list of questions about the findings in this story. Instead it emailed a brief statement: “The Sensitive Investigative Unit Program has proven to be an effective international program for supporting host nation counterdrug units capable of conducting international drug investigations. The agents supporting the program work bi-laterally with the host nation law enforcement institution.  DEA trains, mentors and supports vetted host nation law enforcement investigators that make up the Sensitive Investigative Units.”</p>\n<p>This examination of the DEA’s SIU program in Mexico is based on interviews with 23 current and former DEA agents who are deeply knowledgeable about the program, including several who served in senior positions. They would only speak on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing sensitive matters without the agency’s consent.</p>\n<p>“If this had happened in the States, there would have been all kinds of outrage,” said one former agent, referring to the incident at the Holiday Inn. “But in Mexico, I’m sorry to say this, nobody gives a shit.”</p>\n<h3>The Attack</h3>\n<p>Mexicans tout Monterrey, with over 4 million residents in the metropolitan area, as their country at its most modern. Surrounded by mountains in the northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, it’s the poster-place for free trade, with a per capita income far higher than the rest of the country and a semi-arid landscape dotted with golf courses, colleges and the Mexican headquarters for companies like BMW, Mercedes Benz, Boeing, General Electric and Heineken.</p>\n<p>But everything that makes Monterrey ideal for legitimate business—its access to major north-south highways and its proximity to the United States border—is equally attractive to the drug trade. In 2010, the Zetas had a lock on it.</p>\n<p>Founded by former Mexican military officers, the Zetas ran an extensive counter-intelligence system, with scouts and informants throughout the city, according to current and former DEA agents. The cartel also had sources at high levels of the Mexican federal police, including, it is believed, the SIU. One of those sources alerted the cartel about some suspicious activity at the Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>The DEA agents who spoke about the incident said it was unclear whether the Zetas were told that there were Mexican federal police officers at the hotel, or just that there were people who looked like law enforcement of some kind. Either way, the Zetas dispatched a group of gunmen to eliminate the perceived threat.</p>\n<p>But on this occasion, the cartel’s counter-intelligence capabilities only went so far. A day before the attack, unbeknownst to the gunmen, a logistical misstep had forced the members of the SIU to move to a different hotel. The SIU hadn’t reserved rooms at the Holiday Inn for enough days to cover the operation, and their rooms were no longer available.</p>\n<p>By the time the Zetas’ gunmen arrived, the SIU members were gone and the traffickers scooped up four guests that vaguely fit the same profile. When they discovered their mistake, the Zetas tried to extract a small win. One of the kidnappers telephoned Anabitarte later that same day to demand a ransom for his friend and employee, Luis Miguel González.</p>\n<p>“I knew it wasn’t a hoax, first of all, because they knew my name,” Anabitarte recalled. Then, he said, the kidnappers put González on the phone. “He told me, ‘Tell Zitlaly with an X that I love her.’”</p>\n<p>That was the code Gonzalez and Anabitarte had agreed to use if he ever got in trouble. Zitlaly was González’s wife. When asked why the men felt that such a code was necessary, Anabitarte deadpanned, “This is Mexico.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>David Anabitarte, a marketing executive, was initially reluctant to talk about the Holiday Inn incident. One of his best friends, Luis Miguel González, was kidnapped in the attack and is presumed dead. Authorities initially speculated that the victims had been targeted because they had something to do with the drug trade. That wasn’t true.\n<span>(Hector Emanuel, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Anabitarte wired the kidnappers the $3,000 they demanded. The next day, they asked for $140,000 more. The family said they needed a guarantee that González was still alive. Pay the money the kidnappers said, and González would be home by the weekend.</p>\n<p>The family deposited the money in a bank account as the kidnappers had instructed. But González was never released.</p>\n<p>“We made the decision, out of pain, or out of fear, or out of whatever you want to call it, to deposit the money without proof of life,” said Victor Béjar, one of the hostage’s uncles, through tears. “It was a mistake.”</p>\n<p>Béjar said he stayed in Monterrey for days, trying to reach the kidnappers, sending them texts, and leaving voicemail messages. “We did what you asked. Now it’s your turn,” he pleaded with them. “We want our nephew. His wife is pregnant.’”</p>\n<p>He added, “I don’t know what all I told them. But all I got was silence, total silence.”</p>\n<h3>A Decade of Trouble</h3>\n<p>When DEA agents in Monterrey and Mexico City learned about the attack on the Holiday Inn, they scrambled to get the SIU officers back to Mexico City as quickly as possible, according to current and former agents knowledgeable about the incident. The members of the unit were working undercover, but were hardly inconspicuous. Their accents and clothing made it clear they were from out of town, one agent said, and could easily have caught the attention of any hotel staff moonlighting as cartel scouts.</p>\n<p>Even more astonishing in hindsight, the SIU members used personal credit cards to secure their rental cars and hotel rooms, the agent said, so their identities wouldn’t have been hard to trace — an operational flaw that was mentioned in a 2010 assessment of the SIU program conducted by a private contractor.</p>\n<p>Other agents acknowledged, however, that the Zetas could have just as likely been tipped off by someone already on their payroll; either a mole inside the unit or a senior leader of the Mexican federal police. There was plenty of evidence by that time that the unit was leaky.</p>\n<p>Three years earlier, the SIU supervisor at the time had alerted the DEA that the Zetas were offering him huge bribes for information, and that he was afraid he was going to be killed for refusing them. In a meeting, Rubén Omar Ramirez told a senior DEA official that he would lay low for a while in hopes that the Zetas would eventually lose interest in him.</p>\n<p>He was killed the next day. A former DEA official knowledgeable about the murder said that Ramirez was at an SIU safe house in Mexico City when he was summoned to a meeting with commanders of the Mexican federal police’s anti-drugs division. On the way to the meeting, two gunmen on motorcycles intercepted his vehicle and opened fire.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>News reports indicate Ramirez, a 47-year-old father of three, was hit at least three times. “It looked like an inside job,” said the former DEA official. “He was called to that meeting by someone he thought he could trust.”</p>\n<p>Ramirez’s successor at the SIU didn’t fare any better. Roberto Velazco Bravo, a slight, bespectacled husband and father with a degree in psychology, was assassinated outside his home in May 2008, seven months after taking over as SIU supervisor. According to DEA records, Velazco, 36, had “directly participated in investigations that succeeded in locating Arturo Beltrán Leyva, and identifying other parts of the structure of his criminal organization, including his brother, Alfredo.”</p>\n<p>After Ramirez and Velazco were killed, another senior Mexican federal police official who helped oversee the SIU, Victor Gerardo Garay, was fired from the federal police department on charges of corruption. A senior DEA official who worked in Mexico at the time said the agency had caught Garay on wiretaps seeking bribes from Colombian drug traffickers. The senior official said that an SIU member named Edgar Enrique Bayardo agreed to testify against Garay, and was put into protective custody in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Garay spent four years in prison, but eventually was acquitted of the charges against him. Bayardo, however, was assassinated at his favorite Starbucks in Mexico City in 2009. Current and former DEA officials knowledgeable about his killing said that he, like Ramirez, had been summoned to the coffee shop by a phone call from someone he thought he could trust.</p>\n<p>Ivan Reyes Arzate took over as supervisor of the SIU in March 2010. The Zetas’ attacked the Holiday Inn one month later. It’s unclear whether the two events are connected. The charges filed in Chicago against Reyes say he accepted bribes from traffickers allied with the Beltrán Leyva brothers. The DEA suspects the brothers had ordered the murders of the previous SIU supervisors. In addition, the Beltran Leyva brothers were allied with the Zetas.</p>\n<p>“The fact that Reyes is still alive, and both of his predecessors are dead, that’s not a coincidence,” said one U.S. agent who had worked with Reyes in Mexico. “There’s a reason for that.”</p>\n<h3>All the Tools in the World</h3>\n<p>Maria Teresa Sánchez, 69, has spent years trying to figure out why the Zetas would have kidnapped her son, Ángel Montes de Oca, from the Holiday Inn. He was the fifth of her seven children; a 39-year-old chemical engineer who worked for a company that made cosmetics and personal hygiene products, like hand sanitizer. It was his first steady job, after years unsuccessfully trying to make a go of a small chain of shaved ice stores called Hawaiian Paradise. He had just gotten married, finally feeling financially stable enough to support a family of his own. And he had traveled to Monterrey for business meetings.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know what to say, or what to do,” Sánchez, 69, said, recalling how she felt when she first learned her son had been kidnapped. “I didn’t believe it. Why would anyone kidnap my son? We don’t have any money. We weren’t involved in anything.”</p>\n<p>Her daughter, Beatriz Montes de Oca, a 44-year-old physician, said, “I was looking for some kind of common denominator among the victims that might explain why they were taken and others were not. Was it their ages? Was it something about their room numbers?</p>\n<p>“Usually people get kidnapped because they’re selling drugs, or because they were friends with the wrong person,” she added, “but that wasn’t the case with these people. There had to be some kind of confusion. I just couldn’t figure out what it was.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Beatriz Montes de Oca and her mother Maria Teresa Sánchez met with countless local, state and federal Mexican authorities, pressing them to find their missing loved one.\n<span>(Hector Emanuel, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Mexican authorities only added to the confusion, she said, with constantly shifting lines of investigation that never led anywhere, or even made much sense. The authorities theorized that the kidnapping could be part of some twisted recruitment scheme, saying that the Zetas had been known to kidnap people with special skills, like accountants and computer programmers, then force them to work for the cartel or be killed.</p>\n<p>As more time passed, the police suggested that the attack was simply a way to demonstrate the Zetas’ strength to any potential rivals, and they warned the relatives of those missing that the mutilated bodies of their loved ones might appear dangling from a highway overpass or splayed in a public square.</p>\n<p>“My mother watched television all the time. And she would call me if she heard that four bodies had been found somewhere, or that four hostages had been rescued,” Beatriz Montes de Oca remembered. “I was like the family command center. She’d call me with reports, and I would investigate.”</p>\n<p>“It went on that way for years. Little by little, I began to say to her, ‘Perhaps you shouldn’t watch so much television.’”</p>\n<p>The one thing that never occurred to the two women was that the United States had played a role in what happened at the Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>“I’m sad. I’m very angry,” Beatriz Montes de Oca said, when told of the DEA’s involvement. She mentioned that she had read the ProPublica/National Geographic account of what happened in Allende a year after the attack on the Holiday Inn. “How could they make the same mistake twice? I don’t understand.”</p>\n<p>Her mother said, “They have all the tools in the world.”</p>\n<p>Current and Former DEA agents said the agency did very little to investigate what had happened at the Holiday Inn. Agents posted in and around Monterrey questioned their confidential sources without sharing the role played by the SIU. Officials said the informants either had not heard about the kidnappings or didn’t want to talk about them. The DEA had long suspected that authorities in Monterrey were taking bribes from the Zetas, and the audaciousness of the raid only hardened those suspicions. So, agents said, the DEA didn’t think it wise to discuss the incident with them.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t want to heighten our exposure,” a former U.S. agent said. “As far as DEA was concerned, we just wanted to stay in the background.”</p>\n<p>One current DEA agent blamed the crazy pace of events in Mexico at the time. The year of the Holiday Inn attack was the deadliest of the Mexican drug war. Top politicians and police were being killed indiscriminately. Massacres seemed as routine as robberies. The Mexican president at the time, Felipe Calderon, was struggling to keep his country on board with the effort, telling them the fight was costly but winnable. And the United States was preaching the same.</p>\n<p>“So much was happening at the time, that you couldn’t stop,” the agent recalled. “You just moved on to the next thing. The pace, it was off the charts.”</p>\n<p>Some current and former agents also noted that the Mexican government historically had not welcomed U.S. encroachments on its sovereignty, and may have resisted any DEA investigation. That argument seems less convincing when considering how aggressively the DEA has pursued Mexican criminals linked to killings of American law enforcement agents, like Jaime Zapata, who was shot to death in early 2011 in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. Under intense DEA pressure and direction, Mexican authorities had arrested the primary suspects in that murder, who were also members of the Zetas cartel, within 12 days.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>When Maria Teresa Sánchez learned about the DEA’s role in her son’s kidnapping, she wondered why the agency didn’t do anything to help find him. “They have all the tools in the world,” she said.\n<span>(Hector Emanuel, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>One former agent expressed regret about how the agency handled the Holiday Inn attack. “Something should have been done,” he said. “I told my boss about it. All he said was, ‘Let’s get our guys out of there.’ But as far as what happened to those families, I wasn’t given any direction about them.”</p>\n<p>Another agent said that, unlike other U.S. law enforcement agencies, the DEA does not require its field offices to conduct internal reviews of any investigations that result in loss of life. “We don’t have that at DEA,” he said. “As long as I’ve been at the agency, I’ve never known them to have such a thing. And on the occasions we have done that, it hasn’t gone well. What you get is people trying to cover things up.”</p>\n<h3>Working in Mexico</h3>\n<p>Earlier this year, some 14 Democratic members of Congress expressed their concerns about the DEA’s SIU program in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. That letter was prompted by ProPublica’s reporting on the massacre in Allende, and by a report by the Justice Department Inspector General about a DEA-led operation in Honduras that left four civilians dead. Since then, current and former agents said, the DEA has made some moves to strengthen its oversight of the SIU in Mexico and the 12 other countries where the agency operates such units. For example, it has moved the SIU’s Mexico City headquarters closer to the American embassy to improve the DEA’s ability to oversee and mentor the members of the unit. </p>\n<p>Last week, the DEA distributed a 54-page SIU manual. Current and former agents said it marked the first time in the 20 years since the SIU program began that the agency had put rules for running the units in writing—including everything from what to do when a member of the unit fails a polygraph to how to disseminate sensitive information and handle operations in which members of the SIU are killed.</p>\n<p>Some current and former agents defended the program, pointing out that with corruption endemic in Mexican institutions, it’s naïve to think that the DEA, with random polygraphs and occasional training, could keep their SIU completely clean. And they noted that the unit had helped capture significant trafficking targets over the years. Reyes, they said, was a textbook example of the tangled complexities of Mexican law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Former drug traffickers who agreed to cooperate with the DEA told the agency as early as 2011 that Reyes had acted as a “bagman,” for the Beltran Leyva brothers, collecting millions of dollars in cash for himself and his bosses on the police force. The former SIU commander was known to own an exotic sports car and a sailboat on an annual salary in 2011 of about $80,000, according to an agent who knew him then. And his girlfriend, who was also a member of the SIU, made no secret of her penchant for luxury designer shoes and handbags.</p>\n<p>But the agents said they never had enough evidence to have Reyes arrested. And U.S. officials worried they would harm other important security programs if they asked the Mexican Federal Police Chief to fire such a prominent commander.</p>\n<p>“Reyes was put there by the people above him for a reason,” one agent said. “We couldn’t ask them to remove him without explaining why. And even if they had removed him, they would have put in someone else just like him.”</p>\n<p>Still, Reyes did some good while running the SIU. Most notably, he helped capture a kingpin known Edgar “La Barbie” Valdez Villarreal in 2010 — a major victory. Though that coup was later tainted when DEA received credible intelligence that Reyes was acting on behalf of the Beltrán Leyva cartel, which had offered him $1 million to get Valdez, its archrival, off the streets.</p>\n<p>“When you work as an agent in Mexico, all you can do is work around the rumors and suspicions, especially when management isn’t willing or able to effectuate change,” said one current agent. “At some point you’re told, you have to work with what you’ve got.”</p>\n<h3>The Unopened Box</h3>\n<p>An unopened DHL box contains all that Anabitarte has left of his best friend, Luis Miguel González. The box contained clothing and other personal items that had been left in González’s room at the Holiday Inn, and the hotel had sent it to the eyewear company after the kidnapping. The box had been left in a storage room at the company. Anabitarte had forgotten about it, until a janitor asked whether it should be thrown away. Coincidentally, a reporter called him that same day to talk to him about what happened at the Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>Anabitarte didn’t call back right away, reluctant to reopen a deep emotional wound and frightened that discussing the kidnapping might provoke those responsible for it. Weeks later, he agreed to meet, insisting on a public place. And he brought the box.</p>\n<p>In an underground parking garage beneath a glitzy Mexico City department store, Anabitarte pulled the box from the back of his Land Rover. His hands shook and his eyes welled as he opened the flaps. He rifled nervously through the contents, as if he was wondering whether he was doing the right thing.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>David Anabitarte rifled nervously through a box that contains all he has left of his best friend, Luis Miguel González.

He owed it to his friend, he said, to keep searching for the truth of what had happened.</p>\n<p>“If the DEA knew what was behind all of this,” he asked, “why did they remain silent and allow so many innocent families to suffer?”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7799575.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\npor <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ginger-thompson\">Ginger Thompson</a> </p>\n<p>Sobre las 2 de la mañana del 21 de abril, 2010, una caravana de pistoleros del cartel de la droga de los Zetas, una de las organizaciones de narcotráfico más violentas del mundo, entró en Monterrey, México, una ciudad próspera y bulliciosa que es considerada la capital comercial del país. Con descarada eficacia, establecieron retenes en todas las vías principales antes de enviar un convoy de vehículos todoterreno al centro de la ciudad para rodear un Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>Un enjambre de hombres fuertemente armados, algunos enmascarados, tomaron por asalto el lobby del hotel y corrieron directamente al quinto piso, reventando las puertas de cada cuarto y arrastrando a los huéspedes de sus camas. Los pistoleros interrogaron a los huéspedes, y después separaron a cuatro de ellos del resto: un ejecutivo de marketing de una empresa de productos ópticos, un ingeniero químico de una fábrica de cosméticos, un vendedor de zapatos que iba a ser padre por primera vez, y una profesora de universidad que era madre de dos hijos.</p>\n<p>A continuación, los cuatro fueron metidos con el recepcionista del hotel en los vehículos de los pistoleros y se los llevaron. Ninguno de los rehenes ha sido visto desde entonces. Se presume que todos están muertos.</p>\n<p>Durante años, sus parientes y amigos rogaron por respuestas. ¿Por qué se convirtieron en objetivos sus seres queridos — mexicanos de clase media sin vínculos conocidos con el crimen — en este espasmo de violencia del narcotráfico? La familia del ejecutivo de marketing negoció y pagó un rescate inútilmente antes de que los Zetas cortaran contacto.</p>\n<p>“Nunca pudimos descubrir porque fueron secuestrados. ¿Qué les hizo tan importantes?” dijo David Anabitarte, el supervisor y buen amigo del ejecutivo de marketing. “Fue difícil aceptar lo que pasó porque nunca tuvo sentido.”</p>\n<p>Las autoridades mexicanas insinuaron inicialmente que las víctimas habían sido de alguna forma responsables de sus propias desapariciones, agregando insulto al dolor. La profesora de universidad, alegaron, podía haber estado involucrada en un romance con uno de los rivales de los Zetas. Y las autoridades especularon que el ejecutivo de marketing, quien había logrado ascender a su familia a la clase media alta, podría haber tenido alguna conexión con el narcotráfico. Sin ninguna explicación creíble acerca de porque los Zetas harían un despliegue de estilo militar en una importante ciudad metropolitana para secuestrar huéspedes al azar en un hotel económico, alguna gente cercana a las víctimas empezó a creer eso también.</p>\n<p>“Me acuerdo de estar sentado callado mientras algunos de los propios parientes de Luis decían que debía haber tenido una vida secreta,” recordó Anabitarte. “Fue inaguantable. Yo sabía que no era verdad.”</p>\n<p>Efectivamente, no era verdad. Y una agencia de las fuerzas de seguridad lo sabía con certeza: la DEA, la administración antidrogas de Estados Unidos. Describiendo por primera vez lo que pasó en el Holiday Inn, funcionarios de Estados Unidos dijeron que hasta el día anterior a los inexplicables secuestros, la DEA había estado haciendo un operativo de vigilancia desde el Holiday Inn. Varios miembros de la Unidad de Investigaciones Sensibles (SIU en inglés), un equipo de policías federales mexicanos especialmente seleccionados y entrenados por la DEA, se habían hospedado en el hotel. El equipo había estado trabajando de forma encubierta, intentando rastrear los movimientos de un jefe de los Zetas llamado Hector Raúl Luna, conocido como “El Tori.” Pero Luna se percató del operativo y mandó a sus pistoleros al Holiday Inn para acabar con ello.</p>\n<p>La DEA no se quedó a descifrar cómo se habían tan violentamente volteado las mesas. La agencia evacuó a los agentes de la SIU de Monterrey, y nunca miró atrás hacia la gente inocente que no tuvo tanta suerte. La agencia nunca reveló su papel en lo que había pasado ni a las autoridades locales ni a las federales. No ofreció ayuda para investigar el incidente, o usar sus capacidades de vigilancia para buscar a los secuestradores. Ni dirigió un escrutinio interno para averiguar si la filtración de inteligencia que había traído a los Zetas al Holiday Inn había salido de dentro de la SIU.</p>\n<p>La conexión de la DEA al ataque del Holiday Inn, que no había sido revelada hasta ahora, no fue un incidente aislado. Una revisión más profunda de la SIU mexicana que depende de la agencia ha encontrado una década de problemas que costaron vidas humanas. En junio, ProPublica y National Geographic publicaron una investigación detallada de una masacre en 2011 que ocurrió dentro y alrededor del pequeño pueblo ganadero de Allende, a menos de una hora en vehículo de la frontera de Texas. Tanto la matanza allí como la de Monterrey fueron perpetradas por los Zetas y fueron provocadas, ProPublica ha determinado, por filtraciones de inteligencia que había sido provista a la SIU.</p>\n<p>El número de muertos en Allende, sin embargo, fue mucho más grande. Los defensores de las víctimas dicen que hasta 300 personas están muertas o desaparecidas. ProPublica encontró pruebas de hasta 60 víctimas.</p>\n<p>Además, según entrevistas con numerosos agentes en activo o retirados de la DEA, la SIU misma ha estado plagada de infiltraciones y ataques. Desde 2007, la mayoría de los supervisores mexicanos de la unidad se han visto comprometidos por pagos o sobornos de varios narcotraficantes, o asesinados en circunstancias que indican fuertemente que se trata de traiciones resueltas desde dentro. Uno de los supervisores, Iván Reyes Arzate, fue acusado en una corte federal de Chicago a principio de este año de haber compartido información sensible con narcotraficantes.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP382-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Beatriz Montes de Oca, una doctora, pasó años buscando a su hermano, Ángel, que fue secuestrado en 2010 en un Holiday Inn en Monterrey. <span>(Hector Emanuel para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>En una entrevista, el abogado de Reyes negó enfáticamente las acusaciones contra su cliente. La DEA, sin embargo, había sospechado durante años que Reyes era corrupto, como lo era otra gente de la SIU. Pero una y otra vez la agencia calculó que los beneficios del programa compensaban los costos. Y ha mantenido estos costos ocultos a las familias mexicanas y a los contribuyentes americanos que podrían estar en desacuerdo con aquel cálculo.</p>\n<p>“¿Por qué no dijo nada la DEA?” preguntó un familiar de una de las víctimas del ataque al Holiday Inn. “Con todo su poder y autoridad, ¿por qué no intentaron ayudar? Supongo que las vidas mexicanas no importan.”</p>\n<p>La DEA no respondió a una larga lista de preguntas sobre los hallazgos de este reportaje. En cambio, emitió una breve declaración por correo electrónico: “El Programa de Investigaciones Sensibles ha demostrado ser un programa internacional eficaz para apoyar las unidades antidrogas del país anfitrión capaces de hacer investigaciones internacionales de droga. Los agentes que sustentan el programa trabajan bilateralmente con las fuerzas del orden del país anfitrión. La DEA entrena, aconseja y apoya a investigadores policiales seleccionados del país anfitrión que componen las Unidades de Investigaciones Sensibles.”</p>\n<p>Esta investigación periodística del programa de la SIU de la DEA en México está basada en entrevistas con 23 agentes y exagentes de la DEA que tienen un conocimiento profundo del programa, incluidos algunos que tuvieron puestos de alto nivel. Solo hablaron bajo la condición de anonimato porque estaban hablando de asuntos sensibles sin el permiso de la agencia.</p>\n<p>“Si esto hubiera pasado en Estados Unidos, habría habido todo tipo de indignación,” dijo un exagente en referencia al incidente en el Holiday Inn. “Pero en México, siento decirlo, a nadie le importa una mierda.”</p>\n<h3>El Ataque</h3>\n<p>Los mexicanos se jactan de Monterrey, con más de 4 millones de residentes en la zona metropolitana, como un ejemplo de lo más moderno de su país. Rodeada por montañas en el estado de Nuevo León al nordeste del país, es un lugar modelo para el libre comercio, con un ingreso per cápita muy por encima del resto del país y un paisaje semiárido poblado de campos de golf, universidades y las sedes mexicanas de empresas como BMW, Mercedes Benz, Boeing, General Electric y Heineken.</p>\n<p>Pero todo lo que hace a Monterrey ideal para el comercio legitimo — su acceso a grandes autopistas norte-sur y su proximidad a la frontera con Estados Unidos — es igualmente atractivo para el narcotráfico. En 2010, los Zetas lo dominaban.</p>\n<p>Fundado por exoficiales militares mexicanos, el cartel de los Zetas operaba un extenso sistema de contrainteligencia, con espías e informantes en toda la ciudad, según agentes y exagentes de la DEA. El cartel también tenía fuentes en altos niveles de la policía federal mexicana incluyendo, se cree, la SIU. Una de estas fuentes alertó al cartel sobre cierta actividad sospechosa en el Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>Los agentes de la DEA que hablaron del incidente dijeron que no está claro si se dijo a los Zetas que había policías federales mexicanos en el hotel, o solo que había gente que parecía ser de algún tipo de cuerpo policial. En todo caso, los Zetas desplegaron un equipo de pistoleros para eliminar la amenaza percibida.</p>\n<p>Pero en esta ocasión, las capacidades de contrainteligencia del cartel tuvieron un límite. Un día antes del ataque, sin el conocimiento de los pistoleros, un contrapié logístico había forzado a los miembros de la SIU a mudarse a un hotel diferente. La SIU no había reservado cuartos en el Holiday Inn por suficientes días para cubrir la duración del operativo, y sus cuartos ya no estaban disponibles.</p>\n<p>Para cuando los pistoleros de los Zetas llegaron, los miembros de la SIU se habían ido y los traficantes capturaron a cuatro huéspedes que vagamente encajaban en el mismo perfil. Cuando descubrieron su error, los Zetas intentaron sacar una pequeña ganancia. Uno de los secuestradores llamó por teléfono a Anabitarte aquel mismo día para exigir un rescate por su amigo y empleado, Luis Miguel González.</p>\n<p>“Yo sabía que no era un engaño, primero de todo porque sabían mi nombre,” Anabitarte rememoró. Entonces, dijo, los secuestradores pusieron a González al teléfono. “Me dijo, “Dígale a Zitlaly con una X que la quiero”.”</p>\n<p>Este era el código que González había acordado usar con Anabitarte si en algún momento se encontraba en apuros. Zitlaly era la esposa de González. Preguntado porque los hombres consideraban necesario usar tal código, Anabitarte dijo, impávido, “Esto es México.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP262-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>David Anabitarte, un ejecutivo de marketing, era inicialmente reticente a hablar del ataque al Holiday Inn.

No era cierto. <span>(Hector Emanuel para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Anabitarte envió por transferencia bancaria a los secuestradores los $3,000 que habían exigido.

Pero González nunca fue liberado.</p>\n<p>“Tomamos la decisión, por dolor, o por miedo, o por lo que quiera llamarlo, de depositar el dinero sin prueba de vida,” dijo Víctor Béjar, un tío del rehén, entre lágrimas. “Fue un error.”</p>\n<p>Béjar dijo que se quedó en Monterrey durante días, intentando contactar con los secuestradores, mandándoles mensajes de texto y dejando mensajes de voz. “Hicimos lo que pidieron. Ahora les toca a ustedes,” les rogó. “Queremos a nuestro sobrino. Su mujer está embarazada.”</p>\n<p>Añadió, “No sé todo lo que les dije. Pero solo recibí silencio, silencio total.”</p>\n<h3>Una Decada De Problemas</h3>\n<p>Cuando agentes de la DEA en Monterrey y Ciudad de México se enteraron del ataque contra el Holiday Inn, se aprestaron a llevar a los agentes de la SIU de vuelta a la Ciudad de México lo más rápido posible, según los agentes y exagentes que tienen conocimiento del incidente. Los miembros de la unidad estaban trabajando de forma encubierta, pero no pasaban exactamente desapercibidos. Sus acentos y sus vestimentas dejaban claro que eran de fuera, dijo un agente, y podrían fácilmente haber llamado la atención de cualquier trabajador del hotel pluriempleado como espía para el cartel.</p>\n<p>Aún más asombroso cuando es visto con el tiempo, los miembros de la SIU usaron sus tarjetas de crédito personales para reservar sus autos de alquiler y cuartos de hotel, dijo el agente, así que sus identidades no habrían sido difíciles de descubrir—un error operacional que fue mencionado en 2010 en una evaluación del programa SIU realizada por un contratista privado.</p>\n<p>Otros agentes reconocieron, sin embargo, que es igual de factible que los Zetas pueden haber recibido un soplo de alguien ya en su nómina; un topo dentro de la unidad o un alto jefe de la policía federal mexicana. Para entonces ya había mucha evidencia de que la unidad estaba infiltrada.</p>\n<p>Tres años antes, el supervisor de la SIU en aquella época había alertado a la DEA de que los Zetas le estaban ofreciendo enormes sobornos para conseguir información, y que él temía que lo iban a matar por rechazarles. En una reunión, Rubén Omar Ramirez dijo a un alto jefe de la DEA que se escondería por un rato con la esperanza de que los Zetas eventualmente perdieran interés en él.</p>\n<p>Lo mataron al día siguiente. Un ex funcionario de la DEA que conoce los datos del asesinato dijo que Ramirez estaba en una casa segura de la SIU en la Ciudad de México cuando fue llamado a una reunión con comandantes de la división antidrogas de la policía federal mexicana. En camino a la reunión, dos pistoleros en motocicletas interceptaron su vehículo y abrieron fuego.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Partes noticiosos del crimen indican que Ramirez, que tenía 47 años y tres hijos, recibió al menos tres impactos de bala. “Parecía un trabajo interno,” dijo el ex funcionario de la DEA. “Fue citado a la reunión por alguien de quien él pensaba que se podía fiar.”</p>\n<p>Al sucesor de Ramirez en la SIU no le fue nada mejor. Roberto Velazco Bravo, un marido y padre de aspecto menudo y lentes que era licenciado en psicología, fue asesinado en el exterior de su casa en mayo de 2008, siete meses después de asumir el puesto como supervisor de la SIU. Según archivos de la DEA, Velazco, 36, había “participado directamente en investigaciones que lograron localizar a Arturo Beltrán Leyva, e identificar otras partes de la estructura de su organización criminal, incluido su hermano, Alfredo.”</p>\n<p>Después de los asesinatos de Ramirez y Velazco, otro alto jefe de la policía federal mexicana quien ayudó a supervisar la SIU, Víctor Gerardo Garay, fue despedido de la agencia federal por cargos de corrupción. Un alto oficial de la DEA quien trabajaba en México en la época dijo que la agencia había detectado a Garay en llamadas interceptadas solicitando sobornos de narcotraficantes colombianos. El alto oficial dijo que un miembro de la SIU llamado Edgar Enrique Bayardo acordó testificar contra Garay, y fue puesto bajo custodia de protección en México.</p>\n<p>Garay estuvo cuatro años en prisión, pero fue finalmente absuelto de los cargos contra él. Bayardo, sin embargo, fue asesinado en frente de su Starbucks preferido en Ciudad de México en 2009. Agentes y exagentes de la DEA que conocen el caso dicen que él, como Ramirez, había sido citado en el café a través de una llamada de alguien de quien él pensaba que se podía fiar.</p>\n<p>Iván Reyes Arzate tomó el mando como supervisor de la SIU en marzo de 2010. Los Zetas atacaron el Holiday Inn un mes después. No está claro si los dos acontecimientos están relacionados. Los cargos criminales puestos en Chicago contra Reyes dicen que aceptó sobornos de traficantes aliados con los hermanos Beltrán Leyva. La DEA sospecha que los hermanos habían ordenado los asesinatos de los anteriores supervisores de la SIU. Además, los hermanos Beltrán Leyva eran aliados de los Zetas.</p>\n<p>“El hecho de que Reyes sigue vivo, y que sus dos predecesores están muertos, no es una coincidencia,” dijo un agente estadounidense que había trabajado con Reyes en México. “Hay una razón para eso.”</p>\n<h3>Todas Las Herramientas Del Mundo</h3>\n<p>María Teresa Sánchez ha pasado años intentando saber porque los Zeta secuestraron a su hijo, Angel Montes de Oca, en el Holiday Inn. Era el quinto de sus siete hijos; un ingeniero químico de 39 años que trabajaba para una empresa que fabricaba cosméticos y productos de higiene personal, como jabones de mano antisépticos. Era su primer trabajo fijo después de años en que había intentado poner en marcha una pequeña cadena de tiendas de granizados llamadas Paraíso Hawaiano. Acababa de casarse, finalmente sintiéndose lo suficiente estable en sus finanzas para mantener una familia. Y había viajado a Monterrey para reuniones de negocios.</p>\n<p>“No sabía que decir, o que hacer,” dijo Sánchez, de 69 años, recordando cómo se había sentido cuando se enteró de que su hijo había sido secuestrado. “No lo creía. ¿Por qué quisiera alguien secuestrar a mi hijo? No tenemos dinero. No estábamos involucrados en nada.”</p>\n<p>Su hija, Beatriz Montes de Oca, una médica de 44 años, dijo, “Estaba buscando algún denominador común entre las víctimas que pudiera explicar porque a algunos les habían llevado y a otros no. ¿Eran sus edades? ¿Era algo sobre los números de sus cuartos?”</p>\n<p>“Normalmente a la gente se les secuestra porque están vendiendo droga, o porque son amigos de la persona equivocada,” añadió, “pero esto no era el caso con esta gente. Tenía que haber algún tipo de confusión. No podía descifrar que era.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP137-3x2.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP229a-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Beatriz Montes de Oca y su madre María Teresa Sánchez se reunieron con un sinfín de autoridades locales, estatales y federales de México, presionándoles para encontrar a su familiar desaparecido. <span>(Hector Emanuel para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Las autoridades mexicanas solo aumentaron la confusión, dijo, con líneas de investigación que cambiaban todo el tiempo sin llegar a ninguna parte, y que tampoco tenían mucho sentido. Las autoridades teorizaban que el secuestro podría ser parte de un retorcido plan de reclutamiento, explicando que se sabía que los Zetas secuestraban a gente con habilidades especiales, como contables o programadores informáticos, para forzarles luego a trabajar para el cartel o ser asesinados.</p>\n<p>Mientras pasaba más tiempo, la policía sugirió que el ataque era simplemente una forma de demostrar la fuerza de los Zetas a cualquier rival potencial, y advirtieron a las familias de los desaparecidos que los cadáveres mutilados de sus seres queridos podrían terminar colgados del puente de una autopista o desparramados en una plaza pública.</p>\n<p>“Mi madre miraba la televisión todo el rato. Y me llamaba si se enteraba de que cuatro cadáveres habían sido descubiertos en algún lado, o que cuatro rehenes habían sido rescatados,” recordó Beatriz Montes de Oca. “Yo era como la unidad de mando operativo de la familia. Ella me llamaba con informes, y yo me ponía a investigar.”</p>\n<p>“Continuó así durante años. Poco a poco, empecé a decirle, “Quizás no tendrías que mirar tanta televisión.””</p>\n<p>La única cosa que nunca se les ocurrió a las dos mujeres era que los Estados Unidos había jugado un papel en lo que había pasado en el Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>“Estoy triste. Estoy muy enojada,” dijo Beatriz Montes de Oca cuando fue informada de la implicación de la DEA. Mencionó que había leído el reportaje de ProPublica y National Geographic sobre lo que había ocurrido en Allende un año después del ataque al Holiday Inn. “¿Cómo podían haber hecho el mismo error dos veces? No entiendo.”</p>\n<p>Su madre dijo, “Ellos tienen todas las herramientas del mundo.”</p>\n<p>Ninguno de los agentes de la DEA en activo ni retirados que fueron entrevistados recordó que la agencia hiciera mucho para investigar lo que había pasado en el Holiday Inn. Agentes basados en y alrededor de Monterrey interrogaron a sus fuentes confidenciales sin revelar el papel jugado por la SIU. Oficiales dijeron que los informantes no sabían de los secuestros o no querían hablar de ellos. La DEA había sospechado durante mucho tiempo que autoridades en Monterrey estaban recibiendo sobornos de los Zetas, y la temeridad del asalto solo fortalecía estas sospechas. Como consecuencia, según dijeron los agentes, la DEA no creyó que fuera prudente hablar del incidente con las autoridades.</p>\n<p>“No queríamos exponernos aún más,” dijo un exagente estadounidense. “En lo que concernía a la DEA, queríamos quedarnos en la sombra.”</p>\n<p>Un agente en activo de la DEA culpó al ritmo alocado de los acontecimientos en México en aquella época. El año del ataque al Holiday Inn fue el más mortífero de la guerra contra las drogas en México. Altos políticos y policías estaban siendo asesinados de forma indiscriminada. El presidente mexicano de la época, Felipe Calderón, estaba luchando para convencer a su país de seguir con el esfuerzo, diciendo que la batalla era costosa, pero se podía ganar. Y los Estados Unidos estaba predicando lo mismo.</p>\n<p>“Estaba pasando tanto en aquella época que simplemente no podías parar,” el agente dijo. “Pasabas a la siguiente cosa. El ritmo estaba fuera de control.”</p>\n<p>Algunos agentes y exagentes también comentaron que el gobierno mexicano históricamente no había recibido bien las incursiones de Estados Unidos en su soberanía, y podría haber resistido cualquier investigación de la DEA. Este argumento parece menos convincente teniendo en cuenta cuan agresivamente la DEA ha perseguido a criminales mexicanos vinculados a asesinatos de agentes de la ley americanos como Jaime Zapata, quien fue matado a tiros a principios de 2011 en el estado mexicano de San Luis Potosí. Bajo la intensa presión y dirección de la DEA, las autoridades mexicanas llegaron a arrestar a los principales sospechosos de aquel asesinato, quienes también eran miembros de los Zetas, en 12 días después del crimen.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP387-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Cuando María Teresa Sánchez se enteró del papel de la DEA en el secuestro de su hijo, se preguntó porque la agencia no hizo nada para ayudar a encontrarlo. “Tienen todas las herramientas en el mundo,” dijo. <span>(Hector Emanuel para ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Un exagente expresó su remordimiento por la forma en que la agencia manejó el caso del ataque al Holiday Inn. “Se tendría que haber hecho algo,” dijo. “Lo dije a mi jefe. Todo lo que dijo fue, “Saquemos a nuestros muchachos de allí.” Pero en lo que concierne a lo que pasó a aquellas familias, no me dieron ninguna directiva acerca de ellos.”</p>\n<p>Otro agente dijo que, a diferencia de otras agencias de la ley, la DEA no exige a sus oficinas sobre el terreno llevar a cabo revisiones internas de investigaciones que resultan en pérdidas de vida. “No tenemos esto en la DEA,” dijo. “En el tiempo que llevo en la agencia, nunca he sabido que tuvieran algo así. Y en las ocasiones que lo hemos hecho, no ha ido bien. Lo que consigues es gente intentando encubrir cosas.”</p>\n<h3>Trabajando en Mexico</h3>\n<p>A principios de año, unos 14 representantes Demócratas del Congreso expresaron su preocupación por el programa SIU de la DEA en una carta al Fiscal General Jeff Sessions y al Secretario de Estado Rex Tillerson. Aquella carta fue provocada por el reportaje de ProPublica sobre la masacre en Allende, y por un informe del Departamento de Justicia sobre un operativo liderado por la DEA en Honduras que dejó cuatro civiles muertos. Desde entonces, agentes y exagentes dijeron, la DEA ha tomado algunas medidas para fortalecer su supervisión de la SIU en México y los otros 12 países donde la agencia opera tales unidades. Por ejemplo, se ha mudado la sede de la SIU en la Ciudad de México más cerca de la embajada norteamericana para mejorar la capacidad de la DEA para supervisar y asesorar a los miembros de la unidad.</p>\n<p>La semana pasada, la DEA distribuyó un manual de 54 páginas sobre las SIU. Agentes y exagentes dijeron que era la primera vez en los 20 años desde que empezó el programa SIU que la agencia había establecido normas para manejar las unidades por escrito—incluyendo todo desde que hacer cuando un miembro de la unidad falla un examen polígrafo hasta como diseminar información sensible y llevar a cabo operaciones cuando miembros de la SIU son asesinados.</p>\n<p>Algunos agentes y exagentes defendieron el programa, advirtiendo que con la corrupción endémica en las instituciones mexicanas, sería inocente pensar que la DEA podía mantener su SIU completamente limpia usando pruebas de polígrafo aleatorias y ocasionales entrenamientos. Y señalaron que la unidad había ayudado a través de los años a capturar figuras del narcotráfico que fueron objetivos importantes. Reyes, dijeron, era un ejemplo de manual de las complejidades enrevesadas de las fuerzas de seguridad mexicanas.</p>\n<p>Ex narcotraficantes quienes acordaron cooperar con la DEA dijeron a la agencia tan pronto como en el 2011 que Reyes había actuado como un “cobrador” para los Beltrán Leyva, recaudando millones de dólares en efectivo para sí mismo y sus jefes en la fuerza policial. El antiguo comandante de la SIU era conocido por manejar un ostentoso auto deportivo y poseer un velero con un salario de aproximadamente $120,000. Y su novia, que también era agente de la SIU, no escondía su gusto por los zapatos y los bolsos lujosos de marca.</p>\n<p>Pero los agentes dijeron que nunca tuvieron suficientes pruebas para hacer arrestar a Reyes. Y oficiales de Estados Unidos estaban preocupados por el daño que podrían causar a otros programas importantes de seguridad si pidieran a la policía federal mexicana despedir a un comandante tan prominente.</p>\n<p>“Reyes había sido puesto allí por gente de más arriba por un motivo,” dijo un agente. “No podíamos pedirles sacarle sin explicar porque. Y aun si lo hubieran sacado, habrían colocado a alguien exactamente como él.”</p>\n<p>Sin embargo, Reyes hizo algunas cosas buenas mientras supervisaba la SIU. Más notablemente, ayudó a capturar a un conocido barón de la droga, Edgar “La Barbie” Valdez Villareal en 2010—un triunfo mayor. Aunque la hazaña fue contaminada posteriormente cuando la DEA recibió inteligencia fidedigna que Reyes estaba actuando en beneficio del cartel Beltrán Leyva, que le había ofrecido un millón de dólares para sacar a Valdez, su archirrival, de la calle.</p>\n<p>“Cuando trabajas como agente en México, todo lo que puedes hacer es trabajar esquivando los rumores y las sospechas, especialmente cuando la gerencia no es capaz o no está dispuesta a efectuar cambios,” dijo un agente en activo. “En algún momento te dicen vas a tener que trabajar con lo que tienes.”</p>\n<h3>La Caja Sin Abrir</h3>\n<p>Una caja de DHL sin abrir contiene todo lo que le queda a Anabitarte de su mejor amigo, Luis Miguel González. La caja contiene ropa y otros objetos personales que habían sido dejados en la habitación de González en el Holiday Inn, y el hotel la había enviado a la compañía de productos ópticos después del secuestro. La caja había sido olvidada en un cuarto de almacenaje en la oficina de Anabitarte en la Ciudad de México, hasta que un hombre de mantenimiento se la recordó recientemente. Irónicamente, una reportera le llamó aquel mismo día para hablar de lo que había pasado en el Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p>Anabitarte no devolvió la llamada enseguida, reacio a reabrir una profunda herida emocional y asustado por la idea de que hablar del secuestro podría provocar a los responsables. Semanas más tarde, aceptó tener una reunión, insistiendo en hacerlo en un sitio público. Y trajo la caja.</p>\n<p>En el garaje subterráneo debajo de unos grandes almacenes de lujo, Anabitarte sacó la caja de la parte de atrás de su Land Rover. Sus manos temblaron y sus ojos se llenaron de lágrimas mientras abría las hojas plegadizas de la caja. Repasó nerviosamente el contenido, como si se estuviera preguntando si estaba haciendo la cosa correcta.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP300-3x2.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-Emanuel_DF_PP288-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>David Anabitarte repasó nerviosamente el contenido de una caja que contiene todo lo que le queda de su mejor amigo, Luis Miguel González.

Se lo debía a su amigo, dijo, seguir buscando la verdad de lo que había pasado.</p>\n<p>“¿Si la DEA sabía lo que estaba detrás de todo esto,” preguntó, “por qué se quedaron callados y dejaron que tantas familias inocentes sufrieran?”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7799576.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <span>Ray Long</span>, Chicago Tribune, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jason-grotto\">Jason Grotto</a>, ProPublica </p>\n<p>Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios has never made any secret of his affinity for old-school politics that put a premium on loyalty and favors.</p>\n<p>That approach has served him well in the Cook County Democratic Party, where he’s risen to chairman, and at the ballot box, where he’s won two terms as assessor and next year will seek a third.</p>\n<p>But it also has caused problems for him with federal court monitors, who are not so fond of the old ways. For years they have been prodding Berrios to comply with standards from the landmark Shakman decree aimed at ending political patronage in local government.</p>\n<p>The monitors’ reports, reviewed by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica Illinois, reveal a persistent pattern in Berrios’ office of improper hiring and firing, arbitrary staffing decisions and resistance to change. The pace of reform has been slow and the assessor’s commitment often tepid, records and interviews show.</p>\n<p>Even after five years of court hearings and monitoring, the office has yet to emerge from federal oversight — and county taxpayers are paying a price. The county covers bills for both the Shakman attorneys and the court monitor, ongoing costs that now total more than $3 million, according to bills approved by a federal judge and county records.</p>\n<p>The examination of Berrios’ struggle with Shakman compliance comes as the basic competence of his assessment operation has been challenged. The investigative series “<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/\">The Tax Divide</a>,” which launched in the Tribune in June, found deep flaws in property assessments under Berrios during many of the same years the office ran afoul of the Shakman agreement.</p>\n<p>The series, based on an analysis of millions of property tax records, found that residential assessments in Cook County were inaccurate and unfair during Berrios’ tenure, punishing poorer residents and handing breaks to wealthier ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/the-tax-divide/cook-county-commercial-and-industrial-property-tax-assessments/\">A December installment</a>, co-published with ProPublica Illinois, exposed inequities and inaccuracies in Berrios’ commercial and industrial assessments during the years 2011 through 2015, with downtown skyscrapers landing massive breaks while small businesses got hit with unfair property tax bills.</p>\n<p>The person now in charge of those valuations is Berrios’ daughter Vanessa, who was promoted into the job in 2016 — a move that the federal monitor said “flagrantly violated” employment guidelines.</p>\n<p>Cynthia Canary, a good-government consultant, sees a connection between the way the assessor’s office operates under Berrios and the questions swirling around one of his most fundamental tasks: issuing accurate property assessments.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got an office that practices patronage and disregards rules, I don’t think we should be surprised that the outcomes we get, in terms of assessments, are shoddy,” said Canary, who formerly ran the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform and headed an ethics task force for Mayor Rahm Emanuel.</p>\n<p>“It’s like garbage in, garbage out.”</p>\n<p>One monitor report, filed in late 2014, found that a department in the assessor’s office that gathers data to calculate property values was “impacted by political patronage.” That report also found that some workers who handle technical reviews — a final step in assessments where information can be corrected or added — felt underused, saying they were getting cut out of decisions they had made before Berrios took office.</p>\n<p>“The staff does not feel utilized despite having the working knowledge and skills to get the job done,” the monitor wrote.</p>\n<p>Hired by Berrios to serve as his director of compliance, Deborah Ellis pushed hard for new policies at the assessor’s office. But in 2014, about 15 months into her job, Berrios fired her.</p>\n<p>“Nobody likes change,” Ellis said in a text message, in response to questions for this story. “Especially if it is perceived as a limitation of power. Or a disruption.”</p>\n<p>In an interview, Berrios declined to discuss Ellis’ dismissal and said he’s making progress in bringing his office up to speed with what Shakman and the federal court monitors demand, despite a shrinking payroll. “Believe me, I want them out of here,” he said of the monitors.</p>\n<p>Berrios also defended his practice of carrying relatives on his public payroll and the hiring of political allies from the Cook County Board of Review, where he had served as tax appeals commissioner for two decades. He said the hires — who included his son and a sister — arrived with deep and valuable experience from years of working in the property tax system.</p>\n<p>“They all work hard,” Berrios said, adding: “They will do whatever they have to do to make sure the assessments come through fair for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Berrios, who manages more than 260 employees and a $24.8 million annual budget, scoffed at suggestions that personnel moves hurt his office’s ability to determine property values. “No, that’s totally untrue,” he said. “We’re doing our job.”</p>\n<p>This year Berrios hired a former assistant state’s attorney to help meet the anti-patronage standards.</p>\n<p>Berrios also noted that he has finished assessments on time six years in a row, helping local governments save “millions and millions” on borrowing costs.</p>\n<p>Yet a Tribune-ProPublica Illinois analysis of tens of thousands of commercial and industrial parcels found numerous values that remained identical from one reassessment period to the next, three years later. Experts said that would be virtually impossible had the assessor’s office actually done the work of valuing the property.</p>\n<p>Michael Shakman, the attorney who brought the original case against local governments over unfair hiring and personnel practices, said the assessor’s office has moved too slowly and is far from reformed.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-shakman-story-michael-shakman-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-shakman-story-michael-shakman-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-shakman-story-michael-shakman-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-shakman-story-michael-shakman-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-shakman-story-michael-shakman-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Attorney Michael Shakman, whose anti-patronage efforts have led to reforms at several government departments in Chicago and Cook County. Federal court monitors have been working with the assessor's office for five years.\n<span>(Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Political favoritism and inconsistency in hiring, promotions and other employment decisions can create a “negative impact, both on the morale of the people in the office who are trying to do the work the right way and on the quality of the work that gets done,” Shakman said in an interview.</p>\n<h3>The ‘Berrios People’</h3>\n<p>Not much time ticked off the clock between Berrios taking the oath of office for his first term and the assessor’s new team calling veteran workers into private meetings to let them go.</p>\n<p>“They just had an assembly line, going in one after another,” said Robert Johnson, a longtime employee who said the group was notified within hours of Berrios taking charge on Dec. 6, 2010. “They introduced themselves, ‘Nice to meet you.’ They said they wanted to go in a different direction. They told you to turn in your keys, your IDs, all that stuff.”</p>\n<p>The sweep ultimately caused county taxpayers to pay $529,000 in compensation to 11 workers fired in acts of “unlawful political discrimination.” The federal court monitor later described the moves as evidence that the assessor wanted to “make room” for the people he wanted to hire.</p>\n<p>Johnson, who received $95,000 in compensation, said in an interview that he outlined for the monitor his three decades of work in the assessor’s office and his role managing how property parcels got shaped. Johnson also took issue with the person who would later get his job: Michael LaCalamita, whose mother, Victoria, became Berrios’ human resources chief.</p>\n<p>“They were big buddies and all this,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>The assessor acknowledges that Victoria LaCalamita is a close friend he’s known since 1980. But Berrios brushed aside Johnson’s objections, saying, “Everyone has a chance to make their own interpretation.”</p>\n<p>Both LaCalamitas came with Berrios from the Board of Review. Michael LaCalamita no longer works at the assessor’s office; his mother now holds a top financial position.</p>\n<p>The monitor’s decision to compensate the workers still irks Berrios, who says he believed he acted properly when he fired them.</p>\n<p>Patronage has been an issue in the assessor’s office for decades, and prior assessors have operated under various Shakman orders since 1972. But Berrios’ early actions as assessor prompted Shakman to push for an additional step: installing a federal monitor who would track the assessor’s progress in achieving various anti-patronage benchmarks.</p>\n<p>Federal monitors helped both Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart resolve Shakman cases. Emanuel inherited a federal monitor in the mayor’s office, and Dart embraced the idea of installing a monitor when he became sheriff.</p>\n<p>After lengthy discussions, Shakman and Berrios reached a federal court agreement in September 2012 that set a path forward. The assessor agreed to create more transparent procedures with the goal of rooting out patronage in hiring and staffing decisions as well as hiring an internal compliance director.</p>\n<p>The compliance director, an employee of the assessor’s office, was supposed to ensure that it adheres to all employment policies and procedures, including Shakman prohibitions against political hiring. Meanwhile, the federal court monitor would review the claims of workers fired unfairly, detail developments and help push for progress until the office was found to be in compliance.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long before the new monitor, retired Cook County Judge Clifford Meacham, delivered a sobering analysis. In a report filed in January 2013, Meacham said the assessor’s office had a “widespread disregard for written policies and procedures,” from skirting competitive hiring rules to skipping performance evaluations.</p>\n<p>Meacham emphasized that even smaller favors should stop. He highlighted how a special group of 19 transplants from the review board known in the assessor’s office as the “Berrios people” got to come and go at work without having to swipe their office cards and didn’t have to give advance notice for vacations.</p>\n<p>Giving breaks to one “politically connected” group over others frustrates the purpose of the Shakman agreement, Meacham wrote.</p>\n<p>That agreement does not directly address nepotism, but Berrios’ decision to put his sister, Carmen, and his son, Joseph, on the payroll drew the attention of the County Board of Ethics, which sought to fine Berrios $10,000 in 2012.</p>\n<p>A judge ruled in 2015 that the assessor had to comply with the county’s ethics ordinance and the ethics board had the authority to investigate the assessor. But the ruling also said the ordinance did not authorize the board to impose fines. County taxpayers wound up paying a total of about $300,000 to cover both sides of the legal battle, records show, and county commissioners passed a new ordinance giving the board the power to levy fines in the future.</p>\n<p>Berrios’ son no longer works at the assessor’s office. His sister now is deputy assessor over taxpayer services and public outreach.</p>\n<p>As Berrios headed into his second term in late 2014 — after running unopposed in the primary and general elections — Meacham issued a report that made it clear the assessor still had many issues to overcome.</p>\n<p>High-level aides in the assessor’s office, Meacham wrote, had characterized Shakman standards as “not a priority” and “being without value.” Overall, he wrote, “The general impression of the employees in the office was that employment actions were based on nepotism, favoritism, or politics.”</p>\n<h3>‘Not a Priority’</h3>\n<p>Deborah Ellis, chosen from 53 applicants to serve as compliance director in Berrios’ office, started her job in the summer of 2013. Meacham praised her as a “well-qualified individual with strong investigative skills, law enforcement experience, experience in government, and a firm commitment to service.”</p>\n<p>But Meacham also described Ellis as “frustrated” with arbitrary personnel actions and “hampered” by the assessor’s office in trying to investigate potential irregularities in hiring, promotions and discipline.</p>\n<p>“She advocated for written policies and procedures and a transparent and fair process for all employees, to no avail,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>In a report to Meacham and Berrios, two months before his re-election, Ellis complained of a lack of communication with Berrios and his top staff, calling the matter a “critical area which needs vast improvement.”</p>\n<p>The assessor had not “involved himself in any conversation regarding compliance efforts” with her, Ellis wrote in the September 2014 report, and his chief of staff is “very rarely involved.”</p>\n<p>The next month, in October, Berrios fired Ellis. A new internal compliance director did not come aboard until February 2016 — more than a year later.</p>\n<p>The assessor’s office blames that delay on the monitor. In a December 2014 report, Meacham had recommended that Ellis’ position remain vacant until “such time as the assessor’s office demonstrates a willingness to effect actual and meaningful reforms.”</p>\n<p>In the same report, Meacham demanded that the assessor’s office hire “a professional” as head of human resources. Establishing professional human resources departments had been a “key driver” for Emanuel and Dart in meeting Shakman standards, Meacham noted.</p>\n<p>But under Berrios, Meacham wrote: “There were no written policies and procedures for the employees to reference or for the office to follow. The contents of the personnel files were not standardized. There was no discernible disciplinary policy, overtime policy, promotion policy or hiring protocol that had been consistently utilized.</p>\n<p>“There were no performance evaluations,” he added. “Position descriptions and organization charts were incomplete and inaccurate.”</p>\n<p>Meacham also criticized an “opaque process” in employment decisions that appeared to include only Victoria LaCalamita and the assessor.</p>\n<p>Berrios disputed that point in an interview. “That’s not the case,” he said. “Not at all.”</p>\n<p>Records show Meacham viewed it as “impossible” for the assessor’s office to comply with Shakman standards as long as LaCalamita ran the human resources operation.</p>\n<p>Ellis raised similar issues as Berrios’ director of compliance. In a September 2014 review of the assessor’s office, she wrote that LaCalamita was “inconsistent and unpredictable” in responding to inquiries and often challenged Ellis’ authority.</p>\n<p>Berrios moved LaCalamita from human resources the following month — around the same time he fired Ellis.</p>\n<p>By May 2015 — six months into Berrios’ second term and well into his third year under a federal monitor — Meacham reported that numerous ongoing delays, a lack of written policies and resistance to issues the monitor raised “all suggest that Shakman is not a priority in the assessor’s office.”</p>\n<p>“As always, actions are telling,” Meacham wrote.</p>\n<p>In a coda to that May report, he said the “lack of meaningful progress that has characterized this endeavor will continue to the detriment of those employed by the assessor, those who seek to be employed by the assessor and, most significantly, the taxpayers of Cook County.”</p>\n<p>In his last report, filed in August 2015, Meacham described the assessor’s progress toward compliance as slow but steady. “Much remains to be done,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Attorney Susan Feibus took over monitoring duties in February 2016 after Meacham voluntarily resigned.</p>\n<p>Later that year, in her first report, Feibus determined Berrios had “paid lip service” to achieving Shakman standards and his “conduct has belied a genuine commitment to the process.”</p>\n<p>She also trained her attention on Berrios’ promotion of his daughter Vanessa to the high-level job of director of industrial and commercial valuations in April 2016 — a move that came with a significant boost in salary.</p>\n<p>Vanessa Berrios’ annual pay was $80,373 in 2015 while she worked as a manager of industrial and commercial valuations, but her salary in 2016 as director was $107,099, the monitor wrote.</p>\n<p>The promotion “flagrantly violated” employment guidelines the assessor should have followed even though it was a management post with leeway in hiring, Feibus wrote in August 2016. For one thing, she noted, the younger Berrios didn’t have the minimum five years of management experience outlined in a job description updated only months earlier.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Ignoring the updated job description, the assessor’s office deemed Berrios’ daughter to be eligible under an older job description that, Feibus said, officials “erroneously” interpreted as requiring no managerial experience. Feibus said requiring no managerial experience for such a high-ranking job was “ludicrous,” but her objections “went unheeded.”</p>\n<p>Berrios said in an interview that Vanessa Berrios was just short of five years as a manager at the time of her promotion and that she built up that experience in the same department where she was promoted.</p>\n<p>“She’s doing a fabulous job for us,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Progress Report</h3>\n<p>Overall movement in the assessor’s case is tracked every couple of months in Judge Sidney Schenkier’s federal courtroom, where the sounds of street traffic and sirens filter up from 18 floors below.</p>\n<p>In a post-Thanksgiving status hearing last month, Berrios and his team, Feibus and an aide, and Shakman attorney Brian Hays marked a minor milestone when the assessor’s office confirmed that job applications had gone online earlier in November. A monitor report from August 2015 had said that the office’s paper application process “encourages confusion and distrust” in hiring.</p>\n<p>For a time, Berrios attempted to set up his own electronic application process, but amid mounting pressure from Schenkier, Feibus and Hays, he worked out a way to join the online system used by other county offices.</p>\n<p>As it happens, however, Berrios is starting to use the online system just as countywide budget cuts are forcing him to lay off workers, diminishing the immediate need for electronic applications.</p>\n<p>“The Catch-22 we’re in is, we’re not going to be using it anytime soon because we’re not going to be hiring,” said Tom Nowinski, a former assistant state’s attorney with Shakman experience whom Berrios hired this year to work solely on helping to bring the assessor’s office into compliance.</p>\n<p>The parties also are moving forward on employee evaluations, updated job descriptions and other policies and procedures, records show. Berrios has increased the number of people in human resources, although he’s still under pressure to improve the department, and he’s put in place an employment plan that gives a better road map for the office.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made significant progress,” Berrios said.</p>\n<p>Berrios spokesman Tom Shaer said “there is no material non-compliance” in the assessor’s office. But Feibus, who wrote in September of the office’s “excellent progress” in writing policies, pointedly noted that “drafting policies is only the first step. Implementation is equally, if not more, important.”</p>\n<p>Hays added that only in the last six months did the assessor’s office “finally begin drafting policies and procedures required under the September 2012 agreed order. The assessor’s office has also begun updating job descriptions that had not been updated since 2006 or earlier.”</p>\n<p>Berrios said the delay in bringing his office into compliance can be blamed on the changeover in monitors — as well as their use of five different assistants along the way. The turnover, he said, slowed progress and drove up costs in ways he can’t control.</p>\n<p>“I can only move as fast as they allow me to move,” Berrios said.</p>\n<p>Shakman disagreed: “They’re trying to blame somebody else for their delay.”</p>\n<p>Ellis, who now works as an attorney for the federal government, said recent reports from the court monitor describe the same lack of commitment she saw in the assessor and his team during her time as director of compliance.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t look like that has changed,” she said.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7798537.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/marshall-allen\">Marshall Allen</a> </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Gallup organization set out to identify the top concerns everyday Americans have about money. Researchers asked more than a thousand people across the country, “What is the most important financial problem facing your family today?” Their top answer: the cost of health care.</p>\n<p>Increases in medical costs have substantially outpaced economic growth for decades. In recent months, ProPublica has shown that it doesn’t have to be this way. It’s been estimated that the U.S. health care system wastes about $765 billion a year — about a quarter of what’s spent. We’ve identified ways that tens of billions of dollars are being wasted, some of them overlooked even by many experts and academics studying this problem.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to reduce or eliminate some of the waste, but there are also formidable forces that benefit from it. Excess spending generates revenue and profit for what some have called the “medical industrial complex,” said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice. “There are a number of people who can imagine ways to solve things,” Welch said of the wasted spending. “But the political will and the forces at work can stop them pretty easily.”</p>\n<p>Still, wasting fewer health care dollars could drive down insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs and maybe even free up resources for education, retirement and wage increases, among other things.</p>\n<p>Here are the ways ProPublica found the medical industry is needlessly gobbling up money, along with steps health care leaders or policymakers say we could take right now to reduce the waste.  </p>\n<h3>What Hospitals Waste</h3>\n<p>The nation’s health care tab is sky-high. We’re tracking down the reasons. First stop: a look at all the perfectly good stuff hospitals throw away. </p>\n<p><strong>What ProPublica found:</strong> Hospitals routinely toss out brand-new supplies and gently used equipment. Most of it goes to the dump, but some gets picked up by nonprofit organizations that ship the goods to the developing world. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-spinski-grid-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-spinski-grid-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-spinski-grid-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-spinski-grid-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Partners for World Health ships America’s unwanted medical supplies from their warehouse to countries with under-developed health care systems like Greece, Syria and Uganda.\n<span>(Tristan Spinski, special to ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>How much money is wasted:</strong> No one tracks the total, but one charity in Maine had about $20 million worth of discarded goods filling its warehouses. Similar nonprofits operate around the country. The University of California, San Francisco Medical Center studied how much it wasted during neurosurgery operations in one year. The discarded supplies were worth $2.9 million. </p>\n<p><strong>How to stop the squandering:</strong> UCSF reduced waste by reviewing the lists of supplies each surgeon wanted prepped for an operation. Many items could be taken off the lists. That reduced the number of supplies opened to set up each procedure, said Dr. R. Adams Dudley, director of the UCSF Center for Healthcare Value.</p>\n<p>Hospitals could reduce wasted supplies by tracking everything thrown away, said Dr. Robert Pearl, former CEO of The Permanente Medical Group, the country’s largest medical group and author of the book “Mistreated.” The amount of waste could be reported when each patient is discharged, he said. Seeing the waste quantified would motivate people to prevent it, he said.</p>\n<p>Several experts said paying hospitals a lump sum for everything involved in a particular procedure, instead of a la carte for each item, would mean they make more profit by cutting the amount of wasted supplies and equipment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/what-hospitals-waste\">Read the story.</a></p>\n<h3>America’s Other Drug Problem</h3>\n<p>Every year nursing homes nationwide flush, burn or throw out tons of valuable prescription drugs. Iowa collects them and gives them to needy patients for free. Most other states don’t. </p>\n<p><strong>What ProPublica found:</strong> Nursing home patients typically have their drugs dispensed a month at a time. So whenever a drug gets discontinued— if a patient dies, or moves out, or has a reaction — there’s excess. Most nursing homes throw away the leftover drugs. They flush them down the toilet, put them in the trash or pay to have them incinerated. Iowa started a nonprofit organization to recover the excess drugs, inspect them and dispense them for free to patients.</p>\n<p><strong>How much money is wasted:</strong> It’s estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars a year are wasted by throwing out nursing home medications. The CEO of a long-term care pharmacy in Florida said his company incinerates about $2.5 million in valuable medication every year. He estimated the total is $50 million statewide. Colorado officials said the state’s long-term care facilities toss out 17.5 tons of potentially reusable drugs each year, worth about $10 million. Iowa is on pace to recover $6 million in drugs from nursing homes this year.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-roth-incinerator-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-roth-incinerator-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171220-roth-incinerator-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171220-roth-incinerator-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-roth-incinerator-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Boxes of unused drugs burn in the opening of an incinerator at Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services in Baltimore, Maryland.\n<span>(Matt Roth for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Other harm to the public:</strong> Flushing drugs down the toilet contaminates the water supply. Trace levels of pharmaceuticals have been detected in water throughout the country.</p>\n<p><strong>How to stop the squandering:</strong> Many states have laws that allow drug donation, but they have not invested in a program to help the process. ProPublica’s story <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/more-states-hatch-plans-to-recycle-drugs-being-wasted-in-nursing-homes\">prompted lawmakers</a> in Florida and New Hampshire to introduce legislation to create a program like Iowa’s. Leaders in the Vermont medical community have also shown interest in starting a drug donation program.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/americas-other-drug-problem\">Read the story.</a></p>\n<h3>How Two Common Medications Became One $455 Million Specialty Pill</h3>\n<p>After I was prescribed a brand-name drug I didn’t need and given a coupon to cover the out-of-pocket costs, I discovered another reason Americans pay too much for health care. </p>\n<p><strong>What ProPublica found:</strong> A drug company combined two over-the-counter drugs, naproxen, which goes by the brand name Aleve, and esomeprazole magnesium, also known as Nexium, to create a new pill called Vimovo. My doctor prescribed it to me. The company that makes it, Horizon Pharma, marketed the single pill as an innovation because it was easier to take one pill than two. A month’s supply of the two inexpensive drugs costs about $40. The company billed insurance $3,252 for the Vimovo.</p>\n<p><strong>How much money is wasted:</strong> My insurance company rejected the bill, but Vimovo has net sales of more than $455 million since 2014. Horizon brought in $465 million more in net sales from a similar drug, Duexis, which combines ibuprofen and famotidine, aka Advil and Pepcid.</p>\n<p><strong>How to stop the squandering</strong>: Spurred by ProPublica’s story, Connecticut now requires doctors to get prior authorization to prescribe Horizon’s drugs to the 200,000 public employees, retirees and their dependents covered by a state insurance plan. The Connecticut comptroller also urged the attorney general’s office to investigate Horizon’s relationship with pharmacies and physicians. Other insurers have removed the drugs from their formularies. </p>\n<p>Welch, the Dartmouth doctor, suggested tongue-in-cheek “warning labels” on drugs that aren’t actually big innovations. In the case of Vimovo, the warning could say that the “specialty” pill is actually just a combination of two cheaper ingredients. “There may need to be public service advertisements that counter the advertising that says everything is the best thing since sliced bread,” he said.</p>\n<p>In cases where there are dramatic price increases, state lawmakers could require pharmaceutical companies to justify the higher costs, said Dr. Steven Pearson, president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. </p>\n<p>Secret deals and rebates currently cloak the actual price of drugs. Drug companies should have to publish the real prices of their products, said Linda Cahn, an attorney who advises corporations, unions and other payers on how to reduce their costs. Cahn recently proposed in an op-ed in The Hill what she calls a “bid day,” where any drug company that wants to sell its products to Medicare beneficiaries would be required to submit the net cost of each medication.  All the companies would be required to submit their price at the same time, say twice a year, and then stick with the price, which Medicare would make public for all to see. The bidding would inform consumers and force competition, she said. The same process could be used for all insurance plans, she said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/horizon-pharma-vimovo-common-medication-455-million-specialty-pill\">Read the story.</a></p>\n<h3>The Myth of Drug Expiration Dates</h3>\n<p>Hospitals and pharmacies are required to toss expired drugs, no matter how expensive or vital. Meanwhile the FDA has long known that many remain safe and potent for years longer. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-huffaker-expiration-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-huffaker-expiration-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-huffaker-expiration-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-huffaker-expiration-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-huffaker-expiration-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Pharmacist and toxicologist Lee Cantrell tested drugs that had been expired for decades. Most of them were still potent enough to be on the shelves today.\n<span>(Sandy Huffaker for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>What ProPublica found:</strong> The term “expiration date” is a misnomer. The dates on drug labels are the point up to which pharmaceutical companies guarantee their effectiveness. But that does not mean the drugs are ineffective or dangerous the moment after they “expire.” The Food and Drug Administration and Defense Department created the Shelf Life Extension Program to test the stability of drugs in the federal government’s stockpiles and then extend their expiration dates, when possible. A 2006 study of 122 drugs tested by the program showed that two-thirds of them were stable every time a lot was tested. Each of them had their expiration dates extended, on average, by more than four years. But the same type of drugs in hospitals or pharmacies get thrown away when they “expire.”</p>\n<p><strong>How much money is wasted:</strong> The total is unknown, but one mid-size hospital in Boston had to destroy about $200,000 in expired drugs in 2016. If hospitals nationwide throw out similar amounts of drugs annually, the total would be about $800 million trashed each year by hospital pharmacies alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Other harm to the public:</strong> Some expired drugs are in short supply and difficult to replace. On occasion, a pharmaceutical company will extend the expiration date of drugs for which there are shortages, but they are not required to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>How to stop the squandering:</strong> Drug companies could be required to do studies to determine how long their products actually last, and report the information, said Lee Cantrell, a pharmacist who helps run the California Poison Control System. Also, the government could publish data from the Shelf Life Extension Program, which is funded by taxpayers. The information would help people see “many types of medications are safe and effective much longer than their original expiration dates,” Cantrell said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myth-of-drug-expiration-dates\">Read the story.</a></p>\n<h3>Drug Companies Make Eyedrops Too Big — And You Pay for the Waste</h3>\n<p>The makers of cancer drugs also make vials with too much medication for many patients. The excess drugs are tossed in the trash — another reason health care costs are so high.</p>\n<p><strong>What ProPublica found:</strong> Drug companies make eyedrops much larger than what the eye can hold. That means patients pay for the excess from each drop, which runs down their cheeks. Vials of cancer drugs are also larger than necessary. The leftover cancer medication is billed to the patient — and thrown in the trash can. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-eye-drops-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-eye-drops-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-eye-drops-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-eye-drops-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Gregory Matthews, who is partially blind because of glaucoma, uses eyedrops every day to preserve his remaining sight.\n<span>(Matt Roth for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>How much money is wasted:</strong> It’s unknown how much it costs to waste a portion of each eyedrop, but the industry is huge. Last year, drug companies brought in about $3.4 billion in the U.S. alone for dry eyes and glaucoma drops, according to the research firm Market Scope. A 2016 study estimated that, of the top 20 cancer drugs packaged in single-use vials, 10 percent of the medication is wasted, at a cost of $1.8 billion a year. </p>\n<p><strong>How to stop the squandering:</strong> Citing ProPublica’s story, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/senators-introduce-bill-to-reduce-colossal-and-completely-preventable-waste\">two U.S. senators introduced legislation</a> that would require federal agencies to stop the waste associated with eyedrops and single-use cancer drug vials. Drugmakers could reduce the waste of cancer medication by making vials in varying sizes, so that less would be left over from each patient, said Dr. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Bach led a team that estimated the waste associated with vials of cancer drugs. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/drug-companies-make-eyedrops-too-big-and-you-pay-for-the-waste\">Read the story.</a></p>\n<h3>A Hospital Charged $1,877 to Pierce a 5-Year-Old’s Ears. This Is Why Health Care Costs So Much.</h3>\n<p>An epidemic of unnecessary treatment is wasting billions of health care dollars a year. Patients and taxpayers are paying for it.</p>\n<p><strong>What ProPublica found:</strong> It’s common for medical providers to deliver care that’s not needed, or that costs more than necessary, and patients get stuck with the bills. In one case, a Colorado mom said her surgeon offered to pierce her daughter’s ears as an add-on to a different operation. The mom agreed, assuming it would be free. But the hospital stuck her with a bill for $1,877 for “operating room services.” ProPublica also highlighted unnecessary imaging tests, like extra mammograms and ultrasounds, and found it’s common for hospital intensive care to be delivered to patients who are too sick or too healthy to benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>How much money is wasted:</strong> Unnecessary or needlessly expensive care wastes about $210 billion a year, according to the National Academy of Medicine. The cost of false-positive tests and overdiagnosed breast cancer is $4 billion a year, according to a 2015 Health Affairs study. Unnecessary intensive care costs about $137 million a year for about 100 hospitals in two states, one study estimated. That would put the tab of non-beneficial intensive care in the billions nationwide.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-jenna-dong-chang-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171221-jenna-dong-chang-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171221-jenna-dong-chang-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171221-jenna-dong-chang-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171221-jenna-dong-chang-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Dr. Dong Chang, director of the medical intensive care unit at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, has found that many patients are too sick or too healthy to benefit from intensive care.\n<span>(Jenna Schoenefeld for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>How to stop the squandering:</strong> Medicare has a fee schedule that sets prices and makes them public, said Welch, the Dartmouth physician who advocates against overtreatment. States could pass laws that establish similar fee schedules, he said, or insurance companies could implement them. Establishing set prices would reduce administrative overhead, he said, and allow patients to shop for the best deals.</p>\n<p>Several experts said policymakers need to move medical providers from payment based on volume of services to payment based on value. Right now “fee for service” payment is common, so providers get a fee for everything they do. This gives them the incentive to do more, sometimes more than is necessary, or to provide care that’s more expensive than it has to be. If providers were paid a lump sum to care for individuals or a group of patients, and the outcomes of their performance were measured to ensure quality didn’t suffer, they would cut the waste. “You want to empower organizations to be responsible for improving patient health and reducing costs,” said Dr. Elliott Fisher, director of The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-hospital-charged-to-pierce-ears-why-health-care-costs-so-much\">Read the story.</a></p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7798068.gif\" height=\"1\">",

The ad showed a smiling, millennial-aged woman seated at a computer and promised that new hires could look forward to a rewarding career in which they would be “more than just a number.”</p>\n<p>Some relevant numbers were not immediately evident. The promotion was set to run on the Facebook feeds of users 25 to 36 years old who lived in the nation’s capital, or had recently visited there, and had demonstrated an interest in finance. For a vast majority of the hundreds of millions of people who check Facebook every day, the ad did not exist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Verizon\">Verizon</a> is among dozens of the nation's leading employers — including <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Amazon\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#GoldmanSachs\">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Target\">Target</a> and <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Facebook\">Facebook</a> itself — that placed recruitment ads limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times has found.</p>\n<p>The ability of advertisers to deliver their message to the precise audience most likely to respond is the cornerstone of Facebook’s business model. But using the system to expose job opportunities only to certain age groups has raised concerns about fairness to older workers.</p>\n<p>Several experts questioned whether the practice is in keeping with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment. Many jurisdictions make it a crime to “aid” or “abet” age discrimination, a provision that could apply to companies like Facebook that distribute job ads.</p>\n<p>“It’s blatantly unlawful,” said Debra Katz, a Washington employment lawyer who represents victims of discrimination.</p>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/addressing-targeting-in-recruitment-ads/\">defended the practice</a>. “Used responsibly, age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted industry practice and for good reason: it helps employers recruit and people of all ages find work,” said Rob Goldman, a Facebook vice president.</p>\n<p>The revelations come at a time when the unregulated power of the tech companies is under increased scrutiny, and Congress is weighing whether to limit the immunity that it granted to tech companies in 1996 for third-party content on their platforms.</p>\n<p>Facebook has argued in court filings that the law, the Communications Decency Act, makes it immune from liability for discriminatory ads.</p>\n<p>Although Facebook is a relatively new entrant into the recruiting arena, it is rapidly gaining popularity with employers. Earlier this year, the social network launched a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/take-the-work-out-of-hiring\">section of its site devoted to job ads</a>. Facebook allows advertisers to select their audience, and then Facebook finds the chosen users with the extensive data it collects about its members.</p>\n<p>The use of age targets emerged in a review of data originally compiled by ProPublica readers for a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online\">project about political ad placement</a> on Facebook. Many of the ads include a disclosure by Facebook about why the user is seeing the ad, which can be anything from their age to their affinity for folk music.</p>\n<p>The precision of Facebook’s ad delivery has helped it dominate an industry once in the hands of print and broadcast outlets. The system, called microtargeting, allows advertisers to reach essentially whomever they prefer, including the people their analysis suggests are the most plausible hires or consumers, lowering the costs and vastly increasing efficiency.</p>\n<p>Targeted Facebook ads were an important tool in Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election. The social media giant has acknowledged that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html\">126 million people</a> saw Russia-linked content, some of which was aimed at particular demographic groups and regions. Facebook has also come under criticism for the disclosure that it accepted ads aimed at “<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\">Jew-haters</a>” as well as <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race\">housing ads</a> that discriminated by race, gender, disability and other factors.</p>\n<p>Other tech companies also offer employers opportunities to discriminate by age. ProPublica bought job ads on Google and LinkedIn that excluded audiences older than 40 — and the ads were instantly approved. Google said it does not prevent advertisers from displaying ads based on the user’s age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its system to prevent such targeting in employment ads.</p>\n<p>The practice has begun to attract legal challenges. On Wednesday, a class-action complaint alleging age discrimination was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334241-Outten-Golden-Complaint-FILED.html\">filed in federal court</a> in San Francisco on behalf of the Communications Workers of America and its members — as well as all Facebook users 40 or older who may have been denied the chance to learn about job openings. The plaintiffs’ lawyers said the complaint was based on ads for dozens of companies that they had discovered on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The database of Facebook ads collected by ProPublica shows how often and precisely employers recruit by age. In a search for “part-time package handlers,” United Parcel Service ran an ad aimed at people 18 to 24. <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#StateFarm\">State Farm</a> pitched its hiring promotion to those 19 to 35.</p>\n<p>Some companies, including Target, State Farm and UPS, defended their targeting as a part of a broader recruitment strategy that reached candidates of all ages. The group of companies making this case included Facebook itself, which ran career ads on its own platform, many aimed at people 25 to 60. “We completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,” said Goldman of Facebook.</p>\n<p>After being contacted by ProPublica and the Times, other employers, including Amazon, <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#NorthwesternMutual\">Northwestern Mutual</a> and the <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#NYCTeachingFellows\">New York City Department of Education</a>, said they had changed or were changing their recruiting strategies.</p>\n<p>“We recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,” said Nina Lindsey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, which targeted some ads for workers at its distribution centers between the ages of 18 and 50. “We have corrected those ads.”</p>\n<p>Verizon did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Several companies argued that targeted recruiting on Facebook was comparable to advertising opportunities in publications like the AARP magazine or Teen Vogue, which are aimed at particular age groups. But this obscures an important distinction. Anyone can buy Teen Vogue and see an ad. Online, however, people outside the targeted age groups can be excluded in ways they will never learn about.</p>\n<p>“What happens with Facebook is you don’t know what you don’t know,” said David Lopez, a former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is one of the lawyers at the firm Outten &amp; Golden bringing the age-discrimination case on behalf of the communication workers union.</p>\n<h3>‘They Know I’m Dead’</h3>\n<p>Age discrimination on digital platforms is something that many workers suspect is happening to them, but that is often difficult to prove.</p>\n<p>Mark Edelstein, a fitfully employed social-media marketing strategist who is 58 and legally blind, doesn’t pretend to know what he doesn’t know, but he has his suspicions.</p>\n<p>Edelstein, who lives in St. Louis, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. “Once you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,” he said. “I’ve gone into interviews, with my head of gray hair and my receding hairline, and they know I’m dead.”</p>\n<p>Edelstein spends most of his days scouring sites like LinkedIn and Indeed and pitching hiring managers with personalized appeals. When he scrolled through his Facebook ads on a Wednesday in December, he saw a variety of ads reflecting his interest in social media marketing: ads for the marketing software <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot</a> (“15 free infographic templates!”) and TripIt, which he used to book a trip to visit his mother in Florida.</p>\n<p>What he didn’t see was a single ad for a job in his profession, including one identified by ProPublica that was being shown to younger users: a posting for a <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20171220-facebook-ads-HubSpot.png\">social media director job at HubSpot</a>. The company asked that the ad be shown to people aged 27 to 40 who live or were recently living in the United States.</p>\n<p>“Hypothetically, had I seen a job for a social media director at HubSpot, even if it involved relocation, I ABSOLUTELY would have applied for it,” Edelstein said by email when told about the ad.</p>\n<p>A HubSpot spokeswoman, Ellie Botelho, said that the job was posted on many sites, including LinkedIn, The Ladders and Built in Boston, and was open to anyone meeting the qualifications regardless of age or any other demographic characteristic.</p>\n<p>She added that “the use of the targeted age-range selection on the Facebook ad was frankly a mistake on our part given our lack of experience using that platform for job postings and not a feature we will use again.”</p>\n<p>For his part, Edelstein says he understands why marketers wouldn’t want to target ads at him: “It doesn’t surprise me a bit. Why would they want a 58-year-old white guy who’s disabled?”</p>\n<h3>Looking for ’Younger Blood’</h3>\n<p>Although LinkedIn is the leading online recruitment platform, according to <a href=\"https://www.sourcecon.com/the-2017-state-of-sourcing-survey-the-technology/\">an annual</a> survey by SourceCon, an industry website. Facebook is rapidly increasing in popularity for employers.</p>\n<p>One reason is that Facebook’s sheer size — two billion monthly active users, versus LinkedIn’s 530 million total members — gives recruiters access to types of workers they can’t find elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Consider nurses, whom hospitals are desperate to hire. “They’re less likely to use LinkedIn,” said Josh Rock, a recruiter at a large hospital system in Minnesota who has expertise in digital media. “Nurses are predominantly female, there’s a larger volume of Facebook users. That’s what they use.”</p>\n<p>There are also millions of hourly workers who have never visited LinkedIn, and may not even have a résumé, but who check Facebook obsessively.</p>\n<p>Deb Andrychuk, chief executive of the Arland Group, which helps employers place recruitment ads, said clients sometimes asked her firm to target ads by age, saying they needed “to start bringing younger blood” into their organizations. “It’s not necessarily that we wouldn’t take someone older,” these clients say, according to Andrychuk, “but if you could bring in a younger set of applicants, it would definitely work out better.”</p>\n<p>Andrychuk said that “we coach clients to be open and not discriminate” and that after being contacted by The Times, her team updated all their ads to ensure they didn’t exclude any age groups.</p>\n<p>But some companies contend that there are permissible reasons to filter audiences by age, as with an ad for entry-level analyst positions at Goldman Sachs that was distributed to people 18 to 64. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, said showing it to people above that age range would have wasted money: roughly 25 percent of those who typically click on the firm’s untargeted ads are 65 or older, but people that age almost never apply for the analyst job.</p>\n<p>“We welcome and actively recruit applicants of all ages,” Williams said. “For some of our social-media ads, we look to get the content to the people most likely to be interested, but do not exclude anyone from our recruiting activity.”</p>\n<p>Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, unlike the federal anti-discrimination statute that covers race and gender, allows an employer to take into account “reasonable factors” that may be highly correlated with the protected characteristic, such as cost, as long as they don’t rely on the characteristic explicitly.</p>\n<h3>The Question of Liability</h3>\n<p>In various ways, Facebook and LinkedIn have acknowledged at least a modest obligation to police their ad platforms against abuse.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Facebook said it would require advertisers to “self-certify” that their housing, employment and credit ads were compliant with anti-discrimination laws, but that it would not block marketers from purchasing age-restricted ads.</p>\n<p>Still, Facebook didn’t promise to monitor those certifications for accuracy. And Facebook said the self-certification system, announced in February, was still being rolled out to all advertisers.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn, in response to inquiries by ProPublica, added a self-certification step that prevents employers from using age ranges when placing an employment ad, unless they affirm the ad is not discriminatory.</p>\n<p>With these efforts evolving, legal experts say it is unclear how much liability the tech platforms could have. Some civil rights laws, like the Fair Housing Act, explicitly require publishers to assume liability for discriminatory ads.</p>\n<p>But the Age Discrimination in Employment Act assigns liability only to employers or employment agencies, like recruiters and advertising firms.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit filed against Facebook on behalf of the communications workers argues that the company essentially plays the role of an employment agency — collecting and providing data that helps employers locate candidates, effectively coordinating with the employer to develop the advertising strategies, informing employers about the performance of the ads, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether courts accept that argument, the tech companies could also face liability under certain state or local anti-discrimination statutes. For example, California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to “aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing” of discriminatory acts proscribed by the statute.</p>\n<p>“They may have an obligation there not to aid and abet an ad that enables discrimination,” said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer based in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The question may hinge on Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.</p>\n<p>Tech companies have successfully invoked this law to avoid liability for offensive or criminal content — including <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1728752.html\">sex trafficking</a>, <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2017cv00932/468549/21/\">revenge porn</a> and <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1669834.html\">calls for violence against Jews</a>. Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.pacerpro.com/cases/3286861\">currently arguing</a> in federal court that Section 230 immunizes it against liability for ad placement that blocks members of certain racial and ethnic groups from seeing the ads.</p>\n<p>“Advertisers, not Facebook, are responsible for both the content of their ads and what targeting criteria to use, if any,” Facebook argued in its <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333515-Outten-FB-FB-Motion-to-Dismiss-4-3-17.html\">motion to dismiss</a> allegations that its ads violated a host of civil rights laws. The case does not allege age discrimination.</p>\n<p>Eric Goldman, professor and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, who has written extensively about Section 230, says it is hard to predict how courts would treat Facebook’s age-targeting of employment ads.</p>\n<p>Goldman said the law covered the content of ads, and that courts have made clear that Facebook would not be liable for an advertisement in which an employer wrote, say, “no one over 55 need apply.” But it is not clear how the courts would treat Facebook’s offering of age-targeted customization.</p>\n<p>According to a federal appellate court decision in a <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1493375.html\">fair-housing case</a>, a platform can be considered to have helped “develop unlawful content” that users play a role in generating, which would negate the immunity.</p>\n<p>“Depending on how the targeting is happening, you can make potentially different sorts of arguments about whether or not Google or Facebook or LinkedIn is contributing to the development” of the ad, said Deirdre K. Mulligan, a faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7792902.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/topher-sanders\">Topher Sanders</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Benjamin Conarck</span>, Florida Times-Union </p>\n<p>On its face, Florida’s pedestrian statute 316.130(11) seems straightforward enough: fail to cross a street in a crosswalk where required, and you are liable for a ticket ranging from $51 to $77. The authorities across the state issue hundreds of the tickets every year with the public claim that they were trying to cut down Florida’s outsize number of pedestrian deaths.</p>\n<p>But a Times-Union/ProPublica examination of statute 316.130(11) tickets given in four large counties from 2012 to 2017 found them rife with mistakes — errors that can cost people not only money, but also put them at risk of losing their driver’s licenses or having their credit ratings damaged.</p>\n<p>In Broward County, for instance, around 70 percent of the more than 3,300 crosswalk tickets issued in those years were given in error, according to the Times-Union/ProPublica examination. In Hillsborough County, where more than 500 crosswalk tickets were given, the percentage of bad tickets was around 80 percent; in Orange County, around 56 percent of the almost 650 tickets were given erroneously.</p>\n<p>The errors could be the result of an ignorance or misapplication of the statute’s terms. Here is the language of the statute: “Between adjacent intersections at which traffic control signals are in operation, pedestrians shall not cross at any place except in a marked crosswalk.”</p>\n<p>But the examination shows that officers routinely write tickets for people crossing the street in places that are not in between intersections with traffic lights. In short, people are being punished for failing to avail themselves of safety features that aren’t readily accessible.</p>\n<p>Melba Pearson, deputy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said the Times-Union/ProPublica findings angered her.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an absolute travesty that we have law enforcement that are giving out erroneous tickets, and don’t have a firm grasp of the law,” Pearson said. “You should have at least have an understanding of the statute that you’re using to create consequences in people’s lives.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/walking-while-black/jacksonville-pedestrian-violations-racial-profiling/\">The Times-Union and ProPublica last month examined pedestrian ticket enforcement in Duval County</a> and found that there were hundreds of erroneous statute 316.130(11) tickets given in recent years. Scores of those bad tickets led to the suspension of driver’s licenses. After Sheriff Mike Williams was told by a local City Council member that the Times-Union and ProPublica were asking questions about the statute, he asked the state attorney’s office for guidance on how the interpret and enforce the law. </p>\n<p>The examination of ticket data in Duval County showed that blacks were over-represented in all categories of pedestrian tickets — from jay walking to walking on the wrong side of the road. The analysis of the crosswalk statute data shows that blacks were similarly over-represented in all four counties examined.</p>\n<p>In Hillsborough, blacks make up 18 percent of the population, but received 43 percent of the bad tickets, according to our data analysis. In Orange County, where 23 percent of the population is black, blacks were issued 40 percent of the bad tickets. In Miami-Dade, black residents are 16 percent of the population, but received 29 percent of the flawed tickets. And in Broward, 61 percent of the bad tickets went to blacks, who make up just 30 percent of population.</p>\n<p>Florida has for years struggled to improve its record on pedestrian deaths. Metropolitan areas in Florida made up seven of the top 10 most dangerous places for people on foot in the 2016 rankings by Smart Growth America, a nonprofit research group.</p>\n<p>Ticketing pedestrians has been one of the tools the authorities have used, even while experts on the subject have concluded such measures are not likely to improve safety. Nearly 80 law enforcement agencies across the state in recent years have received Florida Department of Transportation funds to address pedestrian and bicycle safety, and many of those agencies have used the money to finance education and ticketing writing efforts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the state is still catching up in implementing measures experts agree could most improve safety for Florida’s pedestrians — upgrading the state’s transportation infrastructure by adding lighting, building safer roads and more after years of neglect. Florida today has numerous four-lane and six-lane highways with lots of local foot traffic and few marked crosswalks or intersections with traffic lights.</p>\n<p>Kate Kraft, executive director of America Walks, the only national nonprofit dedicated to pedestrian issues, said the policy of writing pedestrian tickets to try and combat fatal accidents amounted to criminalizing an infrastructure issue.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just atrocious,” Kraft said, “that something like that can cause people to dig in and have to interact with the justice system when really if they had had a safe environment to walk in to begin with, it wouldn’t have happened.”</p>\n<p>There have also been several reports in recent years suggesting Florida police have unfairly targeted blacks in various kinds of enforcement efforts. Both the Broward New Times and the Tampa Bay Times have chronicled the disproportionate numbers of tickets given to black bicyclists. Indeed, a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/how-riding-your-bike-can-land-you-in-trouble-with-the-cops---if-youre-black/2225966\">2015 Tampa Bay Times investigation</a> showing that police in Hillsborough County issued disproportionate numbers of biking tickets to blacks led to a federal inquiry. That inquiry found that the ticketing of bicyclists did not achieve any justifiable results in reducing crime or promoting public safety, and said the tickets had merely served to “burden” the county’s black residents.</p>\n<p>The Times-Union/ProPublica examination of the crosswalk tickets involved four major counties in differing corners of the state, all of which ranked among the counties that gave out the largest numbers of crosswalk tickets. We reviewed a large random sample of tickets in each county to calculate the rate of bad tickets. Extrapolating from our sample, we estimate roughly 3,500 tickets in the four counties had been given in error.</p>\n<p>Reporters used Google Street View to examine the location of each ticket to determine if it was between adjacent intersections with traffic lights.</p>\n<p>The tickets analyzed in Broward, Orange, Hillsborough and Miami-Dade counties were written by 43 different agencies including the Florida Highway Patrol. The Times-Union and ProPublica contacted the agencies in each county responsible for the highest number of the crosswalk tickets.</p>\n<p>The Coral Springs Police Department in Broward County did not deny or admit that there were problems with their citations, but said that any of the 88 citations identified by the Times-Union and ProPublica as having been given in error could be contested in court. The Orlando Police Department said they did not agree with the Times-Union/ProPublica analysis, but would not say why.</p>\n<p>The Miami Beach Police Department was the agency most willing to acknowledge that it might be getting the statute wrong.</p>\n<p>“We will gladly look over any citations that you feel were issued in error in order to identify any training needs,” said Sgt. Jack Rodriguez, of the agency’s traffic homicide and accident investigation unit.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>A spokesperson later said the agency believes it is issuing tickets correctly and that people have the ability to challenge them in court.</p>\n<p>In Jacksonville, the sheriff’s office said it also used pedestrian tickets as a way to stop and question people suspected of criminal activity. The tickets, the officials said, gave officers probable cause to do so. Fifty-five percent of those given tickets in Jacksonville in recent years were black, despite African Americans making up just 29 percent of the population. The Times-Union/ProPublica examination prompted some local lawmakers and civil rights leaders to accuse the police of a form of racial profiling and called for a suspension to all pedestrian tickets until a formal investigation was conducted.</p>\n<p>Gordon Weekes, assistant public defender for Broward County, said he worried a kind of targeted enforcement was going on in his county involving the cross walk statute. The Sunrise Police Department, for example, gave out 130 crosswalk tickets in recent years along a stretch of West Oakland Park Boulevard that includes a bus stop and a Wal-Mart store. The tickets were given largely to people who rely on public transportation in the majority black neighborhood, despite the fact there were not the required adjacent intersections with traffic lights. </p>\n<p>“That neighborhood being so closely located to a Walmart, so closely located to a bus stop, seems to suggest that it is a targeting of a particular class of neighborhood,” Weekes said.</p>\n<p>Sunrise Police did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the citations, the Times-Union and ProPublica discovered a number of criminal cases that started with crosswalk tickets that didn’t comply with state law and then lead to additional charges. Several were in Broward County.</p>\n<p>Weekes, the public defender from Broward, said the charges emanating from flawed tickets show “the pervasiveness at which police officers are willing to use areas of the statute that give them authority to have contact with someone.”</p>\n<p>“What other piece of information could an officer have to make a stop with someone to find drugs or some other form of criminality than them just walking?” Weekes said. “It seems like the race may be the driving force and then once the contact is made, the officers are then looking for some lawful basis to justify that stop.”</p>\n<p>Bobby DuBose, the second-highest ranking Democrat in Florida’s House of Representatives, said he found the Times-Union/ProPUblica findings “unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot to take in,” he said. “I have a whole lot of questions, I have a whole lot of concerns.  But on the face of it, this is very disappointing, it’s disturbing and it’s problematic. If everything that my gut is telling me is correct, then we need to do something to remedy it.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7788002.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/peter-elkind\">Peter Elkind</a> </p>\n<p>The idea seems like the perfect marriage of environmentalism and capitalism: Landowners give up their right to develop a piece of property, and in exchange they receive a special tax deduction. Nature is preserved and everybody benefits.</p>\n<p>That’s traditionally how what are known as “conservation easements” worked. In California’s Napa Valley, for example, a former biology professor and museum director named Giles Mead agreed not to develop 1,318 hilltop acres in 1983 and got a deduction in return. The property, Mead Ranch, features vernal pools and rare and endangered plants. Two entirely new species were discovered there. Bears, bobcats and mountain lions roam the grounds. Mead allowed groups of hikers, birders, and plant enthusiasts to visit. He sometimes greeted them with glasses of wine from the family’s vineyard. Since Mead’s death, his daughter has kept the property available to the public.</p>\n<p>A growing number of recent easement donations, however, are driven by a more commercial reward — an outsized tax deduction for wealthy investors. Known as “syndications” (or “syndicated partnerships,” since they’re typically offered in that structure), they’re deals orchestrated by middlemen with the goal of big payoffs for all of the participants, many of whom have never visited the land in question.</p>\n<p>One example: the former Millstone Golf Course outside of Greenville, South Carolina. Closed back in 2006, it sat vacant for a decade. Abandoned irrigation equipment sat on the driving range. Overgrowth shrouded rusting food and beverage kiosks. The land’s proximity to a trailer park depressed its value. In 2015, the owner put the property up for sale, asking $5.8 million. When there were no takers, he cut the price to $5.4 million in 2016.</p>\n<p>Later in 2016, however, a pair of promoters appeared. They gathered investors who purchased the same parcel at the market price and, with the help of a private appraiser, declared it to be worth $41 million, nearly eight times its purchase price. Why? Because with that new valuation and a bit of paperwork, the investors were suddenly able to claim a tax deduction of $4 for each $1 they invested.</p>\n<p>Such transactions are booming today, transforming an incentive for charitable gifts into a windfall for the wealthy looking to save big on their taxes. The provision they’re exploiting is the single most generous charitable deduction in the tax code, according to experts.</p>\n<p>The use of syndicated easement deductions has exploded in recent years, according to Brookings Institution economist Adam Looney, who began researching the subject while serving as a top tax official in the Obama Treasury Department. They cost the Treasury between $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion, he estimates, in lost tax revenue last year.</p>\n<p>That’s a negligible sum for the federal government — but it’s a proxy for a bigger, more systemic problem. There are plenty of other flawed provisions in the tax code that create opportunities for abuse, says Bill Hutton, an emeritus tax law professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. They often take years to surface — and many more to shut down. “The tax shelter advisors’ mentality just seems to live forever,” Hutton says. “Shelters keep coming back.”</p>\n<p>That makes the treatment of syndicated easements a telling prism through which to view the tax system at a moment in which Congress has been frantically redrafting the tax laws. It’s also a case study in how difficult it can be to turn the rhetoric about draining Washington’s swamps into reality. Even as Republicans scrambled to find revenue to underwrite their tax cut — legislation that they claimed would reform and simplify the system — they permitted syndicated easements to survive intact.</p>\n<p>And the 1,000-page bill is likely to open up costly new loopholes, according to experts. “It clearly is going to create artificial incentives to engage in transactions that have no economic purpose other than to reduce taxes,” says Looney. “The abuses in the new tax bill are going to make the costs of conservation easements seem trivial in comparison.”</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>The Basics of Conservation Easements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To be eligible for a deduction, land needs to meet at least one of four broadly defined “conservation purposes.” These include protecting “relatively natural” habitats; historic sites or buildings; land for public recreation or education; and open space (including farms, ranches and forests). </p></li>\n<li><p>Based on the claimed value of the easement deduction, landowners can deduct up to 50 percent of their income in one year and any remaining write-off over the succeeding 15 years; farmers and ranchers can deduct 100 percent in any period from one to 16 years. </p></li>\n<li><p>The landowner can continue to own and use the land as before, and even build on a portion of it, subject to agreed restrictions; </p></li>\n<li><p>By law, a government agency or, more often, a nonprofit land trust, must accept and administer the easement. The trust negotiates the development limits with the landowner, and enforces them in perpetuity.</p></li>\n<li><p>16 states sweeten the pot by offering state income tax credits, too.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</aside>\n<p>Conservation easements have generated controversy in the past, particularly when it came to light that private golf course owners were taking the deduction. Indeed, the nation’s current president has availed himself of such write-offs in large quantities. In 2005, Donald Trump took a $39 million deduction on his private golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. In 2014, he donated an easement on an 11.5-acre driving range in Los Angeles. (In both cases, he pledged not to build houses on the property.) All told, Trump has made at least five easement gifts, generating more than $100 million in write-offs.</p>\n<p>But Trump’s deductions are relatively tame compared to the aggressive strategies employed by others in recent years. A change in tax laws encouraged enterprising promoters to reap deductions many times the size of the investment, on behalf of investors who hadn’t previously owned the properties in question. A preliminary IRS analysis of syndicated partnerships this summer showed investors claimed an average of $9 in tax deductions for every dollar they put in.</p>\n<p>People have accomplished that by exploiting a giant loophole: The size of the tax deduction is based on a claim about how much the land’s value is diminished by the promise not to develop it. By law, that estimate is delivered by an appraiser hired by the taxpayer. The appraiser is free to assert that the donated land is actually worth many times what investors paid for it, often just months earlier. That, in turn, inflates the deduction. The process is abetted by law firms, brokers and accountants who pocket millions in fees.</p>\n<p>“They’re bogus,” says tax expert Steve Small of syndicated easements. Small helped write the charitable-gift rules at the IRS and is now a tax attorney in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “They’re tax shelters masquerading as conservation easement transactions, based on highly inflated appraisals. Someone’s using a charitable contribution provision of the tax code to make a profit. That’s not what any charitable contribution is designed to do.” Former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, a sponsor of the legislation that updated the easement write-off, agrees. “Unfortunately, people have taken advantage of the code in ways that were not intended,” he says. “These things should not be legal.”</p>\n<p>One reason abuses have multiplied is that a surprising amount of the oversight consists of the honor system. The genteel guardians of the old-line conservation community pledged to try to keep practitioners in line. But they’ve been unable to rein in the syndicators, whose rise they have watched with growing horror.</p>\n<p>The traditionalists are embodied by the Land Trust Alliance, a Washington, D.C., association whose dues-paying membership includes the vast majority of the nonprofit trusts that, by law, administer conservation easements. (See sidebar, below.) The Alliance has long been the most important advocate for the tax break.</p>\n<p>The Alliance’s leadership now fears that public outrage over profiteering will jeopardize the deduction altogether. “These need to be shut down,” says the organization’s president, Andrew Bowman. “These few bad actors are going to give us a bad name.” Bowman’s predecessor, Rand Wentworth, calls syndications “large-scale, multi-million-dollar tax fraud.”</p>\n<p>As views harden among the traditionalists, a schism has occurred. A splinter group of land trusts has sided with the syndicators, providing a welcome home for their deals. Most prominent among the renegade land-trust leaders: Robert Keller, a brash conservation biologist in Georgia who has built an empire through syndicated easements.</p>\n<p>Unable to stop syndicators through moral suasion, the Alliance has increasingly prodded the IRS to take action. The IRS has policing power, and it wields that clout chiefly by auditing the returns of those who take the deductions. But that’s a torturously slow process and one that so far has yielded negligible results. The speed at which the syndications have increased has left the resource-starved agency looking like a befuddled mall cop lurching off his chair and trying to figure out which of the dozen teenagers simultaneously grabbing candy bars to chase down.</p>\n<p>The IRS announced a broader crackdown in December 2016. It took the rare step of branding syndicated easement deals as “listed transactions,” subject to special reporting and scrutiny. Such IRS moves usually scare off audit-wary investors. But this time, the action appears to have had little, if any, effect.</p>\n<p>The syndicators, arguing that the profit motive produces big environmental benefits, have fought back with a million-dollar public relations and lobbying offensive. That campaign produced a move to eliminate the funding for the IRS crackdown — one of multiple fronts on which a legislative battle is being waged.</p>\n<p>It might sound like an arcane matter. Yet there’s a lot at stake for all Americans: billions in tax revenue and a system that protects 56 million acres of U.S. land from being turned into resort developments and Walmarts. How has a widely derided abuse — almost universally criticized by tax experts — managed to survive repeated attempts to fix it?</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-mead-ranch-inline-view.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-mead-ranch-inline-view.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171220-mead-ranch-inline-view.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-mead-ranch-inline-view.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The view of Napa Valley from Mead Ranch, a property that was saved from development and made available to hikers, birders and plant enthusiasts.\n<span>(Courtesy of Land Trust of Napa County)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Not so many years ago, conservation easements seemed to be approaching extinction. Starting in 2003, investigative reports in The Washington Post generated clouds of scandal over the write-off. The stories exposed self-dealing at the Nature Conservancy; sham deductions taken for protecting facades on urban buildings; and jaw-dropping write-offs for golf resorts, whose chemical-doused fairways and private membership seemed at odds with the goals of protecting natural habitat and providing “significant public benefit.”</p>\n<p>The deduction seemed destined to die, or at least be sharply limited. In January 2005, Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation proposed killing the tax break for some easements and slashing it for the rest.</p>\n<p>But the Land Trust Alliance lobbied hard, promising it would do more to prevent misuse of the deduction. Prominent conservationists chimed in with support for easements. And another constituency with a mom-and-apple-pie appeal also weighed in: Farmers and ranchers, often rich in land but poor in cash, argued that the provision helped keep them in business, producing the nation’s food.</p>\n<p>As a result, rather than eliminating the easement deductions, in 2006 Congress expanded them. The updated law raised the maximum annual write-off from 30 percent to 50 percent of taxable income; farmers and ranchers were allowed to deduct 100 percent of what they make. All were given 16 years to use their full write-off.</p>\n<p>As for enforcement, Congress adopted a stance that could mostly be called “trust but don’t verify.” It accepted the industry’s promises to reform, which included a voluntary accreditation program that would set best practices for land trusts. Meanwhile, the law did mandate new training requirements for appraisers.</p>\n<p>It was left to the IRS to police conservation easement misconduct through case-by-case audits, with stiffer penalties for those found to have violated the rules. That method would prove woefully inadequate to combat the coming wave.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It’s impossible to identify the precise birthplace of the syndicated conservation easement. But it’s safe to say it became an industry in Georgia. Between 2010 and 2012, taxpayers in the Peach State claimed about 36 percent of all federal tax deductions for conservation easements — despite having only 2.5 percent of the nation’s land under easement — <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/looney_conservationeasements.pdf\">according to a report</a> published in May by Adam Looney, the former Treasury official, who is now a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Eight of the ten biggest syndicators are located in Georgia, according to his research.</p>\n<p>The syndication technique wouldn’t have spread the way it did without a confluence of people and events. They include a small-town conservation biologist and a couple of big-city ex-bankers who met after the easements law was changed — at a moment in the wake of the real estate crisis when investors began looking for ways to salvage value from land whose price had plummeted.</p>\n<p>The small town was Jasper, Georgia, pop. 3,684 (about 60 miles north of Atlanta) and the biologist was Robert Keller. In the world of land trusts, no one embraces and enables syndicated deals quite like he does. Keller, 60, is CEO of the Atlantic Coast Conservancy, where he has built a conservation empire. By his estimate, ACC oversees 80,000 acres of conserved land in 11 states.</p>\n<p>Despite the IRS’ recent crackdown, Keller expects to accept more than 80 easements this year. He did 79 in 2016. Like most land trusts, Atlantic Coast Conservancy doesn’t report the total value of its donors’ conservation deductions. But a sampling of deal documents suggests it took easements and land donations responsible for as much as $1 billion in write-offs in 2017.</p>\n<p>Keller accepts more syndications than any one and he’s utterly unapologetic. “They call me a rogue land trust,” he says. “I’m sick of people pointing an accusatory finger. I’m putting aside to the tune of about 12,000 acres a year that will never be developed. <em>Ever.</em> If I can do that, then I feel like I’m doing what I was tasked to do. I’m supposed to conserve land. What am I doing wrong? This is almost like me going to church every week, and somebody telling me I’m going to burn in hell.”</p>\n<p>During the day I spent with Keller in northwest Georgia, followed by many email exchanges and phone calls, he was charming, forthcoming and blunt. Stocky, with a red face and white beard, he was dressed in a black T-shirt, blue shorts and running shoes. His left leg bears a tattoo of a shark. On his right calf there’s a tattoo of a leopard seal. “They eat penguins,” he says.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-keller-outside-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-keller-outside-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171220-keller-outside-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171220-keller-outside-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-keller-outside-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Keller with his technical team. He defends syndicated easements, calling them a “wonderful conservation ploy.” <span>(Melissa Golden for Fortune)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Keller’s story — and a close look at some of the deals he’s embraced — explains a lot about the battle over syndicated conservation easements. For starters, in a world of nonprofit land trusts, Keller is a proud capitalist. His direct compensation from the nonprofit he heads totaled $156,750 in 2015, tax returns show. But that’s dwarfed by the $602,432 he made from Environmental Research and Mapping Facility, a side business he operates that works exclusively for his land trust.</p>\n<p>Keller served in the Navy for a decade before earning a doctorate in conservation biology at Wake Forest University. He then worked as an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, for seven years. He left in 2006, to become the executive director of the Mountain Conservation Trust, a tiny outfit in Jasper, where, says Keller, “land conservation moved at a glacial pace.” Keller’s stock in trade, he says, was the expertise he’d picked up in the Navy about satellite-based global information systems, which allows him to survey land sites virtually anywhere in the U.S. “I wanted to expand and do more things,” he says. “They wanted to putter along.”</p>\n<p>Keller’s ambitions didn’t find the right vehicle until about 2009, when two former Wachovia bankers rolled into Jasper from Atlanta. They pitched Keller on the idea of exploiting the devastated real estate market by urging developers and lenders to recoup some of their losses through partnerships donating “monetized easements” (Keller’s preferred term). Notes Keller: “Most of these people would never have talked to a conservation biologist if the economy hadn’t turned down because they were going to turn it all into a subdivision and make a bunch of money.”</p>\n<p>The ex-bankers needed a nonprofit to accept easement gifts, and they had struggled to get a land trust on board. Keller smelled opportunity. He convinced his board to take a look.</p>\n<p>They didn’t like what they saw. In December 2009, the board of the Mountain Conservation Trust asked Keller to resign. Cody Laird, then one of its directors, says Keller was proposing accepting easements with “excessive appraisals” that went “against the IRS guidelines.” He adds, “It’s something we didn’t want to do as a board.” (Keller denies the allegation and blames the move on “a personality conflict.”)</p>\n<p>In 2010, Keller set up Atlantic Coast Conservancy, and began to accept “monetized” easements. By then, the Georgia syndication industry had begun to flourish. It touted itself with the get-rich-quick appeal of an infomercial. “Thinking about tax deductions for this year?” began one marketing email from a promoter called Forever Forests. “Contact us right now for more information on how you can facilitate a conservation easement and get incredible tax benefits for doing so.”</p>\n<p>For the promoters, the deals were lucrative, often generating $1 million or more in fees per transaction. New entrants rushed in from careers in banking, real estate, law and accounting. In Georgia, they included a former lieutenant governor and a former state senator, even a practicing dentist.</p>\n<p>The new syndication businesses typically had earth-friendly names: ForEverGreen, EvrGreen, EcoVest, Webb Creek. They set up websites featuring images of forests, waterfowl, and mountain streams. Their text proclaimed their principals’ deep concern about the fate of the earth. For example, Frank Schuler, president of Ornstein-Schuler, among the most active promoters, describes a personal epiphany that he says spurred his move into the conservation easement business after a decade in Atlanta commercial real estate. In an interview, Schuler recalls driving with his toddler son past a large residential development where the site had been bulldozed. “Every square foot was going to be paved. There were no trees. My son said, ‘Dad, that’s <em>pollution!</em>’” Says Schuler: “The importance of conserving land for him and future generations really pushed me to this point. … That’s why today I’m so passionate about conservation.”</p>\n<p>But returns were front and center in marketing pitches. Eco Terra’s website, for example, offered the motto “Be Green, Make Green.” The website for a law firm that handles easements displayed a chart listing its clients’ high-end demographics: It said 92.5 percent had a net worth over $10 million. A 2015 summary for one fund reported that it was on track to deliver a return of 89 percent for the year.</p>\n<p>The Land Trust Alliance became alarmed about the growing syndication-easement movement, fearing that it would generate a fresh wave of scandal and Congressional outrage. But syndications also posed a ticklish internal situation for the Alliance. Some of its members were an essential part of the chain that made the deals possible.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Russ Shay, the Alliance’s public policy director, privately urged IRS officials to crack down on the syndicators through more aggressive action than individual audits — perhaps by issuing a public advisory. But the IRS remained silent. (The agency declined to make officials available for on the record interviews for this article.)</p>\n<p>To be sure, the agency was auditing dozens of conservation easements; they were among the most litigated issues in federal tax court. But the case-by-case enforcement had limited impact. And given the years it took to pursue a case, says Shay, the result “is they were solving yesterday’s problem.” He adds, “They did not seem interested in solving the problem of the present — which we told them was much bigger.”</p>\n<p>Deep budget cuts left the IRS with limited resources for the costly task of disputing an appraisal, which often required hiring outside experts. “The IRS is outgunned,” says Steve Small, the former IRS attorney. “They don’t have the budget or personnel to audit a fraction of these transactions.”</p>\n<p>The IRS also lost some key battles. In one challenge to a $30.6-million golf course deduction taken in 2002 — but not resolved until 2009 — the presiding tax court judge allowed 94 percent of the write-off. Claud Clark III, a folksy Alabamian who had appraised the coastal property and defended the deduction in court, became the syndicators’ star expert. Marketing materials hailed him as the man who beat the IRS.</p>\n<p>Promotional documents for syndicated deals always acknowledge the risk of an IRS audit, which can result in an assessment for back taxes, interest and stiff penalties. Recent Ornstein-Schuler marketing materials, for example, say the firm assumes “all partnerships will be audited,” but that it trusts its “conservative, defensible valuations …” It noted: “As of 3/13/17, approximately 11 percent of the partnerships have been audited and none of the valuations have ever been reduced as a result of an IRS examination or review.” Syndication deals routinely include a six-figure “audit reserve” for battling the IRS. A few even offer “audit insurance” to help offset any disallowed write-offs.</p>\n<p>To many investors, the promise of a fat deduction seems worth the remote peril of a government audit. “If there’s a day of reckoning,” noted Small, “it’s way, way, way out in the future.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-river-west-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-river-west-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171220-river-west-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-river-west-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A bridge crossing at the former Millstone Golf Course in Greenville, South Carolina, whose value rose by a factor of eight when it was donated as a conservation easement.\n<span>(Courtesy of Ethos Projects)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>By 2013, Atlantic Coast Conservancy’s “monetized” business was booming. Keller accepted 49 easements that year, and established a branch operation in Mobile, Alabama. He began staging promotional seminars around the Southeast with such agenda topics as: “Turning an Easement into a Source of Liquidity” and “Defending the Tax Audit from Examination through Litigation.”</p>\n<p>Keller had also applied for formal accreditation from the Land Trust Alliance, through a painstaking process that required him to submit reams of documents and a $12,000 application fee. Keller was an Alliance devotee, donating to the organization and faithfully attending its seminars. He was confident about measuring up to its rigorous standards. Noted Keller in a website posting: “Obtaining the prestigious Land Trust Alliance seal of accreditation … makes a public statement that ‘we do things right!’”</p>\n<p>But by this point, the Alliance had issued a memo counseling its members to reject gifts with “grossly inflated appraisals,” regardless of the land’s conservation virtues. As the memo put it, “The public has entrusted us to act on its behalf. Enabling abuse endangers that confidence.”</p>\n<p>The Alliance was concerned by the practices described in Keller’s application. In an August 13, 2013, call, accreditation commission chairman Larry Kueter, a Colorado attorney who had reviewed Keller’s submissions, questioned him and his directors about “troubling” appraisals on several easements. “In all of the applications when I’ve been on the commission, I haven’t asked a question like this before,” Kueter said, according to a recording of the conversation that Keller made and provided to ProPublica.</p>\n<p>Almost every easement appraisal he had reviewed, Kueter said, “just showed a really significant, significant increase … within not real long periods of time. <em>One</em> of these I wouldn’t have thought twice about it. …But here we saw it four or five times. … The pattern was concerning.”</p>\n<p>In one transaction, Kueter noted, the valuation soared “from $300,000 to $1.7 million in 15 months at the back end of the real estate crisis. And I’m thinking I would have asked the appraiser … ‘How do you get to that kind of a judgment?’”</p>\n<p>Keller countered that a land trust has no legal obligation to challenge an appraiser’s professional judgment. “Roaming around in the appraisal is not something that we do,” explained Keller on the call. “We feel like we’re giving tax advice if we do.”</p>\n<p>Keller’s argument was not well-received. “I’m not sure there’s more to talk about that on this call,” Kueter finally said. The Alliance, he said, believes land trusts have a “duty of inquiry” as part of their obligation to participate in “credible transactions.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the conversation, Keller says, it was clear “they were not going to let us through.” He withdrew his application for accreditation.</p>\n<p>This setback, however, didn’t seem to hurt the Atlantic Coast Conservancy’s business, as syndicators rejected by other land trusts brought even more deals to him. Their easements have protected “gorgeous land,” says Keller. “It turned out to be this wonderful conservation ploy. … For me, as a conservation biologist, this is the best.”</p>\n<p>In a typical syndicated deal, the investor partnership has acquired the property within the past year or two, presumably from a seller determined to get what it’s worth. How, then, can an appraiser conclude its value has suddenly multiplied eight or 10 times from what the partnership paid for it?</p>\n<p>Under federal regulations, an appraisal must offer an opinion on the land’s fair market value — the price a knowledgeable buyer would pay a knowledgeable seller when neither is desperate to make a deal. But when it comes to conservation easements, syndication appraisers typically claim there are no comparable area sales. So they use a more subjective approach (albeit one that often includes reams of complex projections and reports): They try to estimate what the land would be worth if put to its most profitable legal use — as, say, a development of resort homes. Under tax court rulings, this transformation is supposed to be “reasonably probable” to occur in the “reasonably near future” and not rely on “mere speculation and conjecture.”</p>\n<p>Based on a skeletal development plan, consulting studies commissioned by the promoter, and an array of optimistic assumptions, the appraiser then projects the development costs and profits for the imagined business. On syndicated deals this invariably results in a sky-high valuation — a calculation of what the investors are giving up and can thus claim as a deduction — that makes everyone a hefty profit.</p>\n<p>The syndicated easement on the old Millstone Golf Course in South Carolina, donated to the Atlantic Coast Conservancy, illustrates how this works. The project was the brainchild of two attorneys, Hank Didier and Andrew Speaker. The men had formed their company, Ethos, in 2016. This was their first easement deal together. Their partnership would split a few months after the donation was made.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Didier was a Florida personal injury lawyer who had previously started two other businesses: one represented companies pursuing claims from the BP oil spill; another counseled injury victims on how to cash out on long-term settlement awards.</p>\n<p>Speaker was best known for causing an international uproar in 2007. Then a personal injury lawyer in Atlanta, he’d defied health officials by traveling to Europe and back after being informed that he’d contracted a highly drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis. The incident prompted congressional hearings and multiple lawsuits.</p>\n<p>The old golf course property, four miles outside of Greenville and renamed River West, had been for sale since January 2015. CBRE had marketed it as a development site, approved for 2,136 residential units and 172,500 square feet of commercial space, at $5.8 million. When it didn’t sell, the firm cut the asking price to $5.4 million — about $22,000 an acre. That’s when Didier and Speaker entered the picture. They raised $9.8 million from 52 investors.</p>\n<p>The two men hired Claud Clark, who concluded that the property’s most profitable use was as a gated community with 1,404 single-family homes. Among the heady assumptions: The home lots would sell for $60,000 apiece, and be gone in six years.</p>\n<p>Although the outcome was usually pre-ordained, Ethos, like most syndicated promoters, formally offered investors three options: to develop homes on the site; to hold it for “long-term appreciation”; or to donate 185 acres for a conservation easement. According to Clark’s preliminary appraisal, the “conservation option” would justify a $40 million deduction. That’s a value of more than $215,000 an acre — almost ten times the price at which the land had been offered for sale just months earlier. This choice would reward each of the partnership’s $25,000 investors with a $100,000 federal tax write-off.</p>\n<p>Local real estate experts express shock at this valuation. “It wasn’t anything that was going to sell,” says Frank Hammond, a Colliers International commercial broker with 30 years’ experience in the Greenville market. “It’s in a blue-collar service area, with very little in the way of upper-income demographics. It’s a rough piece of dirt in an area that isn’t sought after very much right now.” A list of comparable sales showed only four tracts of 100 to 200 acres that had sold in the area over the past three years. The most expensive had brought about $8,400 an acre.</p>\n<p>The premise of lofty syndication appraisals is that the promoters have suddenly discovered something on the land that multiplies its value, or come up with a sure-fire, highly profitable development idea that no one else contemplated. In the real world, experts say, that rarely happens. “Real estate is actually a very efficient market,” says Wentworth, the former chief of the Land Trust Alliance. “There’s a vast amount of local knowledge about what a thousand acres of pine trees in central Georgia is worth. People did not just fall off a turnip truck.”</p>\n<p>In an interview, Didier called the old golf course site “a great property” that had been “completely recaptured by nature” and defended its valuation. “The $40 million is what the value of the property is with the development on it,” he said. “I could absolutely build those homes and make a god-awful amount of money for my investors. If they [had] elected that, we would be ready to go.” (Speaker declined comment for this story; Clark didn’t respond to calls.)</p>\n<p>Stratospheric valuations for syndicated easements don’t always depend on a theory that a wildly profitable housing development could be sold on the spot. Increasingly, promoters have been declaring high valuations for parcels of land that sit on top of sand and rock, which they claim could be lucratively mined.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2015, promoters from ForEverGreen Group, based in Atlanta, contacted Judy Steckler, who runs the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain. They had a piece of land they wanted to conserve: 203 acres along the Pearl River, near the Louisiana border.</p>\n<p>Steckler took a team to inspect the tract. Much of it was covered in cypress pond swamp, prone to flooding, with wetlands habitat. There was also a good bit of sand, reputed to be of high quality for oil and gas fracking. The property sat inside the boundaries of an operating quarry. Steckler concluded that the property met her trust’s conservation standards.</p>\n<p>She advised ForEverGreen that she was prepared to accept the easement, pending some standard reviews. But days later, Steckler says, a friend forwarded her a private placement memo seeking investors for the deal. The document said the property had an estimated appraised value of $160 million — $786,000 an acre.</p>\n<p>Steckler was gobsmacked. “I’m familiar with what that land sells for,” she says. “There is no piece of property I know in the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the six coastal counties that would ever sell for that much.” (A 240-acre parcel nearby had sold just months earlier for $2,125 an acre.) Steckler pulled out of the deal.</p>\n<p>There was another land trust that had no problem with the donation: Atlantic Coast Conservancy. Keller says he didn’t care about the size of the write-off, and found the wetlands there interesting. In a detailed email, he said the area is also the most likely habitat of the storied — but long-unseen — Ivory-billed Woodpecker.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-acc-binders-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-acc-binders-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171220-acc-binders-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171220-acc-binders-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-acc-binders-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Binders featuring paperwork for easements all over the Southeast in the Atlantic Coast Conservancy offices in Jasper, Georgia\n<span>(Melissa Golden for Fortune)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Although an environmental study of the site found “a high percentage of land area in wetlands”—which would add extra costs for any commercial operation — mining was the basis for the site’s stratospheric valuation. Investor documents show the appraisal, conducted by star appraiser Claud Clark, relied on two expert studies, which concluded that the land’s most valuable use was to mine for fracking sand. (It was not clear why the original landowners, who were operating the surrounding quarry, wouldn’t want to mine the site themselves.) Nevertheless, in its 2015 tax return, Atlantic Coast Conservancy listed the value of the Mississippi land, which was ultimately donated as an outright gift rather than as an easement, as $170 million — more than $835,000 an acre.</p>\n<p>As time went on, syndicators became more audacious. Some began acquiring large tracts of land themselves, then selling it in pieces to investors they recruited, who then used it to extract easement deductions. The two-step process had the effect of inflating the values even higher (and letting the syndicators make money on the sale, too).</p>\n<p>In central Florida’s Polk County, for example, entities controlled by Ornstein-Schuler bought the County Line Ranch, a 3,475-acre tract once owned by a citrus baron. They then carved it into 20 parcels and began selling them to investor partnerships run by Ornstein-Schuler and three other syndicators. Nine separate partnerships, all of them listing their address as a drop box at a Lakeland, Florida, UPS store, then donated easements to Keller’s land trust in December 2015. Eleven new partnerships followed a similar pattern in 2016.</p>\n<p>In a matter of weeks, the land’s value jumped from $3,500 and $6,500 per acre (its listing prices before the syndicators bought the land in two pieces) to about $20,000 an acre (the price at which the syndicators resold it to their investors) to more than $200,000 an acre (the claimed easement deduction). Once all that was accomplished, most of the partnerships gave away the land, earning one final, much smaller, deduction on its residual value.</p>\n<p>The valuations defy common sense, say mining experts, who rejected the stated claims that the parcels could each be developed into highly profitable limestone mines. Dean Saunders, a commercial broker who listed the County Line Ranch for years, says a previous owner tried to sell it in 2008 as a potential mining site for $10,000 an acre, but found no takers. He “realized the economics didn’t justify trying to mine,” says Saunders. He calls the $200,000 per acre appraisal “a farce and a travesty and an abuse of the system.” (Schuler defends the transaction, saying his company relied on “qualified, independent experts” who concluded that “profitable limestone mining operations were feasible.”)</p>\n<p>For his part, Keller calls it a “heck of a project.” He says the area’s avian and amphibian diversity is “amazing” and that the land will also help protect the endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow. “If I can provide habitat for that. … I think I’m doing a heck of a good job.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As Keller’s syndication business mushroomed, so did his conflict with the Land Trust Alliance. Keller blamed the group for growing aversion to the promoters within the conservation community. In 2014, Keller heard scuttlebutt that Heather Benham of the Athens Land Trust had voiced qualms about syndication at a public forum. He shot her an email seeking “any and all” correspondence with the Land Trust Alliance on the issue. Keller also blamed the Alliance for Judy Steckler’s decision to pull out of the ForEverGreen deal. (Steckler says it played no role.)</p>\n<p>In 2015, Keller tried to convince Chuck Roe, a former Land Trust Alliance executive who he’d hired as a consultant, to launch a rival trade association. Roe declined. He says he recognized that it would be an advocate for syndications, which he calls “horrifying.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the year, Congress once again addressed easements. The 2006 law that expanded the deduction had actually been temporary and had been renewed periodically since then. But in December 2015, even as concern mounted about syndications, Congress decided to make the enhanced deduction permanent.</p>\n<p>In August 2016, the Land Trust Alliance officially barred all accredited land trusts — and later, all of its members — from accepting syndicated easements. It urged avoidance of deals that are managed by a paid promoter, involve land acquired within the past 36 months, and claim deductions of more than 2.5 times the property’s acquisition cost.</p>\n<p>The Alliance’s position forced land trusts to choose sides. In 2016, the Georgia-Alabama Land Trust, an accredited and influential group which had previously accepted syndicated deals, broke off discussions to accept another from a previous donor. Keller accepted the easement instead.</p>\n<p>Keller dismisses concerns about “hyper-inflated” easement values, declaring it “something the Land Trust Alliance made up” as part of a “smear campaign.” He says he knows the promoters bringing him easements are “in this for the money,” but he says his mission is to conserve land. “At the end of the day,” he says, “I don’t care if they get their tax benefit or not.”</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<div>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tax-plan-mega-gift-richest-trump-appointees\">\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171109-estate-tax-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171109-estate-tax-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171109-estate-tax-3x2.jpg 1200w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171109-estate-tax-3x2.jpg\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tax-plan-mega-gift-richest-trump-appointees\">The Tax Plan’s Mega Gift to Some of Trump’s Richest Appointees</a></h3>\n<h4>The Republican proposal will not only allow them to pass millions (or billions) to their heirs without inheritance taxes, it will also add another benefit on top of that.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>Last December, the IRS finally took a more systematic step. The agency issued a formal notice branding virtually all profit-making syndicated deals as abusive. Anyone who had served as a promoter or material advisor on any deal dating back to January 2010 was required to file special forms, allowing the IRS to red-flag and scrutinize the transactions. This was intended to deter such deals and to lay the groundwork for future punitive action. The IRS has “listed” just two such tax-avoidance transactions since 2009.</p>\n<p>Under most circumstances, such a move by the IRS would have sent a jolt of fear through anybody contemplating a syndicated easement. But the syndicators were not inclined to back down.</p>\n<p>Instead, they marshaled their resources and girded for a fight. A few months before, Frank Schuler had formed the rival advocacy group Keller had contemplated, calling it the Partnership for Conservation (“permanently conserving important lands in the U.S.”). It has spent $650,000 on lobbyists since its inception. EcoVest Capital — the single most prolific syndicator — has invested another $1.13 million on lobbyists. Those riches bought the services of top-tier advocates, such as former deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, the industry persuaded Georgia congressman Tom Graves, whose district includes the syndication hotbed of Rome, to slip a rider into the federal appropriations bill that would bar the IRS from spending money to enforce the listing notice. (A spokesperson for Graves said via email that constituents had expressed concerns that the IRS notice would have a “chilling effect” on conservation.) The provision passed in the House but has not been voted on yet in the Senate.</p>\n<p>The next legislative volley, months later, came from the traditionalists: In November, two representatives introduced a separate bill to kill syndications.</p>\n<p>In the final months of 2017, all attention turned to the tax bill, which became the ultimate field of battle for all tax matters. Again, the syndicators emerged unscathed — the easement rules were untouched — and it doesn’t appear to have been a close call.</p>\n<p>The anti-syndications contingent may still ultimately prevail. Yet every time the issue has reached Congress so far, the result has been to preserve or strengthen the deduction. It might not quite qualify as the cockroach of the tax code — the provision that survives every calamity — but it will take a lot to kill it.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7787220.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ian-macdougall\">Ian MacDougall</a> </p>\n<p>At an event last Thursday to tout his administration’s efforts to rid the federal government of what he contends is burdensome red tape, President Donald Trump used oversized gold scissors to cut a piece of red ribbon strung between two stacks of paper.</p>\n<p>In short order, he promised, his administration would excise some 165,000 of the more than 185,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>\n<p>That’s no easy task. Changing federal regulatory laws can mean a congressional slog. And for federal agencies to rescind rules, they must engage in a time-consuming process that opens them to public scrutiny and potential legal challenges.</p>\n<p>But there are ways to get around these impediments. Collectively, you might call them dark deregulation.</p>\n<p>Here are five techniques being used by the Trump administration.</p>\n<h3>The Data Dump</h3>\n<p>An agency can’t regulate blind. Deprive a regulator of information, and it can’t do much.</p>\n<p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforces workplace discrimination laws. In September 2016, it <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/9-29-16.cfm\">announced</a> that it would require certain larger employers to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161201205623/https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/upload/component-1-and-2-sample-2017-eeo1-report.pdf\">report</a> wage and hour data by gender, ethnicity and race. “Collecting pay data is a significant step forward in addressing discriminatory pay practices,” Jenny Yang, who was the EEOC’s chair, said at the time.</p>\n<p>This August, the White House budget office suspended the plan indefinitely while the office reviews it. The decision relied on an obscure law called the Paperwork Reduction Act. Passed in 1980, Congress intended it as a way to cut down on interminable compliance requirements. But from the beginning, opponents warned it would make it harder for agencies to do their jobs. In a <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/Utilities/Review_and_Stay_Memo_for_EEOC.pdf\">letter</a> to the EEOC, Neomi Rao — the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs — wrote that the EEOC’s plan to collect salary data “lack[ed] practical utility” and was “unnecessarily burdensome.”</p>\n<p>Although the hold on collection of salary data is not permanent, <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/press-releases/the-administrations-stay-of-pay-data-collection-rule-sweeps-unequal-pay-under-the-rug-says-nwlc/\">equal-pay</a> <a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/article/white-house-decision-on-data-collection/\">organizations</a> read Rao’s letter as the death knell for the data collection effort, which they expect will hinder the government’s ability to bring discrimination cases against employers. Organizations representing employers have argued it won’t since the salary data was too generic to allow the EEOC to detect wage discrimination accurately anyway.</p>\n<p>This use of the Paperwork Reduction Act may not be a one-off. Rao <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-md49z1SuFU?t=42m9s\">signaled</a> recently that her staff was likely to continue to wield the law to limit agency initiatives to gather information.</p>\n<h3>The Enforcement Strike</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, just doing less adds up to deregulation, in a form that’s difficult to identify and even harder to challenge in court.</p>\n<p>Two studies of Securities and Exchange Commission data published last month offer an illustration. A <a href=\"https://www.cornerstone.com/Publications/Reports/SEC-Enforcement-Activity-2017-Update\">report</a> by researchers at New York University and Cornerstone Research, a consulting firm, observed a steep slide in new enforcement actions against publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries during the first six months of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s tenure. An <a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=14209508106909000810011408407312311301404209500008909112108608509407201212102700009211903402200800902405012700506510000111802800600703707308101509912308812202509805404908010307508211108211601611600001707\">analysis</a> by Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University, found a similar decline in new actions brought against public Wall Street financial firms and subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>That pattern sets Clayton apart from two SEC chairs appointed by President Barack Obama, Mary Schapiro and Mary Jo White, Velikonja said. Data she shared with ProPublica show that the number of new enforcement actions remained roughly steady or rose in the months after Schapiro and White took office, in 2009 and 2013 respectively.</p>\n<p>The 2017 data indicates that “something has changed,” Velikonja said. “Why it changed is a much more complicated narrative.”</p>\n<p>At a conference earlier this fall, Steven Peikin, who co-directs the SEC’s Enforcement Division, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-signals-pullback-from-prosecutorial-approach-to-enforcement-1509055200\">suggested</a> that the agency may start pursuing fewer cases, devoting resources only to those cases that “send a broader message.” (Peikin’s co-director, Stephanie Avakian <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-avakian-2017-10-26\">has disputed</a> claims that the SEC is giving Wall Street a pass.)</p>\n<p>“What we’ve seen thus far is very surprising,” said Sara Gilley, a principal at Cornerstone. “We did not expect such a large drop-off.” But, she added, “it’s too early to tell if the change is because Clayton is going after big cases,” which would take time to build, or for some other reason, like the SEC simply cutting back on enforcement.</p>\n<h3>The Budget Squeeze</h3>\n<p>The White House’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/30/presidential-executive-order-reducing-regulation-and-controlling\">decision</a> to impose a so-called “regulatory budget” on government agencies is one of its more innovative moves to shrink the footprint of the federal bureaucracy. Each agency’s allotment creates a sort of deregulatory cap-and-trade system designed to force the agency to make it cheaper for the private sector to comply with rules.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>The budget flows chiefly through the White House budget office — and, in particular, Rao’s regulatory affairs staff — often called the “gatekeeper” of the administrative state, which does such wonkish work that it draws little public attention or pushback. “We’re small but mighty,” Rao <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-md49z1SuFU?t=51m12s\">said</a> of her staff at an October event at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington.</p>\n<p>The regulatory budget caps the costs an agency can impose on industry each year through rule-making. No matter the social benefit of the new rule, the agency has to offset the cost of complying with it by reducing what it costs to comply with at least two existing rules.</p>\n<p>“A regulatory budget could have the most far-reaching impact of any executive branch regulatory reform” since the Ford administration, researchers at the Brookings Institution <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/evaluatingtrumpregreform_gayerlitanwallach_102017.pdf\">wrote</a> in October.</p>\n<p>The administration believes the regulatory budget is working. On Thursday, it <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-delivering-deregulation/\">reported</a> that agencies across the federal government (excluding some independent agencies, like the SEC) had slashed annual compliance costs by $570 million for the 2017 fiscal year. For 2018, the White House announced, agencies collectively will have to <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/pdf/eo13771/FINAL_TOPLINE_All_20171207.pdf\">cut annual compliance costs</a> by more than $685 million.</p>\n<h3>The Slowdown</h3>\n<p>The rush toward the end of the Obama administration to finalize lingering rules left many of them to go into effect after Jan. 20, when Trump took office. That left open a possibility the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/20/memorandum-heads-executive-departments-and-agencies\">White House</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/implementation-regulatory-freeze\">has embraced</a>: delay.</p>\n<p>It’s a lot easier to justify postponing a rule than it is to justify killing or revising it. While the agency decides the rule’s ultimate fate, the people and businesses affected are free to ignore the rule’s requirements.</p>\n<p>After a spate of miner deaths between 2013 and 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration proposed a rule to protect miners at hard rock and other non-coal mines. The rule was simple. Mine operators would have to inspect work sites for hazards before a new shift of miners began work. Previously, operators could inspect the site after work had begun.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<div>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-scuttling-a-rule-that-would-save-people-from-dying-of-carbon-monoxide-poisoning\">\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-portable-generators-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-portable-generators-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171207-portable-generators-3x2.jpg 1200w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-portable-generators-3x2.jpg\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-scuttling-a-rule-that-would-save-people-from-dying-of-carbon-monoxide-poisoning\">The Trump Administration Is Scuttling a Rule That Would Save People From Dying of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</a></h3>\n<h4>It took 16 years and more than 1,000 deaths for the Consumer Products Safety Commission to crack down on deadly portable generators. Trump’s appointees could undo that in a matter of months.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>MSHA finalized the rule in January and gave mine operators four months to comply. Since then, the agency has repeatedly delayed the rule, <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/05/22/2017-10474/examinations-of-working-places-in-metal-and-nonmetal-mines\">maintaining</a> that mine operators needed more time to come into compliance. How much time? Nearly a year and a half. The rule is now set to go into effect in June 2018.</p>\n<p>The rationale for delay doesn’t make much sense to Joseph Main, who headed MSHA during the Obama administration. During his tenure, he said, it took only a few months to get mine operators up to speed on much more complicated regulatory changes.</p>\n<p>“It was such a common-sense rule,” Main said. “It’s really simple. The time taken — the delay to train up the industry — I think is beyond belief here, to say the least.”</p>\n<p>By September, another reason for the delay had emerged: MSHA has <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/12/2017-19381/examinations-of-working-places-in-metal-and-nonmetal-mines\">proposed relaxing</a> the rule so mine operators could inspect work sites “as miners begin work.”</p>\n<h3>The Expanding Exemptions</h3>\n<p>Many agency rules include exceptions to their requirements — when or where the rule applies, to whom it applies. Interpreting exceptions expansively or using them more aggressively are ways to cut back on a rule’s practical effect without revising it or taking it off the books.</p>\n<p>Take the environmental reviews mandated by a 1970 law called the National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA requires agencies across the federal government to document the environmental impacts of major actions they plan to take. The process includes a chance for the public to comment on the government’s plans.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/15/presidential-executive-order-establishing-discipline-and-accountability\">announced</a> plans to reduce “unnecessary burdens and delays” caused by NEPA reviews. To help achieve its goal, the administration has asked federal agencies to turn to “categorical exclusions.” Those are categories of government action that don’t require an environmental review. Examples include approving construction of short natural gas pipelines and laying a bike path.</p>\n<p>Agencies are listening. Last month, for instance, a task force at the Department of Energy <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-11-01/pdf/2017-23713.pdf\">recommended</a> that the agency consider granting more categorical exclusions. It singled out as an example geothermal energy projects on federal lands. (The recommendations remain under White House review.)</p>\n<p>The NEPA process often takes months or years, and it is a longtime target of conservative groups, <a href=\"http://solutions.heritage.org/the-economy/transportation/\">which</a> <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/would-more-government-infrastructure-spending-boost-us-economy\">say</a> it needlessly delays energy and infrastructure projects and increases their cost. But environmental groups worry that an overeager turn to categorical exclusions will undermine NEPA’s core purpose.</p>\n<p>“There are communities where, but for NEPA, nobody would know a highway is going to be built,” said Scott Slesinger, the legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The idea is, when the government comes in to do something, they should look before they leap.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7776914.gif\" height=\"1\">",

In the 11th of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/propublica-illinois-staff-q-and-a\">a series of Q&amp;As with ProPublica Illinois staffers</a>, Floyd talked with ProPublica Emerging Reporter Andrea Salcedo.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired you to become a journalist?</strong></p>\n<p>I originally wanted to go into law. But after my first legal internship, I figured out it really wasn’t for me. In doing that internship I got to work with some local journalists. I got to see what they were doing and I was like, “Oh, I kind of like what you’re doing. It seems fun.” I did not know where to start so I joined the school paper and came in as the advertising manager. I didn’t have much journalism experience. While I was doing that, I was taking journalism courses to work on my writing. I thought, “Once I do that, I’ll apply for a writing position.” After that, I became features editor at the school paper at Morehouse College, then eventually ended up as managing editor. That propelled me to think, “This isn’t something I’m doing for fun anymore. This is something I want to make a career out of.”</p>\n<p><strong>What has been your most rewarding experience as a journalist?</strong></p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171219-jerrel-floyd-043-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171219-jerrel-floyd-043-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171219-jerrel-floyd-043-3x2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171219-jerrel-floyd-043-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Reporting Fellow Jerrel Floyd\n<span>(Michael Schmidt, special to ProPublica Illinois)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>When I was with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, I got to do an investigative internship there the summer after I left Morehouse College. I got to work on a project looking into doctors <a href=\"http://doctors.ajc.com/duty_to_report_sex_abuse/\">accused of sexual misconduct</a> with patients. In doing that, I saw the power of journalism. Before that, I had done some investigative stories but nothing on that level. It was getting to see what we could do in terms of storytelling. There were so many women who were just sitting on these awful stories and these awful interactions with doctors. They really didn’t have the resources they needed to get their stories out there. Being able to be a part of that and being able to tell those stories and hold the people in those positions accountable, it showcased to me how powerful and how important it is what we’re doing.</p>\n<p><strong>What stories are you interested in investigating with ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>The most exciting thing about coming here is that I have a clean slate. I don’t necessarily have a specific focus. Throughout the years, I’ve had opportunities to work on environmental reporting and looking into low-income housing. For me, it’s just taking all of those experiences, going out there and telling stories in an investigative format. I’m just excited to have the opportunity to be around these amazing reporters, learn from them and see where I want to align in terms of my investigative reporting.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are some of your journalism role models?</strong></p>\n<p>One person I’ve always had in the back of my mind is Ida B. Wells. Her experiences are so relevant. There was a lack of coverage of the issues that were affecting people that looked like her. That pushes me to keep doing what I’m doing because I want to do investigative projects that cover people who look like me or have experiences like me. In terms of writing — and this is kind of random — but for me it’s George R. R. Martin. He has such a narrative voice. That’s something I want to carry into my journalism. I want to do investigative projects, but at the same time I don’t want to neglect the writing component of it. I want to put people into the stories that I’m writing about. I always try to combine the Ida B. Wells component in terms of covering racial inequality, telling stories of people that look like me, but in terms of my writing, I want to have that narrative and that immersive quality of George R. R. Martin.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you hope your stories with ProPublica Illinois will spark change?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s always the main goal with investigative journalism. You do these long projects for months, but at the end of the day, you hope that someone reads it and it changes someone’s life or it changes some kind of system. As long as someone’s story is being told, I feel like I’m happy. At the same time, I want to see things changed from the investigative projects that I do. I don’t necessarily know what that change looks like, but I want to affect something — whether it’s an institution, whether it’s a person, whether it’s a group of people. </p>\n<p><strong>What reporting and/or storytelling techniques would you like to experiment with at ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the things that I’m really excited about that I’ve never had the opportunity to do is callouts. Networking with the people out there and getting stories from them, versus waiting for that one tip from a source or waiting from that one phone call from a political official. It’s basically asking people to bring their stories to us or asking them to tell their stories of specific subjects. It’s us saying, “Hi! We are looking to cover this. Do you have stories that connect to this topic? ”It’s something ProPublica has done before, but it’s something I’ve never done before.</p>\n<p><strong>As a young reporter, what would you say are some of the advantages and challenges when pursuing journalism?</strong></p>\n<p>There are these moments when I come at certain issues from a different perspective than from a lot of the veteran reporters. That’s sometimes really good and sometimes really bad. When getting from point A to point B in a story, I could take different loops and obstacles to get to point B, but then the veteran reporters sometimes tell me, “All you had to do was hop and you could have got to point B.” The beauty of it is I can admit that I still have a lot to learn, but I’m in a great place where I can learn it. </p>\n<p><strong>What has been the biggest lesson journalism has taught you?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say persistence. There are so many twists and turns — whether it’s a Freedom of Information Act being delayed, whether it’s this person that doesn’t want to talk to you. It takes persistence not giving up, to keep reaching out to that one individual, keep focusing on that FOIA request or finding other avenues to get the same information. Whatever investigative project you’re doing, it’s not always going to come easy. It’s not always going to be simple. You’re sometimes going to have to deviate and work around to get close to the story.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7776335.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jason-grotto\">Jason Grotto</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Ray Long</span>, Chicago Tribune </p>\n<p>A nonpartisan government watchdog group Monday announced it will push for reforms to the Cook County assessor’s office, citing Chicago Tribune/ProPublica Illinois findings that call into question the accuracy and fairness of the county’s property tax assessment system.</p>\n<p>The Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, a nonprofit advocacy group, called for oversight of the assessor’s office, an explanation from Assessor Joseph Berrios of the methods his office used to value property and a plan to address inequities.</p>\n<p>If the assessor’s office fails to take those steps, the group said the county should create an independent board to increase transparency and improve fairness and accuracy.</p>\n<p>“We think these are some pretty basic measures that are absolutely necessary for the assessor’s office to engage in,” ICPR Executive Director Sarah Brune said in an interview.</p>\n<p>In urging change, the group cited reporting from “The Tax Divide” series, which launched in the Tribune in June and has continued this month in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/the-tax-divide\">ProPublica Illinois</a>.</p>\n<p>The series showed the assessor’s office overvalued low-priced residential properties while undervaluing high-priced ones. These disparities in assessments — known as regressivity — led to inequities in property tax bills, giving the wealthy unsanctioned tax breaks while punishing low-income residents.</p>\n<p>The series found similar regressivity in commercial and industrial assessments, as well as tens of thousands of identical valuations over multiple reassessment periods, each three years apart. Experts said repeating values would be virtually impossible had Berrios done his job thoroughly.</p>\n<p>County residents have been left “wondering whether they have been treated unfairly, and why these issues were allowed to compound over many years with little oversight or accountability,” the group said.</p>\n<p>The ICPR said that of the four largest property tax jurisdictions in the country — including Los Angeles County, California; Harris County, Texas; and Maricopa County, Arizona — only Cook County fails to “conduct studies to ensure sufficiently equitable property assessments.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Assessor for Communications Tom Shaer said the ICPR’s proposal relies on findings by the Tribune and ProPublica Illinois that the office questions, though the assessor has not provided evidence to support its criticisms. Shaer also said that Berrios’ office has been working to improve the assessment system.</p>\n<p>“Assessor Berrios has been proactive in addressing problems in the system which he did not create,” Shaer wrote in a statement.</p>\n<p>The latest in a growing chorus of groups calling for changes in the county’s assessment system, ICPR made its call for change less than a week after three public interest law firms sued Berrios and the county in Cook County Circuit Court. The lawsuit alleged violations of state and federal civil rights and housing laws.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit seeks many of the same reforms pushed by the ICPR, including disclosure of the assessor’s methods and data, independent oversight of the office and new measures to ensure fair and accurate assessments.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>The assessor’s office was already under scrutiny from the county’s inspector general, who was forced to take Berrios all the way to the Illinois Supreme Court to gain access to records needed to conduct investigations of the office.</p>\n<p>In July, the County Board summoned Berrios to testify about the office’s practices, and Board President Toni Preckwinkle ordered a study of how residential assessments are done.</p>\n<p>Shaer said Berrios is open to scrutiny and change.</p>\n<p>“He is cooperating fully with the current study of property assessment being conducted for Cook County by the Civic Consulting Alliance,” he wrote in a statement. “The Assessor has committed to implementing any changes and improvements possible which are recommended by the CCA study.”</p>\n<p>Brune said her group plans to reach out to county commissioners and other community leaders to ensure changes to the assessor’s office are made.</p>\n<p>“We want to make this a priority going forward,” she said.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7770819.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/talia-buford\">Talia Buford</a> </p>\n<p>Betsy Southerland knew something was wrong the moment she walked into her office at the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n<p>It was 8 a.m. on a Thursday in April and already, her team was waiting at her door, computer printouts in hand.</p>\n<p>For months, staffers in the Office of Water had been in help-desk mode, fielding calls from states implementing a federal rule that set new limits on water-borne pollution released by coal-fired power plants. The rule on what is known as “effluent” had been hammered out over a decade of scientific study and intense negotiations involving utility companies, White House officials and environmental advocates. The EPA had checked and rechecked its calculations to make sure the benefits of the proposed change outweighed the cost to the economy.</p>\n<p>But now, members of Southerland’s team were handing her a press release, firing questions as her eyes skimmed the page. <em>Did she know about this? Had she seen it? What happened?</em></p>\n<p>The announcement from EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the agency was considering undoing the rule. “This action is another example of EPA implementing President Trump’s vision of being good stewards of our natural resources, while not developing regulations that hurt our economy and kill jobs,” the release said.</p>\n<p>Southerland was stunned. In three decades as a career staffer at the EPA, she’d never seen an administrator describe a regulation in such terms. As director of science and technology for the office, she also had never learned of such a major change of direction from a press release. She couldn’t give her team any answers. “I was as clueless as they were,” Southerland recalled.</p>\n<p>Since Trump was elected, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/climate/trump-environment-rules-reversed.html?_r=0\">dozens of environmental rules</a> have been either opened for reconsideration or overturned altogether. These regulations would have had far-ranging effects, from banning hazardous pesticides and offshore oil drilling to stopping coal-mining debris from being dumped into local streams to forbidding hunters from shooting Alaskan wolves on wildlife refuges. They would have required infrastructure projects to be built to higher flood standards and greenhouse gas emissions to be limited and tracked.</p>\n<p>ProPublica took a close look at the effluent rule, which was one of the most scrutinized and meticulously researched of the regulations the new EPA leadership is preparing to overturn. Longtime staffers and environmental experts say it is an instance in which science and prevailing industry practices were swept aside to benefit a handful of coal-fired power plants that were having trouble meeting the new standards.</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the EPA said the change of direction is part of a broader push to eliminate unnecessary federal rules.</p>\n<p>“Administrator Pruitt has made a commitment to refocus the Agency back to its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, restore power to the states through cooperative federalism, and improve processes by adhering to the rule of law,” the spokeswoman told ProPublica. “This includes a review of regulations passed by the previous administration that may impose unwarranted burdens or exceed our statutory authority.”</p>\n<p>Many of the rules were years or even decades in the making, and the sheer speed with which they’ve been cast aside has left the EPA staffers who helped craft them shaken.</p>\n<p>It has also deepened the chasm between the agency’s top decision-maker and his agency’s longtime staff. Pruitt’s opposition to EPA regulation was a defining feature of his career before he took the agency’s reins. As Oklahoma’s attorney general, he sued the EPA repeatedly and blasted its rules as overreaching. Since taking the administrator post, it’s been reported that he’s given lobbyists broad access and appointed people to key jobs who have close ties to the industries they are overseeing.</p>\n<p>To the Trump administration and its supporters, this is no more than a long overdue balancing of the scales. In any administration, one side is always happier than the other, said Fred Palmer, a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank. “They are not being listened to because they disagree with the agenda of the President of the United States who, at the end of the day, is their boss,” he said of EPA staffers, “like it or not.”</p>\n<p>Pruitt’s interaction with Southerland and her team on the effluent rule reflects the degree to which the EPA is now shutting its own staff out of the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Under previous administrations, Republican and Democratic alike, Southerland said staffers could make their case to agency leaders, presenting the scientific evidence behind rule-making proposals and other regulatory decisions. They didn’t always win the day, but they often managed to hold onto the provisions they considered most important.</p>\n<p>But under Pruitt, she and others said, EPA’s career staffers have seen their access to the agency’s leadership dwindle. More importantly, their arguments no longer have much influence on the rapid-fire series of decisions announced by Pruitt.</p>\n<p>“This has been a long-planned assault on the agency, not some serendipitous thing,” Southerland said. “(Staffers) now understand that the overall process will be to repeal everything requested by industry.”</p>\n<h3>Lagging Behind</h3>\n<p>The long road to the revamped effluent rule began in 2005.</p>\n<p>“Effluent” is wastewater that is allowed to be discharged into rivers and lakes, a byproduct of 59 different industries, from commercial animal farms and landfills to soap companies and dental offices. This wastewater often contains dangerous toxins.</p>\n<p>The Clean Water Act — a bedrock environmental protection that sought to make American waters “fishable and swimmable” — requires the EPA to set limits on toxins found in effluent. The rules must be updated every five years to keep up with advances in the technology that filters out dangerous chemicals.</p>\n<p>Within the EPA, this task belonged to the Office of Science and Technology, a team of more than 100 scientists, engineers and economists within the Office of Water who develop standards to protect water safety and recommend limits for levels of contaminants. To update the effluent limits, the team had to understand how much each industry was polluting the water, how each processed its waste and how that process was evolving.</p>\n<p>But the sheer volume of effluent-generating industries made it impossible for the office to revise the rules every five years. So, the office set priorities.</p>\n<p>Every year, the office reviewed pollutant discharges reported by companies and ranked them into categories that posed hazards to human health and the environment. In 2003, EPA’s screen found that coal plants ranked high in discharges of toxins and pollutants.</p>\n<p>To keep coal ash — the carcinogenic leftovers from burning coal — from winding up in the air, some power plants use what are called scrubbers to trap it. Those scrubbers need to be cleaned, and the residue is mixed with water and stored in ponds. To keep those ponds from overfilling, plants ultimately release effluent into nearby waterways. It’s a potentially hazardous process. Effluent from coal ash contains mercury, arsenic, lead and selenium — elements linked to an increased risk of lower IQs in children, cancer and organ damage.</p>\n<p>In the mid-’00s, when the EPA’s concern about effluent from coal ash ponds grew, federal rules were silent on these toxins. The limits focused on curbing oil, gas and total suspended solids — the visible stuff floating in coal ash wastewater. The regulations hadn’t been revised since 1982.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>There was a growing body of studies and news reports detailing the damage caused by chemical contaminants from coal plant wastewater. Researchers learned of fish turning up deformed and dead, and bullfrogs found crippled, missing entire rows of teeth. There were reports about coal ash ponds leaking and contaminating nearby groundwater. Drinking wells were poisoned in Maryland and Indiana.</p>\n<p>The office needed more data to form the basis of a new rule. It started collecting it in 2005.</p>\n<p>First, staffers needed to understand what technologies companies were using to control pollution from coal plants, how much it cost and how clean the wastewater could get. They created a 391-page <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/steam-electric_questionnaire_052010.pdf\">questionnaire</a> that would ultimately reach 733 facilities.</p>\n<p>In 2006, EPA scientists started visiting power plants to better understand how they operated. This launched eight years of study that took them to 73 facilities in 18 states. They collected samples to understand how different types of coal polluted the water and how well different treatment systems performed. Their investigation took them all the way to southern Italy, where a power plant in Brindisi was using an advanced wastewater evaporation process to protect an aquifer.</p>\n<p>By 2009, the office reported their findings, saying it was clear newer technologies were available to “significantly reduce” the presence of harmful pollutants in public water, and that existing regulations were far out of date.</p>\n<p>The office had the evidence it needed to move forward with stronger limits on coal plant effluent.</p>\n<h3>Stuck In the Middle</h3>\n<p>Even as the EPA prepared to move forward on a rule, environmentalists grew concerned about reports on coal ash wastewater. On top of that, the Obama administration was strengthening rules to keep coal plants from pumping toxins like mercury into the air. If the rule went through, coal plant scrubbers would capture even more toxins, much of which would eventually end up in coal ash ponds that would discharge effluent.</p>\n<p>“You’re taking the pollution out of the air and putting it into the water,” said Jennifer Peters, national water programs director at Clean Water Action. “That triggered concern within EPA and the environmental community wanting to ensure that they’re not just moving the pollution problem around.”</p>\n<p>Environmentalists prodded the EPA to look at the danger to both the air and the water, but officials were in the thick of revising other regulations. So in 2010, several environmental groups sued the agency to force it to get the new effluent rule out sooner.</p>\n<p>In a consent decree, reached in November 2010, the EPA agreed to propose an updated effluent rule by 2012, with a final rule coming no later than 2014. But there was a complicating factor.</p>\n<p>Another EPA branch — the Office of Land and Emergency Management — was drafting another rule about coal ash waste. Called the Coal Combustion Residuals rule, it was aimed at making sure coal ash ponds and landfills were structurally sound. The two rules needed to work in harmony, but scientists from each office had collected data in different ways. The data needed to be standardized, and distinct costs and benefits assigned to each rule. The benefits of each rule had to justify the costs — a Clinton-era reform designed to limit excessive regulation.</p>\n<p>The task fell to the Office of Science and Technology, which Southerland had just taken over after leaving another branch of the EPA. The analysis took longer than expected.</p>\n<p>“We kept asking for delays because we kept having to redo the analysis on both rules to make sure we weren’t double counting the benefits,” Southerland said.</p>\n<p>By now, her office was confident in its research, which showed some companies were using biological and chemical processes to clean wastewater. These other processes drastically reduced the toxins that ended up in the water, as well as the amount of water that needed to be released.</p>\n<p>Southerland’s office crafted a rule that set limits on the amount of toxins that could be discharged. And though it didn’t specifically forbid using coal ash ponds, the rule would have forced plants to use technologies that could meet the more stringent limits.</p>\n<p>It was time to take the proposed rule to the next phase.</p>\n<p>In January 2013, the EPA submitted it to the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a forum for other agencies to review pending regulations and for lobbyists to weigh in. OIRA is a gatekeeper for all federal rules and needs to give final approval for any rule.</p>\n<p>The substance of OIRA meetings are confidential, but public logs show that utility industry lobbyists and lawyers had ample opportunity to make their case.</p>\n<p>In the end, the Obama administration office approved coal ash ponds as the “best available technology,” contrary to EPA’s recommended option. OIRA also <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/lobbyists-bidding-block-government-regs-sights-set-secretive-white-house\">recast some</a> of the scientific findings and softened language toward coal utilities while finding that the benefits of the rule were less than the EPA had projected.</p>\n<p>When the proposed rule went out for public comment, utilities argued the EPA was underestimating its cost, that wastewater was already being addressed through other regulations and that there was no proof that newer technologies were more effective in reducing the concentration of toxins in wastewater. Environmentalists had their own complaints, pressing the agency to eliminate wastewater discharges entirely and arguing the proposed regulations would likely lead to new coal ash ponds.</p>\n<p>In all, more than 200,000 members of the public weighed in during the four-month comment period, largely due to letter-writing campaigns from environmental groups. A California woman recounted how industrial coal processing chemicals fouled water in West Virginia, leaving her friends with unsafe water for weeks. A West Virginia woman pleaded for help: “One thing’s for certain — our state oversight of this immense environmental legacy is sorely lacking and we desperately look to the EPA to stand up for us!”</p>\n<p>Industry weighed in as well, often attaching voluminous studies and additional monitoring data to their comments. Southerland said she led the team in around-the-clock analyses to see if the industry-provided data affected the calculations that went into the rule.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Southerland’s boss mounted a campaign to push OIRA to approve EPA’s original version of the rule.</p>\n<p>Ken Kopocis, a lawyer who worked on Capitol Hill for more than 25 years before Obama nominated him to lead the Office of Water, said he appealed to “high-ranking” officials in the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/oira\">OIRA</a>, and also the White House, walking them through the research.</p>\n<p>“My people in Water didn’t think we were going to be able to get the rule we wanted,” Kopocis said. “I said, ‘No, we’re going to fight for it and we’re going to get it.’ ... OIRA is full of capable people. But they don’t know as much as the agency does.”</p>\n<p>Kopocis’ strategy worked: He was able to convince OIRA to reverse its initial decision.</p>\n<p>The final rule, released on Sept. 30, 2015, substantially mirrored EPA’s original proposal, setting strict limits, for the first time, on the amount of selenium, arsenic, mercury and nitrate utilities could discharge. It didn’t prescribe a specific technology plants needed to use to achieve this goal, but it said the tougher limits couldn’t easily be met using coal ash ponds.</p>\n<p>This rule was “incredibly significant,” Kopocis said, because there’s “no dispute” that the toxins curbed by the rule are harmful. “It’s just incredible that we had all of these pollutants being put into water bodies when the technology was available to stop it.”</p>\n<p>And it turned out, most utilities had already moved to comply with the toughened rule. EPA officials found that only 12 percent, about 134 facilities, needed to update their technology.</p>\n<p>Officials knew some plant operators wouldn’t be able to afford the upgrades. “There might have been a plant or two that would have ended up closing,” Kopocis said.</p>\n<p>The EPA gave utilities years to raise the money needed to limit the toxicity of the liquid they released. The rule required them to start cleaning up their discharges by November 2018 and until 2023 to complete the transition.</p>\n<p>The rule was challenged in courts around the country. Industry lawsuits said it was too difficult to comply with the rule; environmentalist lawsuits said it needed to go further. For months, cases were in limbo as they were consolidated before a single court. Industry and environmentalists tried to compel the EPA to disclose confidential business information gathered to create the guidelines — data that could be picked apart to bolster their legal arguments. The EPA asked the court for time to prepare briefs, delaying the case to 2017.</p>\n<p>All this was pretty much par for the course for any new EPA rule.</p>\n<p>Inside the Office of Science and Technology, Southerland’s team moved forward with implementing the rule, holding webinars, writing documents and answering state regulators’ questions about how to put the guidelines into practice. They continued that work as the Obama administration ended and the Trump administration brought new leadership to the top of the agency.</p>\n<h3>Art of the Deal</h3>\n<p>Standing there on that April morning, press release in hand, Southerland didn’t panic.</p>\n<p>She had navigated setbacks under all kinds of administrations since she joined the EPA in 1984. Trained as an engineer, with a doctorate in environmental sciences and engineering, she said her instinct was to brief the administrator on the science.</p>\n<p>She gathered key staffers around a conference table and got to work.</p>\n<p>They quickly decided their old briefing documents from the Obama administration were too technical. For 90 minutes, they outlined the contours of four briefings — one each on how the rule came together, why it was affordable, why it was necessary, and the legal challenges that might arise from further revision.</p>\n<p>Southerland told her team they needed to give Administrator Pruitt “all the relevant facts,” she said, so he “could make a good decision.” He was reconsidering the rule, but before he restarted the formal rulemaking process, they hoped they could persuade him not to throw it out completely.</p>\n<p>These were their best arguments: The rule was already being widely followed by the industry. The industry claim that the rule would cause power plants to close was likely wrong — many plants lacking the appropriate technology were already slated for retirement, pushed out by the low cost of natural gas. The delayed compliance dates would give the remaining companies time to plan and pay for the shift.</p>\n<p>The team spent the rest of the day fleshing out details.</p>\n<p>“We were absolutely hopeful,” Southerland said. “We thought if anything, we could talk him into repealing just a small part of it.”</p>\n<p>They tried to get on Pruitt’s schedule, but he was booked — often with back-to-back speaking engagements, meetings and briefings with industry executives, published <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/03/us/politics/document-Pruitt-Sked-and-McCarthy-Sked.html\">calendars</a> show.</p>\n<p>While they waited to meet with Pruitt, Southerland and her team worked on those around him. For two months, they held in-person and phone briefings with EPA lawyers, high-ranking political appointees and career staffers. In meeting after meeting, they walked different officials through the development of the rule, the legal issues related to it, and the price tag for implementing it. They received no pushback from Pruitt’s lieutenants in those briefings, staffers said, and few questions.</p>\n<p>Finally, they had two briefings on July 14 and July 21 with Pruitt himself, packing all of their talking points into those one-hour time slots.</p>\n<p>Walking into the administrator’s packed conference room for the first time, their hopes were high. “We assumed we had dazzled them and this was just the finishing touch,” Southerland said.</p>\n<p>In the first briefing, the team explained how it developed the rule and calculated its costs; then, it laid out the arguments industry had raised and, point-by-point, gave potential options for solving them.</p>\n<p>Pruitt took notes and was “attentive,” Southerland said, but asked few questions.</p>\n<p>In the second briefing, the team laid out the bottom line of Pruitt’s options and the consequences of each. Reopening portions of the rule would likely mean even more stringent effluent limits down the road, since technology had improved since the final rule was released in 2015, they said. Repealing the entire rule would rollback all of the protections — even those that utilities supported.</p>\n<p>Finally, Pruitt asked if there was anything else the staff wanted to say. Staffers added that municipal water utilities had expressed concern that, without the rule, they would bear the costs of keeping effluent pollutants out of the drinking water supply. Staffers also noted that putting the rule on hold would lead to confusion for states renewing discharge permits for coal plants. When the staffers finished speaking, Pruitt thanked them. The meeting was over.</p>\n<p>On the walk to the elevator, the team was ecstatic.</p>\n<p>“We thought we made all of our points and that we couldn’t have done a better job explaining how important and affordable this rule was,” Southerland said.</p>\n<p>The EPA now had to hear from the public. In May, Pruitt had proposed delaying the deadline for coal plants to comply with the effluent guidelines while the agency considered whether to revise the rule entirely. The proposed rule triggered a public comment period, including a hearing on July 31 in which 71 people signed up to testify. Only three speakers were from industry. The rest begged for the effluent limits to remain intact.</p>\n<p>“If somebody backed a tractor trailer truck of mercury up to my lawn or your lawn and dumped it on your lawn, what would you do?” said environmental attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “You would say to them, ‘Clean it up. Clean it all up.’ And if they said to you, ‘Well, it’s too costly for us to do that,’ you would say, ‘I don’t care what the cost is. You have no right to do that, ever.’”</p>\n<p>Eleven days later, Pruitt sent <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-08/documents/steam-electric-elg_epa-letter-to-petitioners_08-11-2017.pdf\">a letter</a> to lobbying groups that had requested that the rule be reopened, announcing that the EPA would re-examine the pollution limits that the new effluent rule set for the two biggest sources of wastewater from coal plants, potentially erasing the thrust of the rule issued in 2015.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Pruitt’s office announced that “substantive portions” of the other rule to regulate coal ash ponds, the Coal Combustion Residuals rule, would be reconsidered. An EPA spokeswoman said “there were significant issues” with both rules that “justify the need to take a second look.”</p>\n<p>“We were heartbroken,” Southerland said. “We raked ourselves over the coals trying to say ‘what more could we have done?’”</p>\n<h3>Delay and Defeat</h3>\n<p>The reopened effluent rule sent ripples through the coal plant industry and beyond.</p>\n<p>In Indiana, a company that planned to install $400 million in upgrades <a href=\"http://midwestenergynews.com/2017/07/10/trump-administrations-regulatory-rollback-playing-out-at-indiana-coal-plant/\">postponed</a> seeking funding for a system that would have complied with the new pollution limits. The company, Northern Indiana Public Service Co., will “revisit... investments once the EPA completes its review,” said director of external communications Nick Meyer.</p>\n<p>The Tennessee Valley Authority — a <a href=\"https://www.tva.gov/About-TVA\">federally owned independent power company</a> — told state regulators it was holding off on installing new technology until 2023. The company said it was awaiting guidance from the state, which was waiting for the EPA. “We’re not delaying anything,” Scott Brooks, the company’s spokesman, said, “but when you have a rule that’s suspended, you go back to what was in place prior to the guidelines that were suspended.”</p>\n<p>Frontier Water Systems, which had created a <a href=\"http://frontierwater.com/how-it-works/\">system</a> for dry-handling coal ash waste, is already feeling the squeeze. The company has about 24 employees in San Diego, Salt Lake City and outside of Atlanta and is on track to do $15 million in business this year. But the company’s future is uncertain, since so much relies on when or if coal plants will be required to clean up their waste streams. One of the owners, Jamie Peters, said they’d consider selling their technology to China or another country if it’s unsustainable here.</p>\n<p>“If this rule is delayed significantly or removed, we would probably have to abandon this,” Peters said. “I don’t think we have years; we have months.”</p>\n<p>The new rulemaking process could take a few years, former officials said, since the EPA will have to collect data about the current state of wastewater technology in order to propose a replacement standard, then go through the interagency review process again and allow for more public comments.</p>\n<p>Now, Southerland is on the outside looking in. In an interview with ProPublica, Southerland, 68, said she opted to retire in August for family reasons, though she’s been an outspoken critic of Pruitt since she left.</p>\n<p>She made her farewell letter public, and it went viral.</p>\n<p>“The truth is, there is NO war on coal, there is NO economic crisis caused by environmental protection, and climate change IS caused by man’s activities,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>At her retirement party, she read the speech to the colleagues she was leaving behind — the ones tasked with orchestrating repeals of rules they crafted. Her scathing critique was both an acknowledgement of their current reality, and a plea to stay the course.</p>\n<p>“I know in my heart that the majority of Americans in this country recognize that protection of public health and safety is a right and it is just,” she said. “And so this will happen. And all of you must just wait for that day to come — whether it’s two years, three years or four years: that day will come. So, do not give up. Do not feel that your efforts are going to go to waste in these four years. Because, eventually, you will overcome.”</p>\n<p>At first, Southerland said, scientists at the agency expressed optimism that they could prevent rules they’d spent their careers to advance from being weakened or scrapped. But as time wears on, she said, that hope is fading.</p>\n<p>More than 700 EPA employees had taken buyouts and early retirements by September, both because they oppose the agency’s current direction and to take advantage of a $12-million initiative launched to thin the ranks.</p>\n<p>When asked about the departures, an EPA spokeswoman said the agency has more than 1,600 scientists and that “Pruitt has assembled a staff of highly-qualified individuals to help implement the President’s agenda, and ensure that EPA will continue to promote policies that provide clean air and water, protecting the environment and human health, while encouraging economic growth.”</p>\n<p>Southerland’s former boss Kopocis, who retired in 2015, still speaks with former colleagues and tries to remind them why they came to the EPA in the first place.</p>\n<p>“People complain about the actions of the EPA, but when you ask about the specific benefits ... no one says, ‘I want that to go away,’” he said. “They don’t say ‘my drinking water is too safe’ or ‘the beaches are too clean. I really miss that hazardous waste site next to my kids’ school ...’</p>\n<p>“I’ve never been in a workplace where so many people work there because they wanted to,” Kopocis said. “They got graduate degrees so they would be qualified to work at the EPA ... It’s like being a park ranger — nobody would wear that Smokey the Bear hat unless they wanted to be a park ranger.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7767850.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/lauren-kirchner\">Lauren Kirchner</a> </p>\n<p>The algorithms that play increasingly central roles in our lives often emanate from Silicon Valley, but the effort to hold them accountable may have another epicenter: New York City. Last week, the New York City Council unanimously passed a bill to tackle algorithmic discrimination — the first measure of its kind in the country.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3137815&GUID=437A6A6D-62E1-47E2-9C42-461253F9C6D0\">algorithmic accountability bill</a>, waiting to be signed into law by Mayor Bill de Blasio, establishes a task force that will study how city agencies use algorithms to make decisions that affect New Yorkers’ lives, and whether any of the systems appear to discriminate against people based on age, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or citizenship status. The task force’s report will also explore how to make these decision-making processes understandable to the public.</p>\n<p>The bill’s sponsor, Council Member James Vacca, said he was inspired by ProPublica’s investigation into <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\">racially biased algorithms</a> used to assess the criminal risk of defendants.</p>\n<p>“My ambition here is transparency, as well as accountability,” Vacca said.</p>\n<p>A previous, more sweeping version of the bill had mandated that city agencies publish the source code of all algorithms being used for “targeting services” or “imposing penalties upon persons or policing” and to make them available for “self-testing” by the public. At a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-judge-unseals-new-york-crime-labs-software-for-analyzing-dna-evidence\">hearing</a> at City Hall in October, representatives from the mayor’s office expressed concerns that this mandate would threaten New Yorkers’ privacy and the government’s cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>The bill was one of two moves the City Council made last week concerning algorithms. On Thursday, the committees on health and public safety held a hearing on the city’s forensic methods, including controversial tools that the chief medical examiner’s office crime lab has used for difficult-to-analyze samples of DNA.</p>\n<p>As a ProPublica/New York Times investigation <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/thousands-of-criminal-cases-in-new-york-relied-on-disputed-dna-testing-techniques\">detailed</a> in September, an algorithm created by the lab for complex DNA samples has been called into question by scientific experts and former crime lab employees.</p>\n<p>The software, called the Forensic Statistical Tool, or FST, has never been adopted by any other lab in the country.</p>\n<p>Council Member Corey Johnson, chair of the health committee, quoted two key findings of our investigation: that FST’s inventors had acknowledged a margin of error of 30 percent for one key input of the program, and that the program could not take into consideration that family members might share DNA.</p>\n<p>New York City no longer uses the tool for new cases. But officials at the hearing said they saw no need to revisit the thousands of criminal cases that relied on the technique in years past.</p>\n<p>“Would you be open to reviewing cases in which testing was done on very small mixtures, or do you feel totally confident in all of the methods and science that were used on every case that’s come through your lab?” Johnson asked the officials.</p>\n<p>“We are totally confident,” answered Dr. Barbara Sampson, the city’s chief medical examiner.</p>\n<p>The algorithm’s source code was a closely held secret for years until a federal judge granted a motion filed by ProPublica to lift a protective order on it in October. We then <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-judge-unseals-new-york-crime-labs-software-for-analyzing-dna-evidence\">published the code</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171218-algo-accountable-impact-inline-new.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171218-algo-accountable-impact-inline-new.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171218-algo-accountable-impact-inline-new.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Officials from New York City’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner and the NYPD testify at an oversight hearing about the city’s forensic methods at City Hall on Dec. 14.\n<span>(Lauren Kirchner/ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Defense attorneys testified at the hearing, criticizing the medical examiner’s office for what they saw as a dangerous lack of transparency in the development of its DNA tools.</p>\n<p>Some had joined together to write to the state’s inspector general in September, demanding an investigation into the lab and a review of past cases. The inspector general, Catherine Leahy Scott, has not yet indicated whether she will pursue it. Meanwhile, the New York State Commission on Forensic Science, which oversees the use of forensic methods in the state’s labs, has discussed the criticisms in executive session meetings. Those sessions are closed to the public and commission members are prohibited from speaking about them.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Johnson said he was concerned by the discrepancies between the medical examiner’s testimony and that of advocates and intended to explore it further.</p>\n<p>“This is a very, very, very important issue, and we have to ensure that methods that are used are scientifically sound, validated in appropriate ways, transparent to the public and to defense counsels, and ensure greater trust in the justice system,” said Johnson. “And I think that is what, hopefully, we can achieve, through asking more questions — and potentially thinking about legislation in the future.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7767851.gif\" height=\"1\">",

That’s one reason why there was a sudden spike in new tax-related lobbying arrangements at the beginning of the Trump administration: With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress and the presidency, a tax bill was likely to come up, so companies wanted to influence it.</p>\n<p>Beyond taxation, <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/topics/\">each of 79 issues</a> has its own page.</p>\n<p><strong>Where the Data Comes From</strong></p>\n<p>The data, including issue categories like “taxation,” comes from a form that lobbying firms — or organizations that hire in-house lobbyists — are required to file, under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. The form is called an LD-1, and it is collected by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate. For more details, you can read the Clerk of the House’s <a href=\"https://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/amended_lda_guide.html\">guide to the lobbying disclosure rules</a>.</p>\n<p>Those two offices release these forms online as they receive them. We update the data daily, from big archives of XML files. The forms are published online individually, too. You can check our work by clicking the “Original Registration Form” link on each disclosure page to see the form presented visually, <a href=\"http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2017/RR/300919870.xml\">like this one</a>. We show almost all the fields from these forms, excluding firm/client addresses, related organizations and related foreign entities — we’ve organized it in a way that we think is easier to understand for researchers, activists and journalists.</p>\n<p>Lobbyists handing in the form also have to list the specific issues they plan to lobby on — that’s the “congressional investigation” tag that one of Facebook’s lobbyists cited. These can be as abstract as “tax reform” but can also get specific, like this disclosure from the Investment Program Association, which <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/300919870\">says it will be lobbying on</a> “Department of Labor definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA” and “H.R. 10, Financial CHOICE Act of 2017.” When lobbying registrations cite a specific bill, our app will link you to that bill.</p>\n<p>The forms also list the individual people doing the lobbying. If one of those lobbyists used to be a member of Congress, works as a congressional staffer, or has had one of a small set of positions in the executive branch in the last 20 years, the lobbyist is required to disclose that. The term of art for such lobbyists is “covered,” because they’re covered by a provision of the lobbying disclosure law.</p>\n<p>There’s another form that the law requires lobbyists to file: a form with updates each quarter, saying how much they spent, which federal agencies they lobbied and noting any changes to the issues or lobbyists involved. The updates also include the amount of money spent each month on lobbying efforts. The data from those quarterly updates isn’t included in our lobbyist search app ... yet.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways you might use the lobbyist database for research and journalism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Local companies</strong>: Big companies headquartered in spots across the country almost inevitably have hired lobbyists, whether they are car companies in Detroit or airlines in Atlanta. That may telegraph their future moves and concerns: trade agreements, maybe, or looming pension obligations.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Who</strong> <strong>your senators and representatives’ former staffers</strong> <strong>are now lobbying for</strong>: You’ll want to type in the name of the legislator. For instance, <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/search?search=burr\">searching “Burr”</a> will surface lobbying by former employees of North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. You may need to tweak what you search for if the member has a common name, like searching for “<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=%28Sen+OR+Richard%29+AND+Burr&commit=Search\">(Sen OR Richard) AND Burr</a>” to avoid finding lobbyists named Burr. If a member of Congress is particularly powerful on an issue on which large changes are proposed — like taxation — that lobbyist may attract clients based on their perceived influence on their former boss.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Locally resonant issues</strong>: Like dairy issues, for example. Think broadly. Dairy legislation affects school lunch requirements, import rules and whether almond milk gets to be called “milk” on the label.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Local government</strong>: City and county governments often lobby Congress for funding for projects like mass transit and libraries.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re researching an industry, here are some types of information you can find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Search for companies on your beat</strong>. Try searching for variations on their corporate names. So, if you cover Google, you’d want to search for Waymo and for Alphabet, too. Don’t forget about trade associations and coalitions, such as CropLife or the 21st Century Privacy Coalition. (We hope to soon include lists of “affiliated organizations” — like funders — of these sorts of groups.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Who companies hire to represent them in Washington</strong>: An organization that has hired a lobbyist with connections to a powerful legislator — maybe a committee chairman — may do this to try to affect measures the legislator will oversee or influence.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hot topics on your beat</strong>: If you <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=autonomous&commit=Search\">searched for “autonomous vehicles”</a> you might find — alongside companies like Uber and General Motors — organizations you didn’t expect to be lobbying, like <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/300901628\">San Mateo County, Calif.</a>, and the <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/300849467\">Contra Costa Transportation Authority</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Former regulators:</strong> High-ranking employees of executive branch agencies have to disclose their former positions, too. Searching for the names of agencies that regulate your area of interest may lead you to former employees.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Former lobbyists:</strong> A former in-house lobbyist for a pesticide industry group was appointed to lead a deregulatory team at the Department of Agriculture, a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-wide-open-door-for-pesticide-lobbyists-at-agriculture-department\">ProPublica article found</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>What <em>else</em> are companies on your beat lobbying on?</strong> Lots of companies lobby on issues that could seem outside their main area of focus. For instance, many newspaper companies lobby on pension issues.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here are some more details you’ll want to know:</p>\n<p>Whether lobbying firms have to file registrations is complicated. The registration is for the pairing of a lobbying firm (or a self-employed lobbyist) and a client. Lobbyists often represent multiple clients and clients sometimes have multiple sets of lobbyists at the same time. Lobbying firms may even contract out work on behalf of a client.</p>\n<p>A lobbyist is only required to register for their representation of a given client if all three of these conditions are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Their firm earns at least $3,000 for that client in a quarter — or, alternatively, if the lobbyist is employed by an organization to lobby on that organization’s behalf, if their company spends more than $13,000 on lobbying expenses in a quarter.</p></li>\n<li><p>The lobbyist has made two or more “lobbying contacts,” that is, attempts to influence government officials.</p></li>\n<li><p>At least 20 percent of the time the lobbyist spends working for that client — whether doing lobbying, analysis, strategy, legal work or anything else — is lobbying.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s possible some people or organizations that seem to be lobbying might not qualify. For instance, former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-trump.html\">has formed</a> a Washington, D.C., consulting firm, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/inside-the-lewandowski-embassy-244910\">has not registered as a lobbyist</a> because he maintains his activities don’t meet the legal description.</p>\n<p>Because our database does not include the end dates of lobbying relationships — and because the paperwork is rife with errors — you will, of course, want to verify if a lobbying relationship still exists by reporting it out.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in doing an analysis of a large number of these disclosures, you can <a href=\"http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldsearch.aspx\">download bulk data here</a>.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7736864.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/logan-jaffe\">Logan Jaffe</a> </p>\n<p><em>Molly Parker is a reporter at The Southern Illinoisan who’s been <a href=\"http://thesouthern.com/news/local/acha/\">covering</a> the housing and economic crisis in Cairo, in southern Illinois, for the past two-and-a-half years. She is one of seven reporters selected to join ProPublica’s <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/atpropublica/meet-the-seven-reporters-joining-us-on-propublicas-local-reporting-network\">Local Reporting Network</a>, a yearlong initiative that aims to boost local, investigative reporting by partnering with and paying the salaries of journalists in cities with populations below 1 million. This week, ProPublica Illinois engagement reporter Logan Jaffe interviewed Parker. Below is a lightly edited version of what Parker told Jaffe in their conversation.</em></p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171215-molly-parker-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171215-molly-parker-3x2.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171215-molly-parker-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>\n<span>Courtesy of Molly Parker</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I grew up in a town called Simpson. It’s a little bitty town in Johnson County. I think the sign says “Population: 60” but I’m pretty sure that’s an exaggeration. Our house was right outside the city limits, on a gravel road. I always tell people we had more cows than people. </p>\n<p>There were people in my classes growing up that I knew had some pretty harsh economic conditions right outside my doorstep. It didn’t strike me as something that was dramatic. People know their economic situation. People can also be very resilient and provide very happy upbringings for their children. But it’s always been troubling.</p>\n<p>After college, I left and was gone for 10 years. I worked at newspapers in North and South Carolina and Mississippi. They were closing my bureau in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I had a “Come to Jesus” moment and I thought, “I wonder if my local newspaper would have an opening?” [The Southern Illinoisan] brought me back here eventually. </p>\n<p>It took me a good year to reimagine reporting here and start to see what the issues were. I definitely saw it with different eyes than I did growing up. Over the last few years covering politics and elections and just getting out and talking to people, I feel that economic angst is increasing. </p>\n<p>We’ve had prison closures. The deep southern Illinois counties have continued to suffer from when I was a kid and continue to get worse. There’s never been anything to come in and replace the mineral extraction and fluorspar mining [industries]. They closed the Tamms Correctional Center. And now we’re seeing the evaporation of government and employment centers in southern Illinois. </p>\n<p>I came [back] here thinking it would be easier to report in a smaller area — but I have never been so busy in my life! I think that’s a product of a high-need area. There are lots of things people are anxious to have attention on. We have five reporters and we just can’t get to everything. All five of us will tell you we could work 24/7, 365 days, and never be out of stories or ideas. I mean, people have our cell phone numbers. </p>\n<p>We always try to remember that, despite all the needs, people want to celebrate their communities. There’s a lot of beauty. You can go out and report on something bad and difficult every day. But it’s not all gloom and doom here.</p>\n<p>The housing crisis is what brought us [to Cairo, Illinois]. While reporting there, people would stop me and ask, “Hey, would you do something on our violin program? It’s awesome!” And so we would make the time to do that. And I think that’s why we were able to establish relationships, or else we wouldn’t have been able to report the stories that we have.</p>\n<p>In Cairo, I was really touched by the people I met and the love they have for their community. And so I wanted to understand how [its housing crisis] happened at a local level, a state level and a federal level, and see how it all fit together. And I think once you know something, once you see something, you’re obligated to try to help address it.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7734413.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jason-grotto\">Jason Grotto</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Hal Dardick</span>, Chicago Tribune </p>\n<p>A group of public-interest lawyers filed a lawsuit Thursday alleging that embattled Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios violated state and federal civil rights and housing laws by knowingly producing inaccurate assessments that punished poor and minority homeowners across the county.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, contends the county’s “residential property tax scheme is neither accurate nor uniform” and is “perpetuating institutional racism” by shifting the tax burden from wealthier, majority-white neighborhoods to poorer, minority neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit also alleges a lack of transparency in the office, contending the “secrecy is antithetical to democratic accountability and undermines public trust and confidence in the residential property tax system.”</p>\n<p>Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that county assessments overvalue low-priced homes while undervaluing high-priced ones. Known as regressivity, that flaw leads to deep inequities in property taxes that break down along racial and ethnic lines, with poor, black and Hispanic homeowners paying more than they should while wealthier and white residents pay less.</p>\n<p>As a result, the lawsuit argues, the county violated the Illinois Civil Rights Act, equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and the federal Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read the Full Complaint</h3>\n<div></div>\n<p>\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4328741/2017-12-14-Complaint-and-Supporting-Documents.pdf\">2017 12 14 Complaint and Supporting Documents (PDF)</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4328741/2017-12-14-Complaint-and-Supporting-Documents.txt\">2017 12 14 Complaint and Supporting Documents (Text)</a>\n</div></p>\n</aside>\n<p>In response to the lawsuit, a spokesman for Berrios issued a blanket denial that anything is amiss with the office’s assessment system, but he declined to comment on the specific allegations in the complaint. The office has repeatedly denied that assessments are unfair or plagued with errors.</p>\n<p>“We again state that property assessment in Cook County is done correctly and fairly,” Tom Shaer, the spokesman, said in a written statement. “We do not comment on possible or pending litigation.”</p>\n<p>Drawing heavily from the Chicago Tribune’s series <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/\">“The Tax Divide”</a> as well as studies conducted by the lawyers, the Illinois Department of Revenue and a number of academics, the lawsuit alleges that Berrios “systematically and illegally shifts residential property tax burdens” across the county.</p>\n<p>The investigation has continued with an examination of commercial and industrial assessments, published last week in collaboration with ProPublica Illinois.</p>\n<p>Residential properties in Hispanic and black census tracts, for example, were twice as likely as those in white tracts to be over-assessed by 20 percent or more, according to the lawyers’ study — yet another in a long line of reports finding the assessment system to be error-ridden and deeply unfair.</p>\n<p>The assessor’s office has pushed back against critics, saying there is no bias in its assessments. Berrios has offered no evidence to back up the claim, however.</p>\n<p>Attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and the Logan Square Neighborhood Association, nonprofit organizations that help low-income, minority residents with housing matters.</p>\n<p>“It is fundamentally unfair that families in this community are required to pay artificially inflated taxes for their homes and bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden in Cook County,” said Patrick Brosnan, of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit asks the court to force the assessor’s office to adopt new residential valuation methods that produce fair and accurate results; to disclose all records, methods and computer code necessary to allow the public to replicate the assessor’s work; to appoint an independent monitor who would ensure the office follows the court’s orders; and to award monetary damages.</p>\n<p>Representing the plaintiffs are three Chicago law offices: Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, the public-interest firm where former President Barack Obama began his legal career; Hughes, Socol, Piers, Resnick &amp; Dym, a high-powered litigation firm that has taken on numerous pro bono cases; and the Chicago Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, founded in the aftermath of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and police misconduct during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“What we see in this case is the perpetuation of a system that disproportionately impacts communities of color and continues to strip capital from already struggling neighborhoods,” said Aneel Chablani, of the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. “It’s the same type of institutional racism that gave rise to Chicago’s extreme housing segregation through racial steering, discriminatory zoning and restrictive covenants.”</p>\n<p>Berrios has been under fire since the Tribune published “The Tax Divide” in June. Since then, the Cook County Board has summoned Berrios to testify about his office’s methods and practices, and Board President Toni Preckwinkle ordered an independent review of residential assessments. State and county lawmakers introduced legislation limiting the assessor’s ability to raise campaign funds, and the county’s independent inspector general launched an investigation of the office.</p>\n<p>All of the actions have increased pressure on the two-term assessor as he heads into a re-election campaign.</p>\n<p>Frank Shuftan, Preckwinkle’s chief spokesman, said she just learned the lawsuit had been filed and it would be reviewed by county attorneys.</p>\n<p>“There is an ongoing review of the residential property tax system led by Civic Consulting Alliance,” Shuftan added. “We have great faith in the good work of CCA and look forward to their findings.”</p>\n<p>Preckwinkle, who calls herself a Berrios friend and ally, announced that study in July, when commissioners called Berrios before the County Board to answer questions about the assessment system in the wake of publication of “The Tax Divide.”</p>\n<p>Three months later, commissioners again grilled Berrios, questioning whether he was trying to delay the completion of that study beyond the March Democratic primary. Berrios denied any attempt at delay, saying that he was cooperating with the review.</p>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/the-tax-divide/cook-county-commercial-and-industrial-property-tax-assessments/\">the joint ProPublica Illinois-Tribune investigation last week</a> that exposed similar flaws in commercial and industrial assessments, both Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Kennedy called on Berrios to resign. Three members of Congress, meanwhile, endorsed Fritz Kaegi, one of Berrios’ opponents.</p>\n<p>Berrios also is chair of the Cook County Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>Berrios’ campaign manager, Mario Lopez, responded to the lawsuit, dismissing it as “politically motivated.” Lopez contended that the lawsuit’s “main focus ... stems only from claims in articles” published by the Tribune.</p>\n<p>He called the “The Tax Divide” series — which found the residential assessment system under Berrios to be fundamentally flawed and unfair —\nmisleading and inaccurate.</p>\n<p>While the lawsuit does mention the Tribune’s findings, it also cited Illinois Department of Revenue statistics and conclusions drawn by the University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Chicago to support its allegations.</p>\n<p>In addition to describing inequities in the Cook County system, the lawsuit focuses on details revealed in “The Tax Divide” that show Berrios’ office failed to deliver on promised reforms.</p>\n<p>In July 2015, the assessor’s office issued a news release stating that it had “implemented a new state-of-the-art” residential assessment model that improved accuracy by 50 percent and cut regressivity by 25 percent.</p>\n<p>Yet a Tribune analysis of residential assessments suggested the office never implemented the new model. Confronted by reporters, officials first said the office had used both the old and the new models, though they refused to explain how. When reporters pointed out numerous errors the office made when running the new model, officials changed their story. Instead, they said they had used the old one as a baseline — while again refusing to discuss their methods.</p>\n<p>As pressure mounted, the assessor’s office began attacking the new model as widely inaccurate and accused the experts who built it of being dishonest, despite internal studies showing the new model outperformed the old one.</p>\n<p>The 2015 news release is now part of the lawsuit, which argues that Berrios knew residential assessments were unfair, misled the public and failed to make improvements.</p>\n<p>The office’s “evasions and deceptions undermine public trust and confidence in the residential property tax system and do not comport with democratic principles, which require that government officials be accountable to the public,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n<p>The lawyers relied on their own analysis as well as studies by the Tribune, the University of Chicago, the Illinois Department of Revenue and others to support their assertion that residential assessments are error-ridden and unfair.</p>\n<p>In the predominantly black and Hispanic working-class neighborhoods of North Lawndale and Little Village, for instance, effective tax rates were twice as high as in the affluent and mostly white Gold Coast and Lincoln Park neighborhoods, the plaintiffs’ study found.</p>\n<p>In a fair system, the effective tax rate would be nearly identical for all neighborhoods in a taxing district.</p>\n<p>The study also found that as the percentage of white residents in a census tract increased, the ratio between the assessor’s values and actual sale prices decreased — yet more evidence that the county’s residential assessment system is biased against minorities.</p>\n<p>The pattern fits a decades-long history of housing discrimination, redlining and other ills that have punished minorities and fueled segregation in Cook County, the lawsuit alleges.</p>\n<p>“Today, (the office’s) practices are injecting new injuries on these same communities — by taxing their disadvantage, stripping capital out of their neighborhoods again, and perpetuating institutional racism.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7726358.gif\" height=\"1\">",

Cohen</a>, ProPublica </p>\n<p>A secretive appeals system has been knocking down the punishments of Chicago police officers no matter how serious their misconduct, undercutting the results of lengthy investigations and layers of review long after the public believes the cases were concluded.</p>\n<p>In the first examination of its kind, the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica Illinois found that 85 percent of disciplinary cases handled through the Chicago Police Department’s grievance process since 2010 led to officers receiving shorter suspensions or, in many cases, having their punishments overturned entirely.</p>\n<p>A suspension for punching a handcuffed arrestee, all caught on camera? Negotiable.</p>\n<p>Discipline for making racially insensitive comments during a traffic stop? Tossed out and expunged from the record.</p>\n<p>Punishments for making false statements, an offense for which the department says it has zero tolerance? Those, too, were wiped away as if they never happened.</p>\n<p>The result: the weakening of a police accountability system that rarely finds fault with officers’ actions in the first place.</p>\n<p>By the time an officer’s misconduct appeal reaches the Police Department’s Management and Labor Affairs Section, where grievances are handled, the officer has already been found at fault in an internal affairs investigation or after an inquiry by the city’s police watchdog agency, whose findings are public. In some cases, the discipline already has been upheld by the Chicago Police Board, whose decisions also are public.</p>\n<p>But the department’s labor office operates behind closed doors and according to requirements contained in the police union contract. Victims and complainants were not told when an officer filed a grievance nor were they notified of its outcome.</p>\n<p>The decisions that overturn discipline can have little to do with the facts behind the actual misconduct. The system’s notorious inefficiencies end up working in an officer’s favor, with punishments being dismissed because investigations took too long, the Tribune-ProPublica Illinois investigation found.</p>\n<p>The Police Department has no system to track cases, so reporters used data and records from the department and its oversight agency to follow more than 300 disciplinary cases, analyzing changes between the original discipline orders and the actual outcomes.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Chicago Police Grievances</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"CPD Grievances\" title=\"CPD Grievances\" src=\"https://www.propublica.org/cpresources/transforms/14850?x=HcIf79lrD\"></p>\n<p>A Chicago Tribune-ProPublica Illinois investigation tracked more than 300 police disciplinary cases appealed through the department’s labor office, the Management and Labor Affairs Section. We analyzed changes between original discipline orders and what officers actually served. </p>\n<p>In 85 percent of cases, appeals led to officers receiving reduced punishment or seeing their punishment overturned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/il-grievances\"><strong>Explore the Data</strong></a></p>\n</aside>\n<p>The department provided a data set of grievances in response to open records requests, including information that showed which cases were expunged. Reporters then used investigative reports, arbitrator opinions, settlement agreements and other records to examine the cases.</p>\n<p>Some of the documents were provided after the Tribune filed a lawsuit a year ago against the Police Department.</p>\n<p>The investigation found that, of 314 disciplinary appeals the police union pursued on behalf of officers between February 2010 and February 2017, 266 led to favorable outcomes for officers. Police had their punishments reduced or — in 58 of those cases — had them overturned entirely.</p>\n<p>About half of the 314 total grievances were decided by an independent arbitrator selected by the union and the city. In the others, union officials and city lawyers negotiated settlement agreements before arbitration began, typically for officers to receive a reduced punishment in exchange for withdrawing their grievances.</p>\n<p>Sharon Fairley, the former chief administrator of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), which investigates officer misconduct, said the frequency with which officers win grievances raises questions about the disciplinary system.</p>\n<p>“We should understand why this is happening and try to make sure that the process as it works has some integrity,” she said.</p>\n<p>Nearly all the grievances involved suspensions, and the total number of days officers were suspended was collectively cut by half. Officers can appeal punishments up to a yearlong suspension, but appeals of firings are decided by the police board, not through the grievance system.</p>\n<p>The department suspends an average of 192 officers a year, from a police force of 12,000 sworn officers. Depending on the year, between 13 percent and 47 percent challenged the punishment, the investigation found.</p>\n<p>Police successfully appealed discipline for all kinds of misconduct: neglect of duty, insubordination, drunken driving, domestic violence and excessive force.</p>\n<p>Officers were more likely to get their punishment overturned completely when the case went to an arbitrator, while they were more likely to see a reduction in discipline — or some of the findings tossed out — through a settlement.</p>\n<p>There is little to risk by seeking the review, and, in fact, 14 officers appealed multiple cases during the period analyzed by reporters. One officer filed four grievances and won three.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t hurt to grieve it. Why wouldn’t I?” said Officer Jeffrey Kriv, who records show has successfully challenged at least two suspensions during his 21 years on the force.</p>\n<p>Kevin Graham, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents rank-and-file Chicago officers and that is in negotiations with the city over a new contract, said appeals are necessary because oversight investigators and the department sometimes overreach.</p>\n<p>“We are only looking to be treated fairly,” Graham said. “I do think that the arbitration system and independent arbitrators are a useful part of getting to the truth and to getting to fair discipline.”</p>\n<p>In a written statement, police spokesman Frank Giancamilli said the initial punishments served on officers are “carefully considered” to reflect the seriousness and nature of a case. They remain the department’s official stance, he said, even if they are later overturned or settled.</p>\n<p>Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the city’s Law Department, said city attorneys weigh each case individually, and that decisions to settle cases before arbitration are driven by the likelihood of winning, more than the nature of the misconduct. He said the city “is disappointed in any loss in the arbitration process” and sometimes agrees to settle — including in cases where police were found to have given false statements — when a careful analysis suggests the city might lose at arbitration and establish an unwanted precedent.</p>\n<p>“The Law Department,” McCaffrey said, “considers each case individually, and recognizes that some measure of discipline is often more important than letting an alleged infraction go unpunished.”</p>\n<p>But at a time when the city has promised greater police accountability, its grievance system potentially undermines that, especially since the punishments often have been agreed on by multiple police officials, said Mark Iris, a Northwestern University political science professor and former executive director of the police board.</p>\n<p>“The weaker cases, at this point, already have been filtered out. … These should be, in large part, slam dunks” for the department, said Iris, who studies police discipline. “The fact that officers’ discipline is frequently reduced, especially in serious cases, is very compelling. It basically undercuts the disciplinary process big time.”</p>\n<h3>Zero Tolerance</h3>\n<p>By settling cases, the city avoids the cost of arbitration — and the chance it will lose entirely — and usually ensures the officer receives at least some punishment.</p>\n<p>During the past seven years, the department has settled 151 cases, the Tribune-ProPublica Illinois analysis shows. More than 75 percent of suspensions from those cases were cut by half or more through negotiations.</p>\n<p>In addition, some of the settlements include an agreement to drop one of the most serious findings against an officer: a violation of police Rule 14, making a false oral or written statement. Department officials have said they have zero tolerance for officers who aren’t truthful, and that those who violate the rule will be fired.</p>\n<p>But the Tribune-ProPublica Illinois investigation found that, since 2010, the city has negotiated settlements with at least 19 officers that included expunging from their records findings that they had given false statements during an investigation. About half of the violations were tied to excessive force cases or issues during arrests.</p>\n<p>The discipline recommendations in these Rule 14 cases were all made prior to the current police administration, and the department said that it now moves to fire officers who violate Rule 14, so they are not able to file a grievance to dispute it.</p>\n<p>A violation of police Rule 14 is problematic not only for the officer, but also for the department and the city. Lawyers have ammunition to challenge an officer’s credibility in court, and the officer might be viewed as dishonest in other aspects of the job, making it difficult to keep him on the street.</p>\n<p>The department considers it so serious that before investigators interview officers they warn them that “failure to provide a complete and accurate statement” could result in “disciplinary action up to and including separation.”</p>\n<p>When the city settles grievances with officers, including those that result in Rule 14 violations being dropped, the agreements provide no explanation for why a punishment is reduced or a charge eliminated. Fairley, the former COPA chief administrator, said the city and department “have to be careful” when they decide which cases to settle.</p>\n<p>“Our view is that a Rule 14 should never be settled,” Fairley said in an interview before she left COPA in October to run for Illinois attorney general.</p>\n<p>The department said it settled Rule 14 cases that it felt might not hold up if taken to arbitration, including because some cases were old or witnesses were no longer available. It said it also tries to gauge its odds of success by looking at whether similar cases were overturned in arbitration.</p>\n<p>But the settling of 19 cases is even more significant in context; few officers were found to have violated Rule 14 in the first place.</p>\n<p>“Enforcement in this area is rarely taken seriously and is largely ignored,” a U.S. Department of Justice investigation released early this year found.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department investigation found 98 Rule 14 violations were sustained during the past five years, and questioned whether the number was low because officers were rarely held accountable for being untruthful.</p>\n<p>As part of the settlements, the city agreed to keep the public from knowing about the Rule 14 violations. The department redacted the officer’s name, case number and all references to the Rule 14 finding from the settlement agreements, explaining to reporters requesting the information under the Freedom of Information Act that it had been stricken because an expungement is like it “never existed.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Officer Vincent Torres’ disciplinary record won’t show that police officials years ago concluded he provided a false statement about his conduct to the Independent Police Review Authority, COPA’s predecessor.</p>\n<p>Torres and his partner had stopped some teens in 2009 because they suspected the teens had just defaced a garage with graffiti and were driving the wrong way down a one-way street.</p>\n<p>Witness Ed Zotti said he heard a commotion while working in his Lakeview home and looked out to see Torres kick the teen in the head while he was lying facedown in the street. The kick was so strong, Zotti said, that the teen’s head snapped back.</p>\n<p>Disturbed by what he saw, Zotti, editor of the Straight Dope column in the Chicago Reader, wrote a letter to then-Superintendent Jody Weis saying, “I hope you will make clear to your officers that this kind of thing will not be tolerated.” He was interviewed by IPRA.</p>\n<p>The last he heard, several years ago, his complaint had been upheld.</p>\n<p>It was, not only by IPRA but also on appeal to the police board.</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div><video data-account=\"3690581440001\" data-player=\"S1vBkbMfe\" controls data-embed=\"default\" data-video-id=\"ref:95426869\"></video>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>Ed Zotti, of Chicago, told police officials he saw an officer kick a handcuffed teen in the head. The officer was originally given a 30-day suspension but it was reduced to 15 days and the finding that he made a false statement was expunged after he grieved the punishment and the city settled the case.\n<span>(Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>IPRA and the police board found Torres violated Rule 14 when he said he hadn’t kicked the teenager because both the teen and Zotti — who never spoke with each other — gave consistent accounts of what happened.</p>\n<p>Torres was given a 30-day suspension for kicking a handcuffed teenager and denying it to investigators.</p>\n<p>He filed a grievance in 2014. The case was headed to arbitration earlier this year when the city agreed to cut the suspension in half and drop the Rule 14 violation, and Torres agreed to drop his grievance, according to records from the department and IPRA. Torres could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Settlements are subject to open records requests but otherwise are not posted or shared with the public. Victims are not informed of the agreements.</p>\n<p>Zotti, 66, said in a recent interview that he couldn’t understand how the city could drop the Rule 14 charge but uphold the excessive force.</p>\n<p>“Either he did it or didn’t do it,” Zotti said. “It is not like he half did it.”</p>\n<h3>Wins and Losses</h3>\n<p>Cases that the city and union don’t agree to settle go to an arbitrator, whose decisions are binding and become the final word. Of the 147 suspension cases over the past seven years decided by an arbitrator, officers won 112, or about 76 percent of the time, records show.</p>\n<p>Officer Matthew O’Brien faced a misconduct investigation after he stopped a car of five young black men, most of them out-of-town college students here for the Taste of Chicago during the July Fourth weekend in 2009.</p>\n<p>He handcuffed the men together, wrist to wrist, searched their car, mocked their objections that they had done nothing wrong and made what investigative records called “racial comments.” Records show that O’Brien allegedly told them: “Johnnie Cochran is dead and Barack Obama can’t save you.”</p>\n<p>Police wrote tickets for tinted windows and not having a city sticker, then let them go.</p>\n<p>The men, two of whom had studied criminal justice in college, were so upset about how O’Brien treated them that they immediately lodged a complaint with IPRA and filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, which the city later settled for $9,500.</p>\n<p>Jontavious Pruitt, who was 26 and from Tallahassee, Fla., remembers feeling humiliated as O’Brien searched the trunk of the car, took bottles of unopened liquor from a bag and smashed them on the ground.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if it was for laughs and giggles or jokes. I do know that's not the way a police officer, someone who is supposed to be protecting us, should treat us,” said Pruitt, an information technology manager for the Atlanta Aviation Department.</p>\n<p>O’Brien, IPRA determined, deserved a 10-day suspension for verbal abuse and a search of the car without justification, though the police superintendent disagreed.</p>\n<p>O’Brien took the case to the police board. He argued that he was alone in an unsafe neighborhood on the city’s South Side and acted because the car’s windows were tinted. He denied making any racially charged comments.</p>\n<p>The board upheld the suspension in October 2014 in a unanimous 6-0 ruling that concluded O’Brien’s “demeaning and unprofessional comments and his unauthorized search of the trunk are serious offenses.”</p>\n<p>O’Brien filed a grievance that December. The case was heard by George Roumell, who has ruled on more Chicago police grievances than any of the other nine arbitrators who have decided cases since 2010.</p>\n<p>Roumell sided with O’Brien. In a 15-page opinion issued last year, he said that taking five years to complete the investigation and serve the officer with a suspension “violated all concepts of fairness and all concepts of correction.”</p>\n<p>With those words, the suspension was thrown out. O’Brien was promoted to sergeant this year.</p>\n<p>Roumell and other arbitrators regularly overturned punishments because of the length of time it took to investigate the misconduct — a persistent problem for the Police Department and the city’s police oversight agencies.</p>\n<p>The IPRA investigator who examined O’Brien’s case interviewed witnesses and the officer within a year but didn’t issue her report until two years after that, Roumell wrote. He mentioned another case in which he threw out an officer’s 45-day suspension on similar grounds.</p>\n<p>“It’s like a slap in our face now,” said Xavier Hopkins, the driver of the car, now a call center manager and musician in Milwaukee. “Even if you try to do the right thing, you try to do it the right way by filing a complaint, there’s still no accountability.”</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<div><video data-account=\"3690581440001\" data-player=\"S1vBkbMfe\" controls data-embed=\"default\" data-video-id=\"ref:95437851\"></video>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>Xavier Hopkins was driving a car full of friends when they were stopped by a Chicago police officer, handcuffed together and later let go. The men filed a complaint.\n<span>(Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Another one of the men, Donya Jackson, then 23, said his desire to become a Chicago police officer ended that night. He now lives in Washington, D.C., and works in law enforcement for a federal agency.</p>\n<p>“It was about the principle. About not allowing him to get away with it,” Jackson said. “But clearly, he got away with it.”</p>\n<p>Roumell, who at 89 has been arbitrating cases for decades, declined to comment. A lawyer in Detroit and a former president of the State Bar of Michigan, he has ruled on at least 75 cases since 2010, siding with the officer 79 percent of the time. In 17 cases, he erased the punishment completely.</p>\n<h3>A ‘House of Cards’</h3>\n<p>While the grievance process is opaque, arbitrators’ written rulings offer some insight into the process and show that their rulings often are about more than officers’ conduct.</p>\n<p>In labor arbitrations, the Police Department and other government employers must prove there was “just cause” to discipline the officer. The department has to show the officer was afforded due process during disciplinary proceedings, that the evidence proved the misconduct and that the punishment was warranted.</p>\n<p>Arbitrator Daniel Nielsen, who has sided with officers in 22 of 26 cases he has decided since 2010, said officers succeed so often because the union backs only the strongest grievances. And, in fact, the union filed an additional 100 grievances since 2010 only to later withdraw them, the Tribune-ProPublica Illinois analysis found.</p>\n<p>The losing party pays the arbitrator’s fees.</p>\n<p>“You have to be very careful when you are looking at win-loss percentages because these cases aren’t randomly selected,” Nielsen said. “They are carefully screened. Nobody is going to pay thousands of dollars to take a dead loser in front of an arbitrator. It just doesn’t make any sense.”</p>\n<p>The union, for instance, took the case of an officer suspended five days for a minor paperwork blunder. The officer had written a parking ticket to an off-duty police sergeant but missed an additional paperwork step and the sergeant filed a complaint against him.</p>\n<p>The union argued that the penalty was “very heavy-handed.” Arbitrator Jacalyn Zimmerman agreed and threw out the suspension. “To discipline this officer in this manner for a technical violation is, quite simply, unconscionable,” Zimmerman wrote in her decision last year.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171214-chicago-police-grievances-perkovich-1a-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171214-chicago-police-grievances-perkovich-1a-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171214-chicago-police-grievances-perkovich-1a-3x2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171214-chicago-police-grievances-perkovich-1a-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Robert Perkovich, a DePaul University professor, has served as an arbitrator in Chicago police cases for the past two decades. He has decided nine cases in recent years, ruling in favor of the officer in four of them.\n<span>(Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>An arbitrator’s decision can be subjective, said Robert Perkovich, a DePaul University business professor who for 20 years has served as an arbitrator in Chicago police cases.</p>\n<p>“The arbitrator is ultimately deciding what he or she believes is the just result,” Perkovich said. “It is a lot like beauty. It lies in the eye of the beholder.”</p>\n<p>He likened a disciplinary case to a “house of cards” that can fall apart anytime depending on the evidence, even when the misconduct is not in dispute.</p>\n<p>When Officer Hugo Thurmond’s grievance came before arbitrator Zimmerman, the facts were set: Thurmond had shot a man while off-duty and then fled without securing the scene or witnesses or even reporting it. So Zimmerman was deciding whether Thurmond’s failure to follow protocol warranted his 10-day suspension.</p>\n<p>Thurmond and a woman he told investigators he had offered a ride to were parked in the Garfield Park neighborhood at 5:30 a.m. in June 2009, when a man tried to force the pair out of the car. Thurmond shot the man and drove off, leaving the man wounded and letting the woman out a few blocks away without getting her name or a statement.</p>\n<p>The man crawled through a vacant lot and an alley, looking for help. A homeowner saw him and called 911. Thurmond waited a half-hour to report the shooting.</p>\n<p>The Police Department argued before Zimmerman that Thurmond “should have been well aware of the importance of preserving the crime scene and rendering aid.”</p>\n<p>The union argued he made a reasonable decision to flee because he was “in fear for his life.”</p>\n<p>Zimmerman agreed with the union. In her decision, she cited the chaotic nature of the situation in concluding that Thurmond did not deserve a suspension.</p>\n<p>Securing the crime scene “would, of course, have been optimum,” she ruled, “but it was not worth the grievant’s life.”</p>\n<p>Zimmerman, a former chair of the Illinois Labor Relations Board who is married to arbitrator Nielsen, declined to comment. Thurmond could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The written decisions also offer a window into why arbitrators would rule in favor of an officer even when there’s clear evidence of wrongdoing. They may find that the misconduct warranted punishment but the discipline process was unfair.</p>\n<p>That’s how Officer Jeffrey Kriv got a lesser punishment than he otherwise would have.</p>\n<p>Kriv was charged with misconduct for a 2008 incident caught on video in which he reached into the rear of his squad car and punched a man detained on suspicion of drunken driving. The man had spit on him.</p>\n<p>Kriv said he punched the man in self-defense after the man tried to kick him. But an IPRA investigator concluded that the video did not show that. Kriv, the investigator said, could have instead shut the door and asked for help.</p>\n<p>IPRA recommended a five-day suspension in 2014, nearly six years after the incident, and Kriv filed a grievance.</p>\n<p>The police superintendent agreed with IPRA that Kriv should be suspended, telling the arbitrator that Kriv “could simply have closed the door.” The union argued that Kriv used “reasonable force” to defend himself. It also pointed out that the man, who pleaded guilty to drunken driving, declined to cooperate with the IPRA investigation.</p>\n<p>Zimmerman agreed that Kriv was guilty of mistreating the detainee. But she decided five days was “excessive,” citing how much time had passed between the incident and when the officer was served with the penalty.</p>\n<p>“At this point, any corrective purpose has long expired,” she wrote in the January 2016 opinion. “This sort of conduct is still, however, sufficiently serious to warrant time off.”</p>\n<p>She gave him two days without pay. It wasn’t Kriv’s only discipline, or his only successful grievance. In 2004, in a settlement agreement, he had a different five-day suspension reduced to a reprimand, records show.</p>\n<p>“I was pissed I got suspended at all, to be honest with you,” Kriv said in an interview. “He starts spitting on me. It is disgusting. … What are my options? I am not going to duck and weave. I went in the back and clocked him. You are damn right I did. It got him to stop.</p>\n<p>“He could have spat all night. What am I supposed to do, wait until he runs out of spit?”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7722707.gif\" height=\"1\">",

This year, ProPublica and NPR have been investigating this question through our Lost Mothers series. We’ve explored myriad factors that contribute to the 700 to 900 American women who die each year from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes, as well as the more than 50,000 women annually who suffer life-threatening complications.</p>\n<p>As we have continued to dig into this problem, we have focused on the personal stories of affected women and their families. Thousands of people have shared their experiences with us since <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-and-npr-investigate-maternal-mortality\">our initial callout in February</a>, and those stories hold critical lessons for hospitals, regulators and policymakers. Making such experiences visible and transparent — lifting them up not only as individual tragedies, but as part of a public health crisis that endangers <em>all</em> women — remains a vital aspect of this project.</p>\n<p>In addition to this tremendous response from families who have lost someone, or narrowly escaped tragedy, we have received numerous emails from people who want to push the conversation further.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo400w/20171213-lost-mothers-toolkit.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo800w/20171213-lost-mothers-toolkit.png 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo1600w/20171213-lost-mothers-toolkit.png 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo400w/20171213-lost-mothers-toolkit.png\">\n<figcaption>Your step-by-step guide to sparking community and change on maternal health.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We’ve heard from expectant mothers seeking more specific advice on finding the best possible provider and preparing for an emergency.</p>\n<p>We’ve been contacted by advocates calling for a closer examination of where the health care system is failing women, including the areas of insurance companies and the responsibility of care providers.</p>\n<p>We continue to hear from professionals, who are eager to highlight the vital roles of midwives, mental health care services and other providers. Essentially, our readers are looking to engage with this material beyond our stories, and yearning to exchange more of their ideas.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’ve created the <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/pdf/LOST-MOTHERS-EVENT-GUIDE.pdf\">Lost Mothers Event Toolkit</a>, a step-by-step guide designed to foster local conversation and connection around the U.S. maternal mortality crisis. Exploring these issues in your own community is a powerful tool to raise awareness, create opportunities to exchange perspectives and spark ideas for change.</p>\n<p>We encourage interested organizations, health institutions and individuals to host discussions on the most important issues around maternal health in their communities.

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/topher-sanders\">Topher Sanders</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Benjamin Conarck</span>, Florida Times-Union </p>\n<p>More than half the 2,000 people who received pedestrian tickets in Duval County, Florida, from 2012 to 2016 saw their driver’s licenses suspended or their ability to obtain one limited, according to an analysis by the Florida Times-Union and ProPublica.</p>\n<p>The tickets, which carry what can seem like a modest $65 fine, can have more significant consequences for those who get them and refuse to pay or are unable to do so.</p>\n<p>Over five years, a total of 2,004 pedestrian tickets were issued in Duval County, which is comprised almost entirely by the city of Jacksonville. Of those tickets, 982 people who failed or were unable to pay the fine lost their driver’s licenses or their ability to obtain one, according to the analysis.</p>\n<p>The license suspensions help answer a question at the center of a Times-Union/ProPublica investigation of pedestrian tickets in Jacksonville: What are the consequences for individuals swept up in the Jacksonville Sheriff Office’s aggressive enforcement of some two dozen often obscure pedestrian statutes?</p>\n<p>Last month, the Times-Union/ProPublica investigation showed that 55 percent of the tickets given in recent years went to blacks despite the fact that they make up only 29 percent of the city’s population. Blacks were similarly overrepresented in the 932 tickets that led to license suspensions — 54 percent.</p>\n<p>As of Tuesday’s City Council meeting, three elected officials on the body have called on Sheriff Mike Williams to order his officers to stop writing pedestrian tickets. Council member Garrett Dennis asked the Office of General Counsel to review what authority the council had to compel him to do so. In addition to voicing her support for that measure, council member Katrina Brown asked for a noticed meeting focused on pedestrian infrastructure and enforcement.</p>\n<p>The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office has insisted that blacks have not been targeted in the issuance of pedestrian tickets, and said it saw no reason to review the investigation’s findings of a disproportionate impact on African Americans. The office said those receiving tickets could contest them before a judge, and that it would address any erroneous or improper ticketing with additional training of officers.</p>\n<p>Losing one’s license in a sprawling city like Jacksonville can make aspects of daily life seem near impossible, whether you’re a mother shuttling children to school or a trucker trying to secure your next job.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171213-eboni-dekine-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171213-eboni-dekine-inline.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171213-eboni-dekine-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Eboni Dekine stands by where she received a jaywalking ticket near the intersection of Ricker Road and 103rd Street on Jacksonville’s Westside. ProPublica and the Times-Union determined the ticket was given in error, but Dekine’s driver’s license was suspended after she didn’t pay the fine.\n<span>(Dede Smith/Florida Times-Union)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Florida state Sen. Jeff Brandes, a Republican from Pinellas County who sits on the legislature’s criminal justice committee, has repeatedly introduced measures that would prohibit driver’s license suspensions for non-driving offenses.</p>\n<p>In an interview Monday, Brandes said that a driver’s license suspension is often a Floridian’s first experience with the criminal justice system. Then, he added, it can “snowball” from there.</p>\n<p>“You don’t pay the fine, or you can’t pay the fine, but you still have got to get to work — then you’re facing a Catch-22,” Brandes said. “Do I drive and not make it to work and get fired, or do I not drive and get fired? We just think that, unless it’s a driving-relating incident, you shouldn’t have to make that choice.”</p>\n<p>The state senator’s bill, which he plans to submit for the third time, would allow for those who demonstrate financial hardship to perform community service if they are unable to pay civil fines. He said the bill has never made it to a full vote by the legislature. Clerks of court in Florida stand to lose about $40 million annually if the law governing driver’s license suspensions is modified.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the clerks of courts have been funded based on transaction volume, and one of their highest-margin transactions is driver’s licenses,” Brandes said.</p>\n<p>The Times-Union and ProPublica identified the 932 suspensions by using data from the Duval County Clerk of Courts and the Florida Court Clerks and Comptrollers.</p>\n<p>The tally is surely conservative. For instance, it does not include people who had their licenses suspended, but then reinstated after eventually paying the fine.</p>\n<p>“Who would have thought that someone who gets a walking infraction is going to be barred from getting a driver’s license?” said Samuel Brooke, deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Economic Justice Program. “I think it shows the absurdity of linking the ability to drive to the ability to fulfill a financial obligation in the criminal justice system.”</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<div>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/walking-while-black-tickets-officer-brown\">\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171117-walking-while-black-tickets-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171117-walking-while-black-tickets-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171117-walking-while-black-tickets-3x2.jpg 1200w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171117-walking-while-black-tickets-3x2.jpg\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/walking-while-black-tickets-officer-brown\">One Officer, Scores of Tickets and a Familiar Racial Disparity</a></h3>\n<h4>C.J.

This is you won’t be able to drive, you won’t be able to drive until you come up with a way to pay off this fine, and that’s just frankly unconscionable.”</p>\n<p>State Rep. Tracie Davis, a Jacksonville Democrat, said that she, too, would be looking into ways to change the laws governing pedestrian citations and driver’s license suspensions.</p>\n<p>“This type of ticket that goes unpaid creates extreme negative situations for an African-American household already probably struggling,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>Davis added that people might not grasp the seriousness of the ticket, which then gets left unpaid, and leads to the suspensions.</p>\n<p>“It’s just extreme,” Davis said, “and it has extreme after-effects for people of color.”</p>\n<p>What’s more, 132 of the tickets, issued for crossing outside of a crosswalk, led to license suspensions, but didn’t conform with state law and should never have been issued, according to the analysis. The infraction applies only when people cross in between intersections with traffic lights, but was routinely cited without regard for traffic light placement.</p>\n<p>The sheriff’s office has previously said it has asked the local state attorney to give it guidance on the proper application of the crosswalk statute.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7714397.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ian-macdougall\">Ian MacDougall</a> </p>\n<p>President Donald Trump’s choice to head a federal coal mine regulator, like more than one of his nominees, is a vocal critic of the very agency he’s being asked to lead. Steven Gardner is a longtime coal industry consultant, and he has <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article133461074.html\">called</a> the agency’s marquee Obama-era regulation the product of “one of the most disingenuous and dishonest efforts put forward by a government agency.”</p>\n<p>But in Gardner’s case, there is an unusual — and contentious — twist: He runs an engineering firm that produced a report as part of the process of preparing that regulation, and the agency deemed it so shoddy that it cut ties with Gardner’s company. Now he’s the nominee to head that agency, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. (In broad terms, OSMRE — pronounced “oz-muhr” — focuses on mining’s effect on the environment, while the other key regulator, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, focuses on the welfare of miners.)</p>\n<p>State and federal officials at the time harshly criticized a draft report produced jointly by Gardner’s firm, ESCI, and other contractors. They blasted it as “nonsensical,” “junk,” “inaccurate and incomplete,” and “a piece of crap.” Some OSMRE staff members went so far as to accuse Gardner of trying to sabotage the regulation his firm was hired to help develop.</p>\n<p>Acrimony and accusations flowed in both directions. Gardner charged that agency officials had pressured contractors to soften the projected economic impact of the regulation, the Stream Protection Rule. The stated purpose of the rule was to limit damage done by coal mining to waterways, but Gardner and other critics saw it as a strike at the heart of the coal industry.</p>\n<p>Gardner is expected to testify in the coming weeks at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Former Obama administration officials and a contractor who worked with Gardner have questioned how he will lead an agency that he has held — and that has held him — in something less than high regard.</p>\n<p>“It has been said that one of my biggest challenges will be winning the support of OSM staff I will oversee due to the past controversies,” Gardner said in an emailed statement. “While there may be some in OSM that differed with my opinions, many others sent me messages of support noting they did not agree with OSM management during that controversial period.” (The White House referred a request for comment to the Department of the Interior, OSMRE’s parent agency, which did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>This was no backroom tiff. The conflict between Gardner and OSMRE played out in unusually public forums, including congressional hearings. On Capitol Hill, Republican opponents of the Obama administration’s ambitious environmental and energy agendas had branded its coal policy a “war on coal.” They seized on Gardner’s claims as evidence that the administration was fighting dirty.</p>\n<p>Gardner’s strained relationship with the agency can be traced to 2010. ECSI was among a group of contractors hired to analyze the environmental and economic impact of various proposals for the Stream Protection Rule. OSMRE officials hoped ECSI and another subcontractor, Morgan Worldwide, would serve as counterweights to each other. ECSI worked principally with the coal industry, while Morgan Worldwide tended to represent environmental interests.</p>\n<p>By the fall of that year, state and federal officials had begun to express doubts about whether the contractors were up to the task. “If this had come from one of my entry-level students (when I taught college hydro), I would have failed them,” OSMRE scientist Debbie Dale wrote in an email that November, describing a section of the draft report assigned to ECSI. She called it the “most poorly written ‘professional’ document” she had ever seen, according to the 2013 inspector general report. Eight state regulators wrote a letter to OSMRE Director Joseph Pizarchik, calling it “often nonsensical and difficult to follow.”</p>\n<p>At one 2011 meeting, Dianne Shawley, a senior agency attorney, laid the bulk of the blame at the feet of ECSI and the other subcontractors. “They’ve given you a piece of crap, really. To be blunt,” she told executives from the general contractor, Polu Kai Services.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171212-coal-nominee-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171212-coal-nominee-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171212-coal-nominee-3x2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171212-coal-nominee-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Former Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement director Joe Pizarchik speaks during a Natural Resources Committee hearing titled “Jobs at Risk: Waste and Mismanagement by the Obama Administration in Rewriting the Stream Buffer Zone Rule,” in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Nov. 4, 2011. <span>(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Agency officials were dismayed. “In my experience, it was very unusual to receive so much negative feedback about a contractor’s work,” said Pizarchik, who stepped down at the end of the Obama administration, in an interview with ProPublica. “I’m not aware of other instances where this has occurred.”</p>\n<p>Sean Jensen, the president of Polu Kai Services, defended the draft report, noting the contractors never had a chance to finish it. “We did our job,” he said. “I’m happy with the team’s work.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, another concern had surfaced, this one limited to Gardner. Staff members, who have since left OSMRE, told Pizarchik they believed Gardner was trying to undermine the Stream Protection Rule. They accused him of being uncooperative, asserting that he was deliberately misreading parts of the draft rule so he could condemn it as an overly broad ban on underground mining. (In an email, Gardner described himself as cooperative and his reading of the rule as correct.)</p>\n<p>Gardner had spent decades consulting for coal companies and would later be elected president of a major professional association for the mining industry. A Kentucky native, he is fond of observing that, because he grew up on a tobacco farm, he has “the honor of being involved in the two most politically incorrect industries in the country.”</p>\n<p>The dispute between the contractors and the agency came to a head in January 2011. The Associated Press had published a leaked draft of the contractors’ initial analysis. It suggested that the Stream Protection Rule would have a devastating impact, wiping out 7,000 mining jobs nationwide.</p>\n<p>OSMRE officials disputed the accuracy of the projection, but by then it was too late. The job-loss figure had become a part of the public discourse around the agency’s incipient rule.</p>\n<p>The fallout from the leak prompted a series of at times heated meetings at which OSMRE officials and the contractors tried to resolve their differences. The endeavor proved unsuccessful, and in March 2011, agency officials declined to renew the contract. They hired a new set of contractors to complete the project, though they retained Morgan Worldwide. (John Morgan, president of Morgan Worldwide, said agency officials never complained about his company’s work.)</p>\n<p>Congress, however, wouldn’t let the issue rest. Republicans had found in the dramatic job-loss figure powerful ammunition for their fight against the Obama administration’s coal policy. “It was all about blocking everything the Obama administration wanted to do,” Pizarchik said. “Everything was a war on coal.”</p>\n<p>At congressional hearings in November 2011, the tensions between OSMRE and the contractors spilled into the open. When one congressman declared that the Stream Protection Rule “will kill jobs and stop coal mining,” Pizarchik accused the contractors of producing job-loss projections with “no basis in fact.” Incensed, Gardner testified two weeks later that OSMRE officials had put pressure on the contractors to manipulate their analysis to obscure the reality that the rule would decimate the American coal industry.</p>\n<p>The dispute attracted the attention of the inspector general for the Department of the Interior, which ultimately produced a report that criticized both sides. The IG concluded that OSMRE officials had managed the contracting process poorly, but found no evidence to support Gardner’s claim that administration officials had tried to improperly influence the contractors’ work. The contractors’ job-loss figures, investigators concluded in their 2013 report, weren’t fabricated, but they relied on little more than claims of expertise.</p>\n<p>“The contractor and subcontractor could not identify any of the assumptions they made,” Pizarchik said. “Staff reported to me they said, ‘We’re the experts. That’s our opinion. Rely on that.’ ... It was purely their opinion derived through the ‘expert elicitation process.’” (Gardner disputed this, saying the assumptions “were clearly identified.”)</p>\n<p>All these years later, Gardner has come out on top in one respect. In February, less than a month after the Stream Protection Rule went into effect, Congress nullified it. In the intervening years, Gardner had continued to denounce OSMRE and the Stream Protection Rule in lectures, on his Facebook page and in newspaper op-eds.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether the victory proves Pyrrhic. “I think it’s a fatal flaw,” John Morgan, Gardner’s fellow subcontractor, said. “If you abused civil servants and accused them of the types of actions he did, it would be very difficult to be a leader.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7703062.gif\" height=\"1\">",

When I was little, my parents would read stories to me every night. I started becoming a voracious reader and was always interested in this idea of stories. Journalism seemed to be this interesting intersection of storytelling, current events, history and the future, which is something I’m innately interested in. I was a kid reporter for The Denver Post’s kids section, which is my hometown paper. I really loved this idea that you could go interview someone and have the license to just ask them questions. I was also a fan of Radio Disney at the time, and we got to do segments on air. That really got me excited. I thought, “Hey, maybe journalism is something I’d want to do.” I was on my high school newspaper staff and ended up pursuing journalism in college. It’s been an element that has always been a part of me. </p>\n<p><strong>How would you explain to readers your job as a digital producer?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, I help get our stories on the internet. That involves producing the story in our content management system and making sure we have multimedia assets, whether that’s art, prepping video embeds, things like that. Making sure the look, feel and design is something that will make sense for the reader. It’s working with the reporters and editors in Illinois and also coordinating with the design and production team in New York. </p>\n<p><strong>What has been your most rewarding experience as a journalist and digital producer?</strong></p>\n<p>The most rewarding experience is seeing stories that either I helped produce or I reported reach audiences. In my last job, I worked on <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/06/21/are-traffic-stops-prone-to-racial-bias\">a long-term investigation focused on police interactions with the public</a>. We collected traffic stops data from around the country, and one of the most exciting parts for me was not necessarily the stories that our group did about possible racial bias, but the fact that we were able to clean and give that data to local newsrooms around the country. Then seeing those newsrooms reporting on how policing affects their community. I was excited to just see how you can break off a piece of a reporting project and help fellow local journalists around the country.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you excited about producing with ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>One thing that really excites me about web producing here is we’re really thinking about the reader. My interest in investigative journalism is why I wanted to come to ProPublica Illinois. I’m excited about the reporting that happens here, but also by this question: How do you make sure that really important reporting is being seen by audiences, having impact and also is in a form that makes sense? Right now, we’re producing for the web, but I’m interested in how might you translate an especially interesting investigation for when someone’s commuting by bus to their job, driving in the car or getting ready for work at home. How might we best serve readers on a single story beyond just our website?</p>\n<p><strong>What are some underreported stories in Illinois that you wish had more coverage?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say environmental topics. There’s a lot of opportunity for investigating both how the private sector and public sector interact when it comes to environmental policy and compliance with laws that protect our environment. That’s something to explore here in Chicago, but also all across the state. I’m interested in meeting people living here to better understand that.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you hope the stories that you help produce at ProPublica Illinois will spark change?</strong></p>\n<p>As a producer, I want to make sure we can create story packages where the design is almost invisible in a way, that it’s beautiful and the reader enjoys it, but it’s not ever in the way. It lets people focus on the stories because that’s ultimately what it’s about, whether someone is reading something on their phone or on their computer.</p>\n<p><strong>What storytelling and/or web production techniques would you like to experiment with at ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m interested in exploring how we can deliver a story in the best way. How do you deliver one investigation in the way someone wants to consume it and based on the context they're in? And how are we putting together a story package in a way that someone from Chicago will be interested in and want to consume but also someone in Carbondale in southern Illinois. I’m also interested in starting to think about what devices or tools might everyday people be using in five, 10, 20 years. Are people actually going to be using smart speakers? Is it a fad now or would we all want to eat our waffles in the morning and listen to Alexa read us the news? If, 20 years from now, driverless cars are a mainstream thing and you don’t have to be at the wheel, how might a news story be presented there? Is it just going to be a TV news story or are there new ways to think about that? I’m really interested in the future. </p>\n<p><strong>What has been the biggest lesson journalism has taught you?</strong></p>\n<p>I know it’s cliché to say, but everyone has a story. I found early in my reporting <a href=\"https://www.vigneshr.com/\">career</a> that some of the most interesting stories came from the most unexpected moments, whether that was having coffee with someone or sitting through a two-hour city council meeting. Oftentimes, some of the most interesting characters, stories or sources would come out of that. It’s being aware and listening at all moments and just being receptive. It often happens organically if you’re listening.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7701502.gif\" height=\"1\">",

      "summary": {
        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ryan-gabrielson\">Ryan Gabrielson</a> </p>\n<p>More than 30 years ago, Congress identified what it said was a grave threat to the American promise of equal justice for all: Federal judges were giving wildly different punishments to defendants who had committed the same crimes.</p>\n<p>The worries were many. Some lawmakers feared lenient judges were giving criminals too little time in prison. Others suspected African-American defendants were being unfairly sentenced to steeper prison terms than white defendants.</p>\n<p>In 1984, Congress created the U.S. Sentencing Commission with remarkable bipartisan support. The commission would set firm punishment rules, called “guidelines,” for every offense. The measure, signed by President Ronald Reagan, largely stripped federal judges of their sentencing powers; they were now to use a chart to decide penalties for each conviction, with few exceptions.</p>\n<p>Five years later, a legal challenge to the sentencing commission wound up before the U.S. Supreme Court. In a case titled <em>Mistretta v. U.S.</em>, the court was asked to consider whether Congress had overreached by taking on what seemed to be a role for the judiciary. In <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/87-7028\">an 8-1 decision</a>, the justices determined that the sentencing commission was constitutional. And they took care to say that the commission was also needed — to end the widespread and “shameful” sentencing disparities produced by the biases of individual judges.</p>\n<p><em>Mistretta</em> was a momentous decision, but it’s now clear the high court relied on evidence that was flimsy and even flat-out wrong.</p>\n<p>The justices, in issuing the 1989 decision, had cited a single congressional report in concluding that there were disturbing and unacceptable sentencing disparities that needed to be addressed. That single report, in turn, was based primarily on two studies conducted in the early 1970s, both deeply flawed.</p>\n<p>One of the studies was an experiment that surveyed federal judges about sentences they might give in hypothetical cases. Asked what sentences they would give in a specific tax fraud case, for example, the prison terms recommended by the judges ranged from three to 20 years.</p>\n<p>That sounds significant. But the experiment ignored a basic fact about the real-life workings of the federal courts: Judges acted as the sole arbiter of sentences in a tiny fraction of cases. The vast majority of sentences were the result of plea bargains negotiated by prosecutors and defense lawyers, deals that were subject to a judge’s approval but that were not his or her handiwork. If fact, there was no evidence offered that judges around the country were signing off on vastly different plea bargain terms. And later research would debunk the claim.</p>\n<p>The other study compared average sentences in federal district courts and indicated prison terms for identical crimes were often years longer or shorter depending on where judges presided. But an examination by ProPublica shows that the study was riddled with sample size errors that should have rendered much of the data unusable.</p>\n<p>For example, the study said the average prison term for larceny in federal courts nationwide was three years and four months. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062874-1972fedsentence-Chart.html#document/p1/a391946\">In Maine</a>, the average was listed as 12 years, more than three times as harsh. But our examination of the underlying data shows that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062873-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X4.html#document/p3/a378459\">only one person</a> was sentenced to prison for larceny in Maine’s lone federal court that year; the “average” used by the congressional study was based on a single conviction.</p>\n<p>The study — done for a Senate committee working on sentencing reform and using data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts — was also distorted by an outright mistake. The study claimed Kentucky’s eastern district court sentenced burglary convicts to, on average, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062874-1972fedsentence-Chart.html#document/p1/a391947\">nearly 14 years in prison</a> in 1972, which appears remarkably punitive for a property crime and out of whack with courts in the rest of the country. The study’s data, not the judges, was the problem, it turns out.</p>\n<p>ProPublica’s review shows Kentucky’s eastern district had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062873-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X4.html#document/p46/a378461\">only four prison sentences</a> for burglary that year. Three of the convicts were adults who received an average prison term of three years and four months. The fourth case involved a juvenile defendant supposedly sentenced to 550 months — more than 45 years — in a cell. The maximum sentence for burglary was 15 years, making that an impossibility, but the mistake wound up in the report that helped shape the thinking of the nation’s highest court. Court officials in Kentucky told ProPublica they could not determine what the juvenile’s sentence had actually been.</p>\n<p>In recent months, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/supreme-court-errors-are-not-hard-to-find\">ProPublica has fact-checked</a> a sampling of the Supreme Court’s majority opinions from 2011 through 2015, and found a number of errors or glaring inaccuracies. The errors came from legal filings, from government records and from the independent research by the justices themselves.</p>\n<p>In the case of the sentencing commission, the court’s decision proved enormously consequential. The federal sentencing guidelines produced by the commission helped remake the nation’s prisons. During the following decade, far more people went to prisons to serve far longer sentences.</p>\n<p>“The guidelines did increase severity, pretty much across the board,” said Kate Stith, a Yale University law professor and expert on the federal sentencing commission.</p>\n<p>Individual states followed the federal lead and instituted sentencing guidelines for state offenses, similarly lengthening prison terms and inflating prison populations.</p>\n<p>Yet ample scholarship done over 30 years has only made clearer that the central rationale for the commission’s creation — large and pervasive discrepancies in sentencing imposed by judges — never existed.</p>\n<p>Multiple sophisticated analyses of court data have found that judges, when left to deliver sentences on their own, do not differ greatly. Before the guidelines took effect, the average difference between judges was roughly <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4065817-Interjudge-Sentencedisparity.html#document/p1/a391950\">five</a> to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4243317-Effect-of-the-Federal-Sentencing-Guidelines-on.html#document/p51/a391951\">eight months</a> — not years, as the congressional report claimed and the nation’s highest court believed. After the guidelines were instituted, additional analysis has shown, the difference between sentences shrank by roughly a month.</p>\n<p>Today, the sentencing commission’s guidelines are merely “advisory,” not mandatory, as a result of several subsequent Supreme Court decisions involving whether aspects of the guidelines violated a defendant’s right to trial. Today, judges can largely disregard the rules so long as they explain their reasoning.</p>\n<p>The purported sentencing disparities that spurred the guidelines in the first place were not considered in the later rulings that restored federal judges’ discretion.</p>\n<p>ProPublica requested comment from Chief Justice John Roberts and the other justices. As they had when presented with the earlier errors in opinions uncovered by ProPublica, the justices declined to respond.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To a significant degree, the drive for sentencing reform started with Marvin Frankel, a veteran federal judge in New York in the early 1970s. Frankel believed he and his colleagues were too easily swayed by biases and passions — in short, judges were too human — to be trusted with handing out criminal penalties on their own. Frankel’s book, “Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order,” published in 1973, became a rallying-cry for a movement.</p>\n<p>“The almost wholly unchecked and sweeping powers we give to judges in the fashioning of sentences are terrifying and intolerable for a society that professes devotion to the rule of law,” Frankel wrote. The federal courts lacked strict rules for the appropriate punishment for each crime and individual judges reached wildly different sentences in similar cases, he argued. “The result is chaos.”</p>\n<p>Stith, the Yale professor and expert on the sentencing commission, said Frankel’s argument found an eager audience. Republicans and Democrats, she said, had for years been promoting their own narratives — of the too-punitive “hanging judge” or the too-lenient “bleeding heart judge” — to suit their agendas.</p>\n<p>Frankel wasn’t done after his book was published. He next helped to oversee an experiment that further fed such narratives. The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals — which includes New York, Connecticut and Vermont — sent <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4165493-Secondcircuit-1974study.html\">20 hypothetical criminal case files</a> to its judges and asked them to choose sentences. The files described an array of convictions, including many white-collar and illegal drug trade crimes.</p>\n<p>The judges answered quite differently. On <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4165493-Secondcircuit-1974study.html#document/p67/a391956\">a financial fraud and tax evasion case</a>, one judge chose a three-year prison term for the convict while two colleagues gave 20 years. For a case of <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4165493-Secondcircuit-1974study.html#document/p74/a391957\">theft involving interstate transport</a>, the chosen punishments ranged from more than seven years in prison to mere probation.</p>\n<p>Ilene Nagel, then a law and sociology professor at Indiana University, said the conclusion to be drawn from the experiment was clear: Judges produced unacceptably divergent sentences.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t a contested issue,” said Nagel, who was one of the first appointees to the sentencing commission.</p>\n<p>The calls for reform were bipartisan to a degree unthinkable today.</p>\n<p>The resulting legislation proved sweeping. It eliminated the federal parole system and formed a sentencing commission. The new agency would have seven members appointed to six-year terms by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. The commissioners would include judges, academics, prosecutors and defense lawyers. They’d write sentencing guidelines based on the criminal offenses, the defendants’ criminal histories and other factors related to the seriousness of the crime. Their word was binding.</p>\n<p>Sen. Strom Thurmond, the longtime Republican leader from South Carolina, introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/1762\">the bill</a>, which included the sentencing overhaul among several changes in the criminal justice system. Sens. Edward Kennedy and Joe Biden, pillars of the Democratic party, were among the bill’s earliest co-sponsors. Only one senator voted against the measure when it went to the floor in 1984. The House of Representatives passed it easily, with almost 100 “yes” votes to spare.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Second Circuit survey went all but unquestioned for nearly 20 years, until researchers began examining the sentencing guidelines’ effect and gave Frankel’s arguments fresh scrutiny. Most notably, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4066312-Sentencing-Fed-Court.html\">a U.S. Department of Justice study</a> into racial disparities in sentencing in 1993 served as a takedown on the long-heralded experiment.</p>\n<p>“Defendants in many courts plead guilty only after various kinds of agreements are reached regarding charges, sentence recommendations, and even ‘sentence promises,’” the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4066312-Sentencing-Fed-Court.html#document/p36/a391944\">report stated</a>, evaluating the Second Circuit results.</p>\n<p>In real court cases, “it is likely that these dynamics constrained judges in their sentencing decisions,” the Justice Department report added.</p>\n<p>Federal judges were not, in general, sentencing erratically, said Douglas McDonald, an expert in health and criminal justice analysis at the global research firm Abt Associates. That became clear “when you looked at real data,” McDonald said, “not the made-up, simulated thing that Judge Frankel sent around.”</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>The second study the Supreme Court relied on in <em>Mistretta</em> doesn’t fare well under scrutiny, either.</p>\n<p>It looked at sentencing data from actual federal criminal cases. A consultant to the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, which was drafting the sentencing reform legislation in the late 1970s, and a pair of legal scholars from Yale and the University of Texas compiled the numbers from the federal courts system.</p>\n<p>The effort was intended to further prove that sentencing was chaotic, varying greatly by judge and just as significantly by region. The data compared average sentences for certain crime categories between individual district courts to averages for the rest of the country. The authors set out the numbers in easy-to-digest charts, which gave the stark impression that geography dictated the degrees of punishment.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062874-1972fedsentence-Chart.html\">prominent chart</a> showed <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062874-1972fedsentence-Chart.html#document/p1/a391948\">California’s northern district judges</a> sentenced burglary convicts to an average of 10 years in prison in 1972, about twice as long as the national average.</p>\n<p>However, the California district’s “average” was not an average at all. Only one burglary convict was sentenced to prison there during that year, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062873-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X4.html#document/p74/a378460\">data from the study’s appendix</a> shows.</p>\n<p>That problem with sample size was just one of many in the study, which ProPublica scrutinized as part of its reporting on misinformation in the Supreme Court’s majority opinions. ProPublica was fact-checking a 2013 ruling, <em>Peugh v. U.S.</em>, that relied on information from the <em>Mistretta</em> opinion about the sentencing commission.</p>\n<p>ProPublica unearthed hundreds of pages containing four-decades-old federal courts data to test the sentencing averages study. It appears to be the first time the research has been rigorously checked.</p>\n<p>The study’s first criminal category — homicide and assault — is so riddled with sample size flaws its figures are useless. Averages for the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062873-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X4.html#document/p19/a378457\">Maryland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062873-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X4.html#document/p19/a378457\">New Jersey</a> judges are based on two cases in each case. (State courts generally handle violent crimes so it makes sense that federal courts did not hand out many such sentences.)</p>\n<p>While the Supreme Court's <em>Mistretta</em> opinion and lawmakers repeatedly said that judges’ sentencing disparities could not be explained by defendants’ criminal histories, the analyses of federal data they depended on did not address the question.</p>\n<p>For instance, the congressional report singled out the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062874-1972fedsentence-Chart.html#document/p1/a391969\">Illinois northern district court</a> as unjustifiably lenient on robbery convicts; it averaged prison terms of less than seven years in 1972 compared to the national average of 10 years.</p>\n<p>But it turns out <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4324406-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X5.html#document/p20/a391963\">robbery convicts in the Illinois court</a> were a lot different than those across the country. A majority had no criminal history at all, and only 28 percent had previously served time in prison. The shorter sentences, then, were easier to understand.</p>\n<p>Nationwide, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4324406-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X5.html#document/p33/a391966\">most federal robbery convicts</a> had substantial criminal histories, and 50 percent of them had previously served prison time.</p>\n<p>Further illustrating the point, judges in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062874-1972fedsentence-Chart.html#document/p1/a391971\">Missouri eastern district</a> averaged 15-year prison sentences for robbery, several years longer than the national average. But 85 percent of <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4324406-1972FedOffendersUSDistCts-X5.html#document/p24/a391964\">that court’s convicts</a> had been in prison before. The underlying data suggests that defendants with bad criminal histories often received longer prison sentences.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The sentencing guidelines took effect in November 1987. One month later, John Mistretta was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Missouri, for which he pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received 18 months in prison under the new rules. He appealed his punishment, arguing that the commission and its work violated the separation of powers required in the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Lawyers for the federal government defending the guidelines provided the congressional report, containing the judge experiment and district sentencing averages, to the Supreme Court. The case centered on legal arguments, not questions about the statistical evidence.</p>\n<p>Rather, the justices and lawyers treated the crisis of sentencing judges as established fact. “Congress wanted to fetter the power that individual judges had been exercising, because they are the ones who created the problem,” Justice Anthony Kennedy said during <a href=\"https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/rehnquist3/oral_argument_audio/18725\">oral arguments</a> in <em>Mistretta</em>. “They are the ones who gave the disparate sentences all around the country.”</p>\n<p>Paul Bator, who represented the sentencing commission, described federal judges’ control of criminal punishment as being “very ugly days of discriminatory and arbitrary sentencing.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/488/361/case.html\">the majority opinion</a>, Justice Harry Blackmun referred to sentencing disparities among judges as “a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective operation of the criminal justice system.”</p>\n<p>The consequences of the court’s ruling were considerable and have helped fuel sharp debates about issues such as mass incarceration.</p>\n<p>In 1984, the average prison term handed down by federal courts was two years. That more than doubled over the decade that followed, according to figures from the sentencing commission. About half of federal convicts received probation when judges controlled most of the sentencing. Only 7 percent got probation last year.</p>\n<p>Stith, the Yale professor, said the sentencing commission’s guidelines came to include sentencing “enhancements,” such as whether a defendant attempted to destroy evidence or had access to a weapon. They became a major part of the new punishment formula and had the effect of lengthening sentences.</p>\n<p>Those “enhancements” eventually became the focus of another case that wound up before the Supreme Court. Lawyers for defendants argued that the sentencing enhancements were akin to convictions for additional crimes, crimes that had not been proven as part of the criminal prosecutions. The Supreme Court eventually barred the use of the enhanced penalties.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<div>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/supreme-court-errors-are-not-hard-to-find\">\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171017-scotus-errors-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171017-scotus-errors-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171017-scotus-errors-3x2.jpg 1200w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171017-scotus-errors-3x2.jpg\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/supreme-court-errors-are-not-hard-to-find\">It’s a Fact: Supreme Court Errors Aren’t Hard to Find</a></h3>\n<h4>A ProPublica review adds fuel to a longstanding worry about the nation’s highest court: The justices can botch the truth, sometimes in cases of great import.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>But the creation and legal endorsement of the commission preceded a variety of developments that led to harsher penalties in court. Congress, for instance, made the punishment for crack cocaine much more severe than for powder cocaine. In 1985, the federal prison population consisted of just over 40,000 inmates, according to <a href=\"https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp#old_pops\">U.S. Bureau of Prisons data</a>. During the decade that followed, with fixed prison sentences and tough anti-drug laws, the prison rolls grew by 150 percent and topped 100,000 inmates in 1995.</p>\n<p>Nagel, the former commissioner and law professor, said the anti-drug laws are to blame for most of the severe penalties that swelled the federal prison population. Commissioners tried to prevent, or at least minimize, the harshest sentencing changes, she said.</p>\n<p>“On several occasions, the commission tried to get Congress to back away,” Nagel said. She and her colleagues argued to lawmakers that violent crimes should be the priority for long sentences, not drugs. Their lobbying failed.</p>\n<p>Drug prosecutions, in the end, produced their own set of disparities — disproportionate numbers of minority defendants. In 1996, 73 percent of those convicted for drug trafficking were black or Hispanic, roughly triple their share of the nation’s population. Researchers had struggled for decades to demonstrate racial disparities in federal sentencing. Suddenly, the gaps were glaring and repeatedly proven.</p>\n<p>Indeed, sentencing disparities by race remain prevalent as ever, according to <a href=\"https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing\">an analysis</a> the commission released last month. Black men’s prison terms the past two years were 19 percent longer, on average, than those received by white men, the study shows. The difference cannot be explained by the crimes or the defendants’ criminal histories. The sentencing commission says there is no sign the racial gap for incarceration is getting smaller.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7690794.gif\" height=\"1\">",

But increasingly, consumers are finding that isn't the case.</p>\n<p>Patrik Swanljung found this out when he went to fill a prescription for a generic cholesterol drug. In May, Swanljung handed his Medicare prescription card to the pharmacist at his local Walgreens and was told that he owed $83.94 for a three-month supply.</p>\n<p>Alarmed at that price, Swanljung went online and found Blink Health, a start-up, offering the same drug — generic Crestor — for $45.89.</p>\n<p>It had struck a better deal than did his insurer, UnitedHealthcare. &quot;It's completely ridiculous,&quot; said Swanljung, 72, who lives in Anacortes, Washington.</p>\n<p>In an era when drug prices have ignited public outrage and insurers are requiring consumers to shoulder more of the costs, people are shocked to discover they can sometimes get better deals than their own insurers. Behind the seemingly simple act of buying a bottle of pills, a host of players — drug companies, pharmacies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers — are taking a cut of the profits, even as consumers are left to fend for themselves, critics say.</p>\n<p>Although there are no nationwide figures to track how often consumers could have gotten a better deal on their own, one industry expert estimated that up to 10 percent of drug transactions involve such situations. If true nationwide, that figure could total as many as 400 million prescriptions a year. The system has become so complex that &quot;there's no chance that a consumer can figure it out without help,&quot; said the expert, Michael Rea, chief executive of <a href=\"https://rxsavingssolutions.com/\">Rx Savings Solutions</a>, whose company is paid by employers to help them lower workers' drug costs.</p>\n<p>Pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that deal with drug benefits on behalf of insurers, often negotiate better prices for consumers, particularly for brand-name medications, Rea said, but that's not necessarily true for some generic drugs. Insurers' clients are frequently employers overseeing large numbers of workers, and the companies are focused on overall costs. So when insurers seek deals for generic drugs, they do so in batches, reaching agreements for groups of different drugs rather than getting the lowest price on every drug.</p>\n<p>As a result of these complicated layers of negotiation, which are not made public, different insurers end up paying different prices for individual drugs. Further compounding confusion for consumers, some insurers require a set co-payment for each prescription — say, $15 or $20 — even when the insurer reimburses the pharmacy at a much cheaper rate.</p>\n<p>Several companies have emerged to capitalize on consumer anger over the confusing variations in price. The players include not only <a href=\"https://www.blinkhealth.com/\">Blink Health</a> and its better-known competitor <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/\">GoodRx</a>, but also veteran businesses like the benefit manager Express Scripts, which recently helped to <a href=\"https://insiderx.com/\">start a subsidiary</a> aimed at cash-paying consumers. Amazon, the online behemoth, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/amazon-pharmacy-drugs.html\">is also said to be considering</a> whether to join the fray.</p>\n<p>Last Sunday, CVS Health <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/business/dealbook/cvs-is-said-to-agree-to-buy-aetna-reshaping-health-care-industry.html\">announced plans to merge</a> with health insurer Aetna, a move that would create a corporate behemoth that many have said would have little incentive to serve the needs of regular people. Some consumers say their experience with CVS already demonstrates how easy it is to fall through the cracks. In one case, a customer whose plan was managed by CVS Caremark, the drug benefit manager, would have had to pay more for a drug through her plan at a CVS than what she ended up paying at the same store, with a coupon from GoodRx.</p>\n<p>Representatives for insurers and pharmacy benefit managers say cases like Swanljung's are &quot;outliers.&quot; &quot;There are three to four billion generic scripts written a year, and in the vast majority of cases, they are going to get a better deal by using insurance,&quot; said <a href=\"https://www.pcmanet.org/about/mark-merritt/\">Mark Merritt</a>, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents benefit managers.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for UnitedHealthcare, Swanljung's insurer, noted that while Swanljung got a lower price for generic Crestor by using Blink Health, he also takes four other prescriptions, for which he got a better deal through his insurance. (Swanljung gave UnitedHealthcare permission to discuss his situation.) Having insurance is clearly valuable, said the spokesman, Matt Burns. In addition, the co-payment for generic Crestor, also called rosuvastatin, in Swanljung's plan is set to decrease significantly in January, in large part because the price of the drug has dropped this year.</p>\n<p>Consumers also may face penalties if they don't use their insurance and pay cash to save money. In many cases, insurers won't let them apply those purchases to a deductible or out-of-pocket spending maximum.</p>\n<p>Still, many find that leaving their prescription card at home is worth it. Some have found a better deal even at pharmacies that are owned by their drug plan, like CVS.</p>\n<p>Susan Thomson, 55, a university lecturer who lives in Summit, New Jersey, is covered by a high-deductible plan through her former employer. Her drug benefits are managed by CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health. For at least a decade, she's been using a prescription lotion called sulfacetamide sodium to treat rosacea, a skin condition.</p>\n<p>Last year, each time she filled her prescription at a CVS pharmacy, she paid $75.07. Checking the CVS Caremark website this year, she learned that the cost had gone up to $99.03 (or $81.51 if she used CVS's mail order service).</p>\n<p>Investigating further, she found that GoodRx offered the same prescription at the same drugstore for $75.57, without her insurance. The prices were even lower at other pharmacies.</p>\n<p>&quot;It just doesn't seem right,&quot; she said. &quot;I just feel that the pharmaceutical industry and health care industry are pulling these numbers out of thin air.&quot;</p>\n<p>Michael DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, did not dispute the details of Thomson's experience, but said it is rare and attributed the price disparity to her high-deductible plan. Because consumers are responsible for their costs in those plans until they hit their deductible, DeAngelis said it would take them longer to reach it and they might end up spending more in the long run.</p>\n<p>Prices can also vary widely from month to month when consumers pay cash, he said.</p>\n<p>Drug-discount cards have been around for decades, and retailers like Walmart have also offered cheap generic drug programs, but both were mainly used by people without insurance.</p>\n<p>That is changing. Even as more Americans have health insurance since the Affordable Care Act was passed, insurers are increasingly asking consumers to pay a larger share of their costs. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Advantage/Plan-Payment/CGDP.html\">about five million people</a> in Medicare hit a stage in which they had to pick up a greater share of their expenses.</p>\n<p>Reporters at ProPublica and The New York Times examined whether they could get better prices on 100 of the most prescribed drugs, identified by GoodRx, without using their insurance. ProPublica's prescription claims are managed by OptumRx, a large pharmacy benefit manager owned by UnitedHealth Group; The Times's medication coverage for reporters is managed by Express Scripts.</p>\n<p>Both reporters found lower prices on GoodRx for at least 40 drugs on the list (many were drugs that can be purchased for $4 at Walmart, without any coupon).</p>\n<p>Blink Health also sometimes beat the insurance out-of-pocket costs, but less often than GoodRx. Blink Health recently suffered a series of setbacks when two of the largest drugstore chains, CVS and Walgreens, stopped accepting its discounts, along with a grocery chain, Publix. In November, Blink Health sued its pharmacy benefit manager, which negotiates its prices, claiming that the company, MedImpact, had violated their agreement. MedImpact has not yet formally responded to the allegations in federal court in New York.</p>\n<p>GoodRx, a private company founded in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/\">displays the deals</a> it has with nine pharmacy benefit managers, each offering different prices for different drugs.</p>\n<p>&quot;We said, let's see if we can gather all these prices and see if we can exploit the variation in these contracts,&quot; said Doug Hirsch, GoodRx's co-founder and co-chief executive, &quot;to see if we can provide better value.&quot;</p>\n<p>Dr. Brad Wainer, a family-practice doctor in Berwyn, Illinois, said he frequently shows patients their options on GoodRx to see if they can get a better price. &quot;Most of them don't believe me until they go and they find it out for themselves,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Consumers may also pay more if they are covered by plans that require them to pay a set co-payment, no matter the cash price. In some of those cases, the insurers require the pharmacies to send them the difference between what they collect from the consumer and what the insurers have agreed to reimburse the pharmacies.</p>\n<p>After a New Orleans television station, WVUE, <a href=\"http://www.fox8live.com/story/31891070/zurik-copay-or-you-pay-prescription-drug-clawbacks-draw-fire\">reported last year</a> on this practice, known as a clawback, lawyers across the country <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-prescription-benefit-class-action-1015-20161014-story.html\">filed lawsuits</a> accusing the insurers — including Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare — of overcharging consumers. The companies are contesting the suits.</p>\n<p>Several independent pharmacists said there might be safety issues if consumers buy drugs at different pharmacies. If those prescriptions are filled without an insurance card, pharmacy systems may not catch dangerous drug interactions. &quot;That, to me, is a recipe for disaster,&quot; said Craig Seither, who owns Fort Thomas Drug Center in Fort Thomas, Kentucky.</p>\n<p>Mary Furman, a retired medical social worker in Charlotte, North Carolina, takes the drug celecoxib, the generic version of Celebrex, to treat her rheumatoid arthritis. When she went to fill a 90-day prescription in April, her pharmacy told her she would owe $96.89 if she used her Medicare plan, offered by SilverScript, run by CVS Health.</p>\n<p>Then the pharmacy offered her a deal — $72.25 if she paid cash, a price the worker said was the same the pharmacy would offer any customer. &quot;I was flabbergasted,&quot; said Furman, who is 72.</p>\n<p>Furman took the deal, and afterward, her husband, Nelson, called SilverScript to report what happened. The representative told Nelson Furman he was &quot;not surprised.&quot;</p>\n<p>The couple then reported the experience to a company hired by Medicare to investigate fraud, but a representative encouraged her to contact the health plan again.</p>\n<p>After reporters sent details of Furman's case to CVS, Nelson Furman said they received a call from the SilverScript president. DeAngelis, the CVS spokesman, blamed the pharmacy for charging the couple more than what their share should have been using their insurance. (Medicare rules require that consumers always get the lower price of their set co-payment and a pharmacy's cash price.)</p>\n<p>Now the Furmans are looking at drug coverage for next year, and once again, they see huge variation in prices for that drug and others.</p>\n<p>&quot;The prices are all over the map,&quot; Nelson Furman said.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7669604.gif\" height=\"1\">",

Most of the big pharmacy benefit managers (the companies that manage your drug benefits on behalf of your insurer) allow you to search for drugs on their websites to see what you’ll owe. This cost will vary depending on whether your plan requires you to meet a deductible, which is a fixed amount before your coverage kicks in, make a co-payment or pay a percentage of the list price. The major pharmacy benefit managers are <a href=\"https://www.express-scripts.com/\">Express Scripts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.optumrx.com/public/landing\">OptumRx</a> and <a href=\"https://www.caremark.com/wps/portal\">CVS Caremark</a>.</p>\n<h3>Brand or Generic?</h3>\n<p>Determine whether your drug is a newer, brand-name drug that is sold by one drug maker at a premium, or whether it is a generic product that is often cheaper and sold by multiple companies. If you’re unsure, ask your doctor.</p>\n<h3>Generic Drugs Give You Options</h3>\n<p>Several large retailers, like <a href=\"http://i.walmart.com/i/if/hmp/fusion/genericdruglist.pdf\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/pharmacy/drug-directory-main\">Costco</a>, sell generics at discounted prices, like $4 a prescription, which may be less than your insurance is asking you to pay. Some grocery stores, like <a href=\"http://www.publix.com/pharmacy-wellness/pharmacy/pharmacy-services/free-medication-program\">Publix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.meijer.com/content/content.jsp?pageName=free_prescriptions\">Meijer</a>, even give away certain medications — like antibiotics — for free. Pharmacy chains like <a href=\"https://www.riteaid.com/shop/info/pharmacy/prescription-savings/rite-aid-prescription-savings-program\">Rite Aid</a> also offer discounted prices to people who sign up for savings clubs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodrx.com/\">GoodRx</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blinkhealth.com/\">Blink Health</a> are two companies that offer discounted rates on generic drugs. GoodRx allows consumers to compare what local pharmacies are charging for a drug (it includes prices from discount stores like Walmart), while Blink Health quotes a single price that it has negotiated. GoodRx offers coupons that consumers bring to participating pharmacies, while Blink Health requires users to pay upfront, then collect their prescription at a nearby pharmacy.</p>\n<h3>Brand-Name Drugs</h3>\n<p>Check the website of the drug you’re taking. Some companies offer discounts (often called copay coupon cards) to help cover insured patients’ out-of-pocket costs, at least for the first few months. But people who are covered by government programs like Medicare are prohibited from using these programs, and sometimes the discounts are capped for those without insurance.</p>\n<p>Depending on your income, you may also qualify for patient-assistance programs, which are either run by the drug maker or a charity that is financed by the drug maker.</p>\n<p>Drug makers do not necessarily offer these programs out of a sense of charity — the programs <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-19/the-real-reason-big-pharma-wants-to-help-pay-for-your-prescription\">help boost their bottom line</a> by ensuring that patients will continue on their drugs (while sticking insurers with the bulk of the drug’s bill). And sometimes the help is more trouble than it’s worth. Some discounts are valid for a limited period, leaving patients in the lurch when they expire. Other programs can end without notice. But for those with little other choice, every bit helps.</p>\n<p>Also, it never hurts to ask your doctor if there is a similar drug available that may cost you less.</p>\n<h3>Ask Your Pharmacist for a Deal</h3>\n<p>Many pharmacies — especially independent ones — offer cash-paying customers prices that are lower than a drug’s sticker price. When handing over your insurance card, it’s worth asking if you can get a better deal by paying cash.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7669605.gif\" height=\"1\">",

She remains blocked. According to documents ProPublica obtained through an open-records request this summer, hers is one of 494 accounts that Hogan blocks. Blocked accounts include a schoolteacher who criticized the governor’s education policies and a pastor who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2017/02/09/meet-some-people-blocked-from-gov-hogans-facebook-page/?postshare=5791486659847043&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.460ed4eb624f\">opposed the governor’s stance</a> against accepting Syrian refugees. They even have their own Facebook group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/254061628339792/members/\">Marylanders Blocked by Larry Hogan on Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p>Hogan’s office says they “diligently adhere” to their <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Doc.pdf\">social media policy</a> when deleting comments and blocking users.</p>\n<p>In August, ProPublica filed public-records requests with every governor and 22 federal agencies, asking for lists of everyone blocked on their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. The responses we’ve received so far show that governors and agencies across the country are blocking at least 1,298 accounts. More than half of those — 652 accounts — are blocked by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican.</p>\n<p>Four other Republican governors and four Democrats, as well as five federal agencies, block hundreds of others, according to their responses to our requests. Five Republican governors and three Democrats responded that they are not blocking any accounts at all. Many agencies and more than half of governors’ offices have not yet responded to our requests. Most of the blocked accounts appear to belong to humans but some could be “bots,” or automated accounts.</p>\n<p>When the administrator of a public Facebook page or Twitter handle blocks an account, the blocked user can no longer comment on posts. That can create an inaccurate public image of support for government policies. (<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-find-out-if-your-elected-officials-are-blocking-constituents-on-facebook-and-twitter\">Here’s how you can dig into whether your elected officials are blocking constituents.</a>)</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Help Us Investigate</h3>\n<p>If you’re interested in finding out who is blocked in your home state or municipality, check out our <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-find-out-if-your-elected-officials-are-blocking-constituents-on-facebook-and-twitter\">reporting recipe</a>.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>ProPublica made the records requests and asked readers for their own examples after we <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-not-the-only-one-blocking-constituents-on-twitterhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-not-the-only-one-blocking-constituents-on-twitter\">detailed</a> multiple instances of officials blocking constituents.</p>\n<p>We heard from dozens of people. The governors’ offices in Alaska, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska and New Jersey did not respond to our requests for records, but residents in each of those states reported being blocked. People were blocked after commenting on everything from marijuana legislation to Medicaid to a local green jobs bill.</p>\n<p>For some, being blocked means losing one of few means to communicate with their elected representatives. Ann-Meredith McNeill, who lives in western rural Kentucky, told ProPublica that Bevin rarely visits anywhere near her. McNeill said she feels like “the internet is all I have” for interacting with the governor.</p>\n<p>McNeill said she was blocked after criticizing Bevin’s position on abortion rights. (Last January, Bevin’s administration <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2017/01/14/lexington-abortion-clinic-close-leaving-1-ky/96587994/\">won a lawsuit that resulted in closing one of Kentucky’s two abortion clinics</a>, the event that McNeill says inspired her comment.)</p>\n<p>In response to questions about its social media blocking policies, Bevin’s office said in a statement that “a small number of users misuse [social media] outlets by posting obscene and abusive language or images, or repeated off-topic comments and spam. Constituents of all ages should be able to engage in civil discourse with Gov. Bevin via his social media platforms without being subjected to vulgarity or abusive trolls.” McNeill told ProPublica, “I’m sure I got sassy” but she made “no threats or anything.”</p>\n<p>Almost every federal agency that responded is blocking accounts. The Department of Veterans Affairs blocked 18 accounts as of July, but said most were originally blocked before 2014. The blocked accounts included a Michigan law firm specializing in auto accident cases and a Virginia real estate consultant who told ProPublica she had “no idea why” she was blocked. The Department of Energy blocked eight accounts as of October. The Department of Labor blocked seven accounts. And the Small Business Administration blocked two accounts, both of which were unverified and claimed to be affiliated with government loan programs.</p>\n<p>Many governors and agencies gave us only partial lists or rejected our requests altogether. Outgoing Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s office told us they would not share their block lists due to “privacy concerns for those people whose names might appear on it.” Alabama declined to provide public records because <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4312422-Alabama-Governor-Social-Media-Blocking-Response.html#document/p1/a390333\">our request did not come from an Alabama citizen</a>.</p>\n<p>Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens’ office declined to share records from his Facebook or Twitter accounts, arguing they are not “<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4312423-Missouri-Governor-Social-Media-Blocking-Response.html#document/p1/a390334\">considered to be the ‘official’ social media accounts of the Governor of Missouri</a>” because he created them before he took office.</p>\n<p>Increased attention on the issue of blocking seems to be having an impact. In September, the California-based <a href=\"https://firstamendmentcoalition.org/2017/09/fac-prompts-disclosure-california-governor-jerry-browns-social-media-block-lists/\">First Amendment Coalition revealed</a> that California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, had blocked more than 1,500 accounts until June, shortly before the organization submitted a request for his social media records.</p>\n<p>At some point before fulfilling the coalition’s request, Brown’s office unblocked every account.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndivisibleVT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IndivisibleVT</a> We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

It’s not just President Donald Trump on Twitter and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-political-ads-malware-scams-misleading\">political ads on Facebook</a>. Politicians and agencies across the country use social media to communicate policy, share information and hear from constituents.

Here’s what we found.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>When the administrator of a public Facebook page blocks an account, the user can no longer comment on the page. That can create an inaccurate public image of support for government policies.</p>\n<p>If a city council member, mayor, state representative or governor is blocking or curating their constituents on Facebook and Twitter, that’s important for local reporters to know. Who are these elected officials blocking? Why? And how many? You don’t have to be a reporter, either. California paralegal Angela Greben has submitted dozens of requests for social media block lists and publicizes them on her blog, <a href=\"http://govblock.blogspot.com/?view=flipcard\">“Government Block Lists Revealed.”</a></p>\n<p>We’ve laid out below how you can find out if elected officials are blocking anyone. If you have questions about any step in the process, email us at <a href=\"mailto:getinvolved@propublica.org\">getinvolved@propublica.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Figure Out the Law</h3>\n<p>Look up the relevant open-records laws to make sure that your request includes everything the law requires and that the official or agency are subject to these requests. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide\">maintains a database of open-records laws by state</a>.</p>\n<p>There are differences between states. For example, Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act exempts the governor’s office, legislature and others from the state’s open-records law. The Center for Public Integrity has a helpful <a href=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18822/how-does-your-state-rank-integrity\">state-by-state ranking</a> of public access to government records.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Draft Your Record Requests</h3>\n<p>The National Freedom of Information Coalition has <a href=\"https://www.nfoic.org/organizations/state-sample-foia-request-letters\">sample open-records request letters for each state</a> and both the <a href=\"https://www.ifoia.org/#!/\">Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</a> and <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/\">MuckRock</a> have online tools to create request letters.</p>\n<aside>\n<p><strong>These governors’ offices and federal agencies at least partially responded to our requests for blocked social media accounts.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Governors’ Offices</em></p>\n<p>California Gov. Jerry Brown, Democrat</p>\n<p>Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Democrat</p>\n<p>Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, Republican</p>\n<p>Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Republican</p>\n<p>Kentucky Gov.

You can use it as a template for your requests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A list of all Twitter accounts blocked by @FLGovScott (the official Twitter account of the governor of Florida)</p></li>\n<li><p>All direct messages sent or received by @FLGovScott (the official Twitter account of the governor of Florida)</p></li>\n<li><p>A list of all Facebook accounts blocked by Governor Rick Scott (the official Facebook account of the governor of Florida)</p></li>\n<li><p>A list of all Facebook accounts blocked by Rick Scott (the personal Facebook account of the governor of Florida)</p></li>\n<li><p>All direct messages sent or received by Governor Rick Scott (the official Facebook account of the governor of Florida)</p></li>\n<li><p>All direct messages sent or received by Rick Scott (the personal Facebook account of the governor of Florida)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should include instructions about how to get all of the information requested. For example: “Blocked Twitter accounts can be accessed when logged to any account by going to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/settings/blocked\">https://twitter.com/settings/blocked</a>.”</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Wait...</h3>\n<p>Response times vary wildly. Some of our requests took a matter of days. Others took months. And still others haven’t responded yet.</p>\n<p>Federal agencies and many states are required to acknowledge receipt of your request within 20 working days. If your records can’t be produced in that time, some states are supposed to let you know if they need more time. Whatever you do, keep track of your request.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Prepare for a Back-and-Forth</h3>\n<p>Getting public records often means enduring delays and runarounds. Of the 72 open-records requests that ProPublica sent to governors and federal agencies about social media blocking, seven refused our requests or provided only partial information. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Outgoing Governor of Kansas Sam Brownback’s office told us they would not share their block lists due to “privacy concerns for those people whose names might appear on it.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Alabama declined to provide public records because ProPublica’s request did not come from an Alabama citizen.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4312422-Alabama-Governor-Social-Media-Blocking-Response/annotations/390333.html\">View note</a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Michigan declined to provide records because its governor is not subject to Freedom of Information laws.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4312427-Michigan-Governor-Social-Media-Blocking-Response/annotations/390335.html\">View note</a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>Four states provided incomplete records:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Wyoming provided their Twitter block lists, but no Facebook information.</p></li>\n<li><p>Georgia sent copies of direct messages received by the governor’s Twitter account, but nothing else.</p></li>\n<li><p>Florida also only sent a list of accounts blocked on Twitter. While a verified “public figure” account for Rick Scott does exist, and is regularly updated with press releases from the governor’s office, the office says the account is run by Scott’s political team and is not subject to public-records requests.</p></li>\n<li><p>Gov. Eric Greitens’ office in Missouri also declined to share records from the governor’s Facebook or Twitter accounts, saying neither are “considered to be the ‘official’ social media accounts of the Governor of Missouri.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4312423-Missouri-Governor-Social-Media-Blocking-Response/annotations/390334.html\">View note</a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7660313.gif\" height=\"1\">",

      "summary": {
        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jesse-eisinger\">Jesse Eisinger</a> </p>\n<p>After Hurricane Irma hit three months ago in Orlando, Florida, the local police <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/weather/hurricane/os-hurricane-irma-carbon-monoxide-deaths-20170913-story.html\">got a desperate 911 call</a> from a 12-year-old boy reporting that his mother and siblings were unconscious. Fumes overcame the first deputy who rushed to the scene. After the police arrived at the property, they found Jan Lebron Diaz, age 13, Jan’s older sister Kiara, 16, and their mother Desiree, 34, lying dead, poisoned from carbon monoxide emitted by their portable generator. Four others in the house went to the hospital. If 12-year-old Louis hadn’t made that call, they might have died, too.</p>\n<p>Portable generators release more carbon monoxide — which is particularly dangerous because it is odorless and invisible — than most cars. As a result, the devices can kill efficiently and quickly, though accidentally. The Diaz family usually placed the generator properly, outside the house, a neighbor told local reporters. But for some reason, they had brought it into their garage. From there, the generator’s murderous byproduct spread silently through the house.</p>\n<p>During hurricanes, floods, and nor’easters, portable generators save lives — except when they take them. Irma, Harvey, and Maria all left thousands without power and reliant on their portable generators. The government has not yet done its official count, but 11 people using these generators died just from Irma, according to preliminary government estimates. Many more died from Harvey and Maria, experts say, especially in Puerto Rico, which has been without a functioning power grid for months.</p>\n<p>These deaths rarely merit more than short stories on local news sites. Civil servants then accumulate the statistics into dry reports that end up buried somewhere on .gov websites. The latest of these shows that portable generators have killed on average 70 people a year since 2005. That’s a small fraction of the toll from car accidents. Still, generators rank as one of the deadliest consumer products on the market. A further 2,800 people a year suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the equipment.</p>\n<p>Portable generator deaths are preventable, and for the past 16-plus years, the United States government has tried to do just that. The job has fallen to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which, with its $126 million budget and 520 employees, oversees almost every product Americans use in their home, office, or out in the yard, save for food, drugs, and cars. The CPSC, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is tiny, especially compared to many of the corporations it regulates, and hamstrung by Congressional rules that require it to seek voluntary standards before attempting to impose mandatory ones.</p>\n<p>But the problem of portable generators was so obvious that the little agency felt it needed to make a stand. They were one of the “persistent deadly hazards we felt we had to address,” says Elliot Kaye, who was the chairman of the CPSC from 2014 to February of this year and remains a commissioner. (The CPSC has five commissioners who vote on agency measures; the party that controls the White House tends to have the majority.)</p>\n<p>Throughout the 16 years the CPSC has been pushing the issue, the portable-generator industry fended off regulations that would have required it to reduce the carbon monoxide emissions of its devices. The companies argued such changes would be too costly, and that they lacked the technology to make the machines safer. The industry lobbied hard, and also wielded an arsenal of delaying measures and misdirection, not to mention occasional strong-arm tactics to enforce industry discipline, its critics say.</p>\n<p>But in early November 2016, during the final months of the Obama administration, the CPSC took one of the most significant steps it can take: The commission voted in favor of a rule to force manufacturers to lower their generators’ carbon monoxide emissions. The vote was 4 to 1, with one Republican joining the majority of Democrats.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump was elected a week later. In January, he elevated the only commissioner to vote against the rule — Ann Marie Buerkle, a 66-year-old former Republican congresswoman from upstate New York — to be the acting chair of the CPSC, and she took on the role in February. (She awaits Senate confirmation to become the chair.) The administration has nominated, as a potential commissioner, a lawyer from the corporate firm Jones Day who specializes in defending companies from product-liability cases; one other vacancy remains. So Buerkle will likely soon have new allies.</p>\n<p>Self-effacing and warm, Buerkle wins universal praise from agency employees and fellow commissioners as a pleasant colleague. Even the Democratic appointees feel she listens to them. Indeed, the CPSC took pride that it wasn’t riven by the partisan rancor that infects so much of Washington. Kaye, a Democrat, brought his family to visit fellow commissioner Buerkle and her family when they vacationed in upstate New York.</p>\n<p>Buerkle’s gentle personality, however, belies hardline views on regulation. Buerkle has never, in her fellow commissioners’ recollection, advocated for the agency to regulate a product that the CPSC staff thinks is unsafe. She is a government regulator who doesn’t appear to believe in government regulation.</p>\n<p>Voluntary standards are “a better way to go,” Buerkle told ProPublica. “They are quick to complete. There’s much more efficiency in implementation. And there’s much more buy-in from stakeholders.” Never mind that in this instance it took more than a decade, and ongoing government prodding, for companies to get close to adopting a voluntary standard of its own. Pressed on which product hazards are her priorities, Buerkle says: “Fidget spinners are a big deal.” (They should not be <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Fidget-Spinners-Safety-Information-Center\">placed in the mouth</a>, the commission warns.) She also mentions children’s products and toys, pool safety, and portable generators.</p>\n<p>Among her first actions as chair, Buerkle did two things. She sent a letter in August to Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, agreeing with his assertion that the CPSC does not have the legal authority to make a rule about carbon monoxide emissions from portable generators.</p>\n<p>In a second move, Buerkle appointed Patricia Hanz to be her general counsel. Hanz comes from Briggs &amp; Stratton, a manufacturer of engines in Wauwautosa, Wisconsin, where she was the assistant general counsel. Briggs &amp; Stratton, which brings in $1.8 billion a year, happens to be one of the biggest portable-generator manufacturers in the world. Hanz also served as the vice president of the portable-generator trade group.</p>\n<p>The rise of Hanz and Buerkle — and the issue of portable generators — has injected a new contentiousness into the CPSC. In an <a href=\"https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/Video/commission-meeting-decisional-matter-fiscal-year-2018-operating-plan\">impassioned speech in October</a>, decrying the future of her agency, CPSC commissioner Marietta Robinson called Hanz “the one person who fought the hardest against any safety measures” for portable generators.</p>\n<p>Hanz declined to comment on a detailed list of questions. In a statement from the CPSC’s public-affairs office attributed to Hanz, she said she has recused herself. “Under the Trump Administration Ethics Pledge I cannot have any involvement with my former employer, nor with PGMA (Portable Generator Manufacturers Association) for two years, including contracts and regulations. In addition, to avoid any appearance of partiality, I will have no involvement in matters related to any PGMA members,” she wrote in an email. Briggs &amp; Stratton also declined to respond to detailed questions. The company said in a statement it “is and has always been committed to safe operation of generators.”</p>\n<p>While Trump has achieved few of his legislative priorities, his administration is succeeding in broadly eroding federal regulation. Having fought the long war, the portable generator industry is now poised to benefit from the president’s success. The government’s portable-generator rule has not been finalized — and now with Buerkle at the helm, it probably will never be.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Consumer Products Safety Commission’s efforts to fix portable generators owe their origins to what now seems like a silly panic just before the turn of the century. In the lead-up to the year 2000, people worried that computers wouldn’t be able to process, in their databases, the transition from the year 1999, a theoretical calamity referred to as the Y2K problem. If they went on the fritz, some predicted, the country might face catastrophes like mass blackouts. Regulators worried that people would rush out to buy portable generators, leading to a spike in carbon monoxide deaths.</p>\n<p>Y2K passed without incident, and those who purchased generators to protect against the apocalypse sheepishly stored them away unused. But the CPSC realized that it should do something about needless carbon monoxide deaths. Portable generators were killing more people than all heating systems combined.</p>\n<p>When the CPSC thinks about regulating products, it considers what it calls a “safety hierarchy.” The best solution is to design a product that is safe. Not all products, of course, can be perfectly safe — cars must go fast and table saws must be sharp. So the second-best remedy in the hierarchy is to mitigate the risk with, say, airbags or hand-guards. The third option is a warning label, but the CPSC staff typically views that as least desirable because people often don’t abide by the warnings.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the commission contacted Underwriters Laboratories, a private company that tests product safety and helps develop industry standards, to see if it would help companies make safer generators. Seeing the government moving, the manufacturers began, with reluctance, to place warning labels on the machines. At the time, the companies claimed, a label that cautioned people not to operate the machines indoors was as far as they were able to go: The technology, they asserted, did not exist to make a generator engine that emitted less carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p>The CPSC staff was happy enough at the time because third-best is better than nothing. Still, in the case of portable generators, the instructions can produce confusion. They tell consumers not to operate them indoors, but also not to let the machines get wet, which would seem to rule out placing them outside in many cases. Given that people tend to use their generators precisely when weather conditions are snowy or torrential, this is hard advice to follow. Some users solve this conundrum by doing things like putting the generator on their porch or in their garage. Sometimes people have not put their generators far enough outside: More than a quarter of portable generator deaths occur from these sorts of placements.</p>\n<p>The companies were not sympathetic, says CPSC commissioner Kaye. His impression of the industry view was: “If consumers are too stupid to read the label and they die, that’s their fault.”</p>\n<p>In the short term, adopting the labels had one positive effect — at least for the manufacturers: It staved off stricter regulation for several years. Unfortunately, it was a different matter for consumers. The labels had no apparent effect. The number of carbon monoxide deaths and injuries caused by generators did not decline.</p>\n<p>The continuing deaths were disturbing enough that in 2006, under the George W. Bush administration — no fan of regulation — the CPSC decided to take more significant steps. The CPSC b<a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-approves-anpr-to-make-portable-generators-saferrulemaking-aims-to-address-rising-death\">egan work on a mandatory rule</a> requiring manufacturers to make their machines safer. How the industry got there would be up to them. Companies could develop engines with lower emissions or install switches that automatically shut off the engine when carbon monoxide levels got too high. The agency produced what it calls an “Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” announcing its intentions and allowing the public to comment.</p>\n<p>Comments flowed in, especially from the industry. In February 2007, manufacturers wrote to the CPSC urging it not to impose a mandatory standard. They said it would be costly. They also raised questions of whether the CPSC even had the power to require engines with low emissions. As for shut-off switches, the companies warned that “the presence of such [carbon monoxide] detections capability may create a false sense of security,” lulling consumers into thinking they don’t need to take other precautions. One of the three signatories was Patricia Hanz, then working for Briggs &amp; Stratton.</p>\n<p>But with the warning label clearly no longer placating the government, the industry gave some ground, agreeing to begin developing its own voluntary standard in the hopes of avoiding a stricter mandatory standard from the government.</p>\n<p>For the next three years, little happened. Underwriters Laboratories, today known as UL, again tried to help the industry come up with its voluntary standard, but in 2009, as UL worked toward guidelines manufacturers considered too stringent, they decided to go their own way.</p>\n<p>The companies created their own trade group, the Portable Generator Manufacturers Association. The PGMA launched its own initiative to create a voluntary standard. But the CPSC remained skeptical. One problem was that the PGMA’s members don’t sell all the generators purchased in the U.S. Other makers wouldn’t be bound by anything that body came up with. (Today, the PGMA says it represents 80 percent of the market, which manufacturers I spoke to estimate to be anywhere from $700 million to $1 billion.)</p>\n<p>The following year — a decade after the CPSC began trying to prevent deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning — the PGMA held its first technical committee meeting to discuss the safety of portable generators. Among the attendees was Michael Gardner, the vice president of new product development at Techtronic Industries, a maker of generators and other products (including Hoover and Dirt Devil vacuum cleaners). He waited for a discussion of carbon monoxide emissions. And waited.</p>\n<p>Nobody ever brought them up. “The one topic the technical committee was not talking about — the elephant in the room — was the roughly 70 people dying [each year],” Gardner says. “The technical committee was established to write the safety standard but it did not include carbon monoxide in that standard.”</p>\n<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is far and away the chief safety concern from portable generators. Nothing else comes close. But Hanz, then on the PGMA board of directors, argued that the industry should figure out all the easy things first, rather than tackle the most contentious issues right away.</p>\n<p>With the voluntary standard going nowhere, the CPSC decided it needed to conduct the manufacturers’ research and development for them. It sent out a proposal asking for engineers to try to solve the problem. The University of Alabama answered, and came up with a prototype for a safer generator. In October 2012, the CPSC gave a technology demonstration to the industry showing the new engine could lower emissions by more than 90 percent.</p>\n<p>Many of the companies scoffed. They argued the prototype was unproven and unreliable, and that the University of Alabama results were obtained in unrealistic conditions. They even suggested the new engine might be dangerous, giving users the sense that they needn’t worry. One company, however, embraced the new ideas: Techtronic. “That was a tipping point for us to say it can be done,” Gardner says.</p>\n<p>Not until September 2014 did the PGMA <a href=\"http://www.pgmaonline.com/pdf/SafetyStandard.pdf\">release an initial voluntary technical safety standard</a> for manufacturers. The detailed list included provisions for durability (generators had to survive being dropped from a height of eight inches onto a concrete surface); temperature tolerance (wind speed less than 6.7 miles per hour during testing), and rain resistance (a generator must be soaked, wiped off, and then run for 15 minutes).</p>\n<p>But the standard was mute about the emissions that could kill customers. The CPSC sent a politely worded letter in January 2015 that the “staff notes with concern” that the proposal’s only mention of carbon monoxide was in the context of warning labels and external carbon monoxide monitors. On average in the three years through 2012 (the most recent year for which official data is publicly available — the government’s death-count lags as the tally only becomes official years later), carbon monoxide from portable generators killed 63 people per year. The CPSC’s displeasure carried a threat to the industry: If it didn’t get moving, the commission would move forward on its own mandatory standards effort.</p>\n<p>To confront this threat, the industry countered with one of its own. In March 2014, the PGMA sent a letter to the commission insisting that it was “not appropriate” for the CPSC “to establish a working group” on the issue, statements that carried the implication it might sue the government if the commission tried to implement a mandatory rule. At that point, the PGMA finally formed two groups of its own to examine two engineering solutions: a low-emissions engine based on the University of Alabama prototype and an automatic shut-off valve. Most of the manufacturers, if pressed, preferred adding shut-off valves; they’re much cheaper. After two meetings, the PGMA picked that option and discontinued the group aimed at looking at lowering emissions.</p>\n<p>A year later, the PGMA was ready to show off its progress. In March 2016, the trade group hosted a technical summit. Representatives from manufacturers flew in from all over the country. But only one PGMA member made a presentation regarding a new low-emission generator: Techtronic’s Gardner. In front of a crowd that included manufacturing employees, lobbyists, CPSC staff, and one CPSC commissioner, Republican appointee Joseph Mohorovic, Gardner demonstrated that the low-emissions technology worked. Techtronic’s engine produced 90 percent less carbon monoxide than a similar machine.</p>\n<p>When Gardner finished, he looked around the room and heard nothing but silence. Then, in a scene out of “Citizen Kane,” he heard one lone person begin to clap: Mohorovic. After the talk, the commissioner stood up, came over, and shook Gardner’s hand.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, someone asked whether companies were going to introduce a low-emissions engine, and if so when. Briggs &amp; Stratton’s Hanz said it would be many years, perhaps five or six. Not so, Techtronic said. It was planning to introduce one in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Finally, in October of last year the time had come. American society makes bargains with its machines. The country is willing to pay, sometimes in lives, for less expensive and more convenient products. But this deal seemed, to the government, too costly.</p>\n<p>To make any rule, the CPSC is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. In this case, the commission estimated that new portable generator restrictions would save $145 million annually, accounting for the government-computed value of the lives saved. (The industry took issue with those figures.) The commission rarely votes on mandatory rules. Indeed, Congress requires the agency to try to get industries to implement voluntary standards first. But the portable generator makers had not done so.</p>\n<p>The commissioners concluded they had no choice. They voted on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR), a big — but not final — step toward a mandatory rule. It required manufacturers to build low-emissions machines. The CPSC staff said it was the best alternative. After investigating four different shut-off technologies, they determined that option was “not feasible.” With Mohorovic joining the Democrats, the vote was 4 to 1.</p>\n<p>“Our staff engineers spent well over a decade trying to get manufacturers to make portable generators safer and all but a couple steadfastly refused to do so,” says Marietta Robinson, a commissioner appointed by President Obama. “This NPR was absolutely essential in forcing manufacturers to do the right thing to save lives.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the manufacturers were still dithering on a voluntary standard. They couldn’t even agree on how to measure how much carbon monoxide their engines emitted. In April of this year, UL tried to take a preliminary step; it proposed a uniform method for measuring emissions. Techtronic lobbied for it. Briggs &amp; Stratton pushed against it. Things got heated: At one point, a Briggs &amp; Stratton employee labeled Techtronic a “rogue company” in an email circulated to PGMA members. During the voting, some manufacturers changed their position, from being for the standard to being against. Briggs won and the measure was narrowly defeated.</p>\n<p>Today, with Buerkle as chair, the fate of the mandatory standard seems doomed. She has already voted against it once, and stated that the CPSC has no power to regulate generators’ carbon monoxide emissions. Installing Hanz as general counsel has only made some CPSC officials more pessimistic about regulating portable generators. Buerkle says Hanz is qualified and that her appointment was fully vetted by ethics officials.</p>\n<p>Nearly two decades after carbon monoxide concerns first arose, the industry says it is close to a voluntary standard. Even this move has twists and turns. PGMA is working on a less stringent guideline, only requiring a shutoff sensor. It is aiming to have it completed by this year.</p>\n<p>At the same time, UL circulated a competing, stricter measure, requiring both a shutoff sensor and a low-emission engine. Again, members lobbied intensely. The nay votes had a surprising supporter: Mohorovic. The Republican commissioner has left the CPSC and taken a job at the law firm Dentons. And he has flipped from the position he held as a public servant. He now is against a low-emissions engine, sending a series of emails attacking UL’s standard and urging members to vote against. “There is no evidence, data or modeling” that UL’s standard will save lives, he wrote recently in an email to one voter. (He did not respond to questions about why or who his client was.)</p>\n<p>Buerkle, too, advocates for a shutoff sensor. She contends they are the safer alternative. “I’m told by CPSC staff,” she says, that “shutoff technology will be far more effective” in saving lives. She says the staff told her that shutoff switches would reduce the figure by somewhere around 99 percent.</p>\n<p>But in fact that 99 percent figure is an industry estimate. The CPSC acknowledges that it has neither calculated how many deaths the shutoff valves will save, nor concluded that they’re more effective at saving lives than low-emission technology. The staff at the commission has worried that carbon monoxide can migrate away from a machine such that it kills without ever triggering the shutoff switches. And staffers worry that the switches might trigger bothersome shut-offs, leading consumers to disable the switches. The industry says it has resolved those concerns, but Techtronic takes issue with the figure. Calling PGMA’s 99 percent claim “misleading,” the company says it has not been peer-reviewed and doesn’t account for many scenarios when portable generators are used.</p>\n<p>Buerkle is satisfied with the industry’s progress: “I’m just happy where we are right now. We are on the verge with technology that will save lives.”</p>\n<p>Others at the CPSC remain skeptical. “I am extremely concerned that backing off now, as our chair and general counsel have made clear they intend to do, will, at a minimum, delay these life-saving efforts and, perhaps stop them altogether,” says Robinson, the Democratic commissioner whose term has expired. (She will leave when her replacement is confirmed.) But with Buerkle’s ascendancy, there’s not much Democratic commissioners can do.</p>\n<p>The industry says some manufacturers aim to start marketing machines with shutoff switches next year. “This should be a good news story that industry stepped up to do the right thing,” says Edward Krenik, a lobbyist who represents the PGMA. “Though it took a while.”</p>\n<p>For its part, Techtronic kept its promise to put a low-emissions generator on the market. They’re available now — and they sell for less than many other competing products. But to the industry, that makes Techtronic an outcast.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7657990.gif\" height=\"1\">",

And for every death, dozens of women suffer life-threatening complications. But there is a stark racial disparity in these numbers. Black mothers are three to four times more likely to die than white mothers. Nevertheless, black women’s voices are often missing from public discussions about what’s behind the maternal health crisis and how to address the problems.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that up to 60 percent of maternal complications are preventable. One way to prevent them is to talk to and learn from women who have nearly died from these complications. So, we reached out to nearly 200 black mothers or families that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-and-npr-investigate-maternal-mortality\">shared stories</a> of severe complications as part of our maternal health investigation <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/lost-mothers\">Lost Mothers</a>.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Maternal Complications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/9499/7657991#postpartum-hemorrhage\">Postpartum Hemorrhage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/9499/7657991#fibroids-preeclampsia\">Fibroids and Preeclampsia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/9499/7657991#uterine-rupture\">Uterine Rupture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/9499/7657991#SCAD\">Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/9499/7657991#peripartum-cardiomyopathy\">Peripartum Cardiomyopathy</a></li>\n</ul>\n</aside>\n<p>Since this disparity has existed for decades, we were interested in learning how it might have affected generations of black women — and maybe even women in the same families.</p>\n<p>We also know difficult conversations can sometimes be easier with a loved one. We asked women if they would be willing to discuss their near miss with their mother or daughter.</p>\n<p>To help navigate these tough conversations, we gave each pair of women a tailored set of questions and got out of the way (you can download a copy of the questions <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InzPo9-JSd8bdvFrh0EsQ-sghcf4BnWcl8h6RJVWoE4/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>). We spent an hour recording them, some in their living rooms and others over the phone. We’ve organized these conversations by the complications each woman faced. We included several generations of women from 6 to 64 years old.</p>\n<h3>Postpartum Hemorrhage</h3>\n<p><em>A postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) occurs when a woman experiences heavy blood loss after giving birth. In developed countries, pregnant women nearly die from this complication more than any other. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, which means the uterus isn't contracting effectively after delivery. However, having fibroids (benign tumors in the uterus), any kind of infection or a systemic blood clotting disorder can also cause PPH.</em></p>\n<figure>\n<h3>Heather and Avis</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-avis.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-avis.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-avis.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-avis.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Avis Glover was integral in the recovery of her daughter Heather Dobbs, who nearly died due to a hemorrhage in 2017. <span>(Joanie Tobin for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Heather Dobbs was 41 weeks pregnant when she went into a prolonged labor. Eventually she was induced and had an emergency cesarean section at a hospital near her home at the time in rural Texas. Dobbs, 37, an educator and editor now living in Covington, Georgia, says there were no further complications. After the C-section, both Dobbs and her new son Cameron were fine and went home.</p>\n<p>Two years later, in 2016, Dobbs was pregnant again. Because of her emergency C-section with Cameron, she was scheduled for another C-section and could plan the birth of her second child. She picked Feb. 8. It was two days before her own birthday. Dobbs was excited and felt prepared to welcome her first daughter, Claire, into the world.</p>\n<p>Then came the uterine atony. During her C-section, her doctors said her uterus was “boggy” — it was soft, enlarged, floppy and would not contract as it was supposed to. It also wouldn’t stop bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Heather:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"18000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/HD1.mp3\">Listen</span> They were just bringing fluid after fluid, after fluid bag, and I finally said to myself: You cannot die on this table before you get to hold your daughter. And that’s the last thing I remember. </p>\n<p>Claire was born healthy. But Dobbs’ postpartum hemorrhaging — as a result of uterine atony — forced the doctors to perform a full hysterectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Heather:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"20000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/HD2.mp3\">Listen</span> And then, the doctor came in to talk about the hysterectomy with me. And, I just remember ... you know how you watched Charlie Brown, and it's like, womp womp womp womp womp womp. It's like, what is she saying? I knew it was serious, but they had to eventually call her back in to re-explain. “You were bleeding out. You lost a tremendous amount of blood, and you had to ... We had to take your uterus.” </p>\n<p>The emotional toll of the hysterectomy and the complication that caused it led to postpartum depression. The support of her mother — Avis Glover, 63, a career nurse, who had two C-sections herself — has been important in her recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Avis</strong>: How do you manage, you think, with the long-term effects of your experience?</p>\n<p><strong>Heather</strong>: <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"27000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/HD3.mp3\">Listen</span> At my darkest hour, it was like why plan anything?

And in caring for them, you must care for yourself, so you can’t have the anxious mom, and the depressed mom, you have to treat it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-and-npr-investigate-maternal-mortality\"><em>Did you suffer postpartum hemorrhage?

Fibroids, however, are three times more likely to occur in black women than white women. They also tend to occur at younger ages and grow more quickly in black women, causing more severe symptoms — like heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain — contributing to complications such as postpartum hemorrhage.</em></p>\n<p><em>Preeclampsia occurs when a woman with normal blood pressure develops high blood pressure during pregnancy and when protein is found in the urine. Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to other serious complications for both the mother and the baby. Preeclampsia affects at least 5 to 8 percent of pregnancies. When black women have preeclampsia, it presents earlier than in women of other races.</em></p>\n<figure>\n<h3>Wanda and Asha</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-wanda-asha.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171208-black-maternal-health-wanda-asha.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171208-black-maternal-health-wanda-asha.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-wanda-asha.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Asha Ivey-Stephenson and Wanda Irving became friends in 2002 through Wanda’s daughter, Shalon Irving. <span>(Joanie Tobin for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Asha Ivey-Stephenson, 37, and Wanda Irving, 64, became friends through Wanda’s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth\">Shalon Irving</a>. The three first met in Michigan in 2002 while Asha and Shalon visited graduate school programs they were interested in attending. Years later the friends reconnected in the Atlanta area where they both settled. Close in age, both wanted to become mothers. Ivey-Stephenson would be the first. She got pregnant in 2015 when she was 35 years old. Ivey-Stephenson has fibroids, a complication that affects 80 percent of black women. No one knows what exactly causes fibroids or why black women are so susceptible.</p>\n<p>Ivey-Stephenson’s fibroids kept her in the high risk perinatal unit for a month and a half. Her stay was so long that Ivey-Stephenson had her baby shower at the hospital. In mid-December she delivered a healthy baby boy.</p>\n<p><strong>Asha:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"34000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/AIS1.mp3\">Listen</span> This is something that Shalon and I actually bonded over. She helped motivate me through as well. My challenges that I was referring to primarily stemmed from my uterine fibroids and it’s something that African-American women deal with. The majority of my friends have, whether it’s small, large, multiple fibroids. It’s something that my mother had, so I knew that most likely I’d have it.</p>\n<p>Five days after she delivered, just as she was about to leave the hospital, Ivey-Stephenson’s blood pressure skyrocketed.</p>\n<p><strong>Asha:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"39000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/AIS2.mp3\">Listen</span> There were points where [my blood pressure] got so high, we were all not sure what was going to happen. When I got home, I had to have physical therapy, occupational therapy and regular nursing. Occupational therapy and regular nursing came to the house because I had lost so much muscle tone. Basically I couldn't walk. So I had to learn all that over again. And it was just, trying to do that plus trying to breastfeed, trying to do all these different things was challenging.</p>\n<p>During all of this, Irving was part of her network of supportive friends.</p>\n<p>A little over a year later, in January 2017, Irving celebrated the birth of her first child — a baby girl she named Soleil. But Irving was a mother for just three weeks. Her postpartum complications became increasingly serious. She ultimately died due to complications from high blood pressure. Soleil was left in the care of Irving’s mother, Wanda. Ivy-Stephenson has stayed close to the family. Wanda sat down with Ivey-Stephenson to share this conversation, and her advice for other expectant black women.</p>\n<p><strong>Wanda:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"41000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/WI1.mp3\">Listen</span> My one regret is that Shalon told me once, she says, “I know my body. I know there’s something wrong,” and that’s what I would recommend to every black woman, if you know there’s something wrong, please don’t stop until you find someone who will help you figure out what’s wrong, and not just take a lot of the paternalistic kinds of answers or the general answers, “Oh well it’s nothing. It comes along with pregnancy,” or “It's part of childbirth,” or it’s part of whatever. You know your body better than anyone else. You live in that body.

Tell us.</em></a></p>\n<h3>Uterine Rupture</h3>\n<p><em>A uterine rupture is a tear in the wall of the uterus. While rare, this complication is dangerous not just for the mother but for the child. When the uterus tears, the unborn baby can be expelled into his or her mother’s abdomen. The baby can be deprived of oxygen and the mother can experience severe blood loss. A well-known risk factor for a uterine rupture is a uterine scar. Most uterine scars arise from a prior cesarean delivery</em>.</p>\n<figure>\n<h3>Brenda and Heather</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-brenda.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-brenda.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-brenda.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-heather-brenda.jpg\">\n<figcaption>During a family visit to Durango, Colorado, Heather Lavender and her mother, Brenda Bagby, recorded this conversation.\n<span>(Courtesy of Heather Lavender)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In March 2014, Heather Lavender was 32 and nine months pregnant when she went into labor. Her mother, Brenda Bagby, her sister, Melissa, her doula, and her son’s father rushed Lavender to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore where she was also an intensive care nurse.</p>\n<p>After many hours of labor, she had a pain in her abdomen, which gradually became unbearable. That pain turned out to be a uterine rupture. After an emergency C-section to deliver the baby, doctors had to perform a hysterectomy to stop the massive blood loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Heather:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"16000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/HL1.mp3\">Listen</span> You know as long as my baby is OK, you know ... God can’t be that cruel to have me lose my uterus and my baby all at the same time. So at that point I was just really hoping and praying that my son would be OK.</p>\n<p>The rupture, however, was catastrophic for her son. Cruz ended up outside of the womb and without oxygen. As a result, he suffered severe brain damage. When Cruz was born he never moved, opened his eyes or cried.</p>\n<p><strong>Brenda:</strong> How are you different now than before your complication?</p>\n<p><strong>Heather:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"37000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/HL2.mp3\">Listen</span> I think for most of my life I’ve been a pretty positive person and I just don’t feel that way about myself anymore. I feel purposeless, I don’t feel that I have like true joy in my life, I don’t care. I pray for an early death. I don’t want to live to be an old person ... and I know it’s wrong.</p>\n<p>Cruz lived nine days on a ventilator in the neonatal intensive care unit before Lavender and her family decided to remove him from life support.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-lavendar9.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171208-black-maternal-health-lavendar9.jpg 800w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171208-black-maternal-health-lavendar9.jpg\">\n<figcaption>When Cruz was born he never moved, opened his eyes or cried.

I just wanted it to stop, I didn’t want to hear more beeping. No more alarms. So I am glad we got to have a little bit of time without all of that. And when they extubated him, when they removed him from the breathing tube it was clear that he wasn’t going to be able to be with us for very long. So being able to go home and have that quiet time with him that we wouldn’t have had otherwise was really a blessing and having the pictures that we have from that helps me every day.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Lavender moved from Baltimore, Maryland, to Farmington, New Mexico.

It’s when a tear forms in one of the blood vessels in the heart. It can slow or block blood flow, causing a heart attack, abnormalities in heart rhythm or sudden death.

She was 30 at the time. She did not have a heart condition or a previous history of hypertension. But five days after giving birth to her first child, Aniston, in 2011, she nearly died.</p>\n<p>Aniston is now 6 years old and wanted to ask her mother this:</p>\n<p><strong>Aniston:</strong> How did you get your heart attack?</p>\n<p><strong>Candice:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"37000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/CW1.mp3\">Listen</span> That’s a good question baby, doctors aren’t really sure. I've seen at least four doctors related to the heart attack and all they can tell me is that it is a rare occurrence and that it has something to do with my hormones so when I had you my hormones were unstable as women’s hormones are after they give birth so I guess that caused my heart to start hurting baby but it wasn’t your fault.</p>\n<p>Williams, now 37, was home from the hospital when her chest started to hurt. The pain got so bad that her mother, LaVerne Maynard, rushed Williams to a nearby hospital in El Centro, California. Because that hospital wasn’t equipped to treat Williams, she was airlifted more than 100 miles to a hospital in San Diego.</p>\n<p><strong>LaVerne</strong>: What is the hardest moment for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Candice:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"37000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/CW2.mp3\">Listen</span> The hardest moment was probably being life-flighted and I only remember parts of it, I guess I was really scared and I kept thinking about Ani and if I ... if something happened to me, I had no idea what was going to happen to my baby. So that was the hardest moment. It’s still the hardest moment.</p>\n<p>After more tests, doctors concluded that she had experienced a SCAD. Rather than operate on her, they gave her blood thinners, beta blockers and aspirin to prevent another attack and help heal the heart on its own. She was hospitalized for four days and released.</p>\n<p><strong>Candice:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"37000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/CW3.mp3\">Listen</span> I had a relatively good diet, I was not overweight and SCAD often happens to women who don't have any prior health issues. So people think because I had a heart attack that I had high blood pressure or I didn't eat right or didn't exercise but I was actually the opposite of that.</p>\n<p>After surviving this SCAD, her doctors advised against a second pregnancy. But, five years later, in March of 2016, Williams gave birth to a second daughter, Leah. This time, she had no complications. Williams pays more attention to her body now. She takes blood pressure medication once a week, sees her cardiologists every six months, exercises, and watches what she eats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-and-npr-investigate-maternal-mortality\"><em>Did you suffer a SCAD?

It’s when the heart isn’t strong enough to pump enough blood to the vital organs so they can function properly. A mother may experience PPCM up to six months postpartum. On average, PPCM affects black women at a younger age (27.6 years old) than non-black women (31.7 years old).

She said she was told to eat some beets to improve a low iron count. Two days later, Porter nearly died. Her heart failed to pump enough blood to keep her vital organs going. This is called postpartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM).</p>\n<p>That was the first time Porter had heard of PPCM — from an emergency room doctor diagnosing it as her organs started to shut down.

Twenty-eight days later I still found it extremely difficult to function. I was extremely fatigued. Was constantly experiencing shortness of breath. Coughing all the time unable to lie down, heart palpitations, I had significant weight gain, excessive swelling in my legs, belly, feet, ankles. I remember each day became unbearable and each night became a nightmare. At that point I knew something was wrong with my body.</p>\n<p>In the years since the cardiomyopathy, she has needed two separate heart procedures: a defibrillator implanted in 2010, and open-heart surgery after a silent heart attack in 2012.</p>\n<p><strong>Anner:</strong> Do you look at your own life differently?</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"37000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/J1.mp3\">Listen</span> Yes, I do. Seeing how something simple can — like childbirth — put so much stress on your body and seeing everything that you went through in terms of how you drastically had to change your diet, how you were going from no medication to five to six different medications, how your body reacted. Seeing how different stress in certain activities in life you couldn’t do in terms of like walking up the stairs, you couldn’t do. How little things like driving, you used to lose your breath and you used to have that plastic bag … not plastic … paper bag in your purse in case something happened, you had that, so yeah it has changed my life.</p>\n<p>While the cause of PPCM remains unknown, Porter believes awareness among women and clinicians can save lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Anner:</strong> <span data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"37000\" data-plays=\"1\" data-url=\"https://assets.propublica.org/audio/20171208-maternal-audio/AP2.mp3\">Listen</span> I don’t want any other woman to experience a near-death pregnancy like I did, I feel that I must continue to bring awareness about this deadly disease that actually has no cure in sight.</p>\n<p>To raise awareness, Porter founded the nonprofit organization <a href=\"http://www.fightppcm.org/\">Fight Against Peripartum and Postpartum Cardiomyopathy</a>.

ProPublica will reimburse the newsrooms for salary for the selected reporters and provide extensive support and guidance for their stories.</p>\n<p>Winners were selected from a pool of 239 applications from 45 states, plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The projects selected by editors should surprise and probe deeply, with the potential to spur positive change. Topics covered, among others, will include conflicts of interest, housing, mental health care, criminal justice and workplace safety. The selected newsrooms and reporters are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Advocate (Baton Rouge, La.) — Rebekah Allen</li>\n<li>Charleston Gazette-Mail (Charleston, W. Va.) — Ken Ward, Jr.</li>\n<li>Malheur Enterprise (Vale, Ore.) — Jayme Fraser</li>\n<li>Santa Fe New Mexican (Santa Fe, N.M.) — Rebecca Moss</li>\n<li>South Bend Tribune (South Bend, Ind.) — Christian Sheckler</li>\n<li>The Southern Illinoisan (Carbondale, Ill.) — Molly Parker</li>\n<li>WMFE (Orlando, Fla.) — Abe Aboraya</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Participants in the ProPublica Local Reporting Network will work in and report to their home newsrooms while collaborating with ProPublica senior editor Charles Ornstein. ProPublica's expertise with data, research and engagement will be available for their stories as well. The stories will be jointly published by their news organizations and ProPublica.</p>\n<p>“This project was started to give local newsrooms across America needed resources and support to execute investigative journalism that digs deep and holds power to account,” Ornstein said. “The powerful proposals from our inaugural group of reporters are very much in that spirit, and I look forward to working with them to help bring their stories to fruition over the next year.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7657992.gif\" height=\"1\">",

I’d use these terms in meetings with my editors, and I could feel my own eyelids getting heavy.</p>\n<p>For about 2 1/2 years now, I’ve been reporting on the Cook County property tax assessment system, uncovering inequities and explaining them to readers. At times, the work has been mind-numbing, with long stretches when I was lost in the weeds. But one thing was certain: Behind all the technical terms and the statistics was a story about the simple concept of fairness.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the assessor’s office is a black box. Not even attorneys who have worked in the field for decades understand how the office derives values. And Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios has refused to make that information public. My work, to some degree, involves poking holes in the box so we can shed light on how the office operates. My story this week on <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/the-tax-divide/cook-county-commercial-and-industrial-property-tax-assessments/\">commercial and industrial assessments</a> is the latest, following work I did on <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/\">residential assessments</a> for the Chicago Tribune.</p>\n<p>In the early days of reporting these stories, I found Illinois Department of Revenue studies that suggested the property tax assessment system was deeply unfair. I wanted to determine if the evidence supported that assertion and proved the system was broken. As my reporting — and my work with colleague Sandhya Kambhampati — progressed and I learned more, I began to see how those with the least were paying more than they should while the wealthy paid less.</p>\n<p>At a time when income inequality has grown to staggering proportions in our country, I came to see that the property tax system aggravated those disparities. Many of those who benefited were political heavyweights who also work as property tax lawyers.</p>\n<p>How could I present this information in a way that would move readers and, perhaps, drive change? I knew the key was getting <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/the-tax-divide-analysis\">behind the numbers</a> and finding the people who were harmed by the system. Their compelling stories fueled the narrative as we presented the nuts and bolts of this arcane system and our investigative findings about it.</p>\n<p>I found people like Brenda Doyle, owner of Sweet Pea Academy day care, in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on the South Side. She ran the day care with her husband, Larry, and daughter Jamilah. Sweet Pea is exactly the kind of small, family-owned business that should get a fair shake. Instead, its tax bill was far higher than it should have been, which made it hard for the family to stay afloat. The story about the Doyles’ business was similar to ones I discovered when reporting on <a href=\"http://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/appeals.html\">residential assessments</a> for the Chicago Tribune. For that project, I found a block in North Lawndale where nearly every property was overvalued. Many of the people I met grew up in their homes, having inherited them from their parents, and now are having trouble paying their property taxes because they were overvalued. People like Joan Clark, who struggled to pay the property tax bill on the home she grew up in because it was overvalued by 40 percent. She told me she was worried about losing her house.</p>\n<p>These are the people who matter. They are why we worked so hard to shine a light on this issue.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7657782.gif\" height=\"1\">",

With support from a new three-year grant, we’re covering the salary and benefits of a reporter at each of these news organizations. The reporters will spend next year working on an investigative project in their home newsrooms and they will receive extensive guidance and support from ProPublica. Their work will be co-published by their home newsroom and by ProPublica.</p>\n<p>They were selected from a pool of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-local-reporting-network-responses\">239 applications</a> and will cover a diverse array of topics, including conflicts of interest, housing, workplace safety, mental health and criminal justice.</p>\n<p>The other reporters and newsrooms chosen to take part in the reporting network include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Abe Aboraya, a health reporter at WMFE, an NPR affiliate in Orlando. Aboraya has covered the deadly shooting at the Pulse nightclub and produced an <a href=\"http://www.wmfe.org/chaos-in-the-er-how-mass-shootings-flood-trauma-centers/78833\">hour-long documentary and podcast</a> on the health care workers who responded to the massacre. Aboraya has also looked at <a href=\"http://www.wmfe.org/tag/hiv\">HIV’s impact in Florida</a> and how state budget cuts have <a href=\"http://www.wmfe.org/tag/pregnancy\">reduced access to prenatal care</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rebekah Allen, a reporter at The Advocate, based in Baton Rouge, La. She is a member of the paper’s small team of reporters focused on investigative projects and enterprise stories.

His disclosures led to the appointment of an independent scientific team to examine the spill’s impacts. “I can’t think of many places that are in need of good journalism more than West Virginia is, or what higher calling journalists have than to try to write stories that make their home a better place,” Ward said in an <a href=\"http://archives.cjr.org/feature/sustained_outrage.php\">interview with the Columbia Journalism Review</a> a few years back.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of our goals with this project is to not only reach communities ProPublica hasn’t previously covered, but to support journalism that emanates from those communities. Many of the reporters have long-established connections to the regions they’re now covering.</p>\n<p>Parker, the reporter at The Southern Illinoisan, grew up and went to college in Southern Illinois. After graduating from college and graduate school, her journalism career took her to North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi. But home drew her back in 2014.</p>\n<p>“What I quickly discovered through my reporting was that a lot had changed since I graduated from Vienna High School in 2000,” she wrote in her application to the Local Reporting Network, “Poverty has always plagued much of Southern Illinois, particularly the southernmost counties. But I don’t recall people being as hopeless as they are today.</p>\n<p>“I don’t remember the poverty being as extreme and widespread, and indeed, data indicators show this is a growing problem and imminent crisis. I enjoy reporting in the region that raised me. Southern Illinois can serve up hefty servings of frustration, and the economic suffering I see breaks my heart. But there is an abundance of beauty here, of the natural and human variety. For me and many others, this will always be home.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7657783.gif\" height=\"1\">",

To help local journalists use election data to keep a close eye on candidates and races, we’re today announcing an update to our <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/electionbot/\">Election DataBot</a> app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/seeing-the-real-campaign-with-propublica-election-databot\">A partnership with the Google News Lab</a>, Election DataBot helps reporters, researchers and citizens keep track of campaign activity. The update adds a host of new information from ProPublica’s political data collection that will help users understand races in even more detail, and provide an even broader picture to their readers. DataBot users can sign up for email alerts for a particular candidate, committee or race, using a Google account.</p>\n<p>The core feature of Election DataBot remains its firehose of activity about federal candidates and committees, including campaign finance filings, congressional votes and Google Trends data. To those we’ve added congressional press releases from our <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/statements\">Represent news application</a>, news stories about incumbents from Google News, campaign videos from YouTube and deleted tweets from <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/\">Politwoops</a>.</p>\n<p>Right now, DataBot’s most complete set of information is about congressional incumbents running for re-election. The press releases and news stories are about those lawmakers, while campaign videos and deleted tweets cover challengers and open seat candidates, too.</p>\n<p>That means an even richer stream of data about high-profile contests such as the <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/electionbot/NV/senate/\">Nevada Senate race</a> or the <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/electionbot/AL/senate/\">special Senate election in Alabama</a> on Dec. 12. Election DataBot has a page for each race showing the most recent activity, meaning that reporters quickly can track super PACs spending money to support or oppose a candidate and delve more deeply into <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/electionbot/candidate/S8AL00340/\">Roy Moore</a>’s or <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/electionbot/candidate/S0AL00156/\">Doug Jones</a>’ pages or click on an item to see the FEC filing for each expenditure. Or you can search for a committee such as the <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/electionbot/committee/C00653998/\">Proven Conservative PAC</a>, which backs Moore, and sign up for an alert each time Election DataBot gets updated information about its activities.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/blog/_threeTwo400w/20171207-election-databot-firehose3.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/blog/_threeTwo800w/20171207-election-databot-firehose3.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/blog/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-election-databot-firehose3.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/blog/_threeTwo400w/20171207-election-databot-firehose3.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Election DataBot's Firehose feed for the Alabama Senate race\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We’ve also beefed up campaign finance filings from Senate candidates, which are filed on paper, thanks to the <a href=\"https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/\">Federal Election Commission’s API</a>. We’ve also updated candidate information for 2018 Senate and House races, and will be adding Twitter and YouTube accounts for candidates as they appear. This far in advance, the field in many contests is still far from clear. The candidate filing deadline in many states is still months away. But with congressional candidates raising <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/updates/statistical-summary-six-month-campaign-activity-2017-2018-election-cycle/\">more than $386 million</a> in the first six months of 2017, it is not too early to be keeping an eye on key races.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Election DataBot will get new information throughout each day, updating FEC filings every 15 minutes and other information several times a day. Because we have more information coming in, we’ve tightened up the main feed, called the Firehose, on the homepage, to cover activity from the past three days.</p>\n<p>Existing users of the DataBot will notice that we’ve removed a few items, including election forecasts from FiveThirtyEight.com and recent polls. Because the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api/v2\">Pollster API</a> we used in the past only contains polls on presidential approval and generic House of Representatives election questions, race-specific polls no longer appear. We are looking for data sources that will let us return polling data to Election DataBot.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7648658.gif\" height=\"1\">",

      "summary": {
        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/nina-martin\">Nina Martin</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Renee Montagne</span>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/\">NPR</a> </p>\n<p>On a melancholy Saturday this past February, Shalon Irving’s “village” — the friends and family she had assembled to support her as a single mother — gathered at a funeral home in a prosperous black neighborhood in southwest Atlanta to say goodbye and send her home. The afternoon light was gray but bright, flooding through tall arched windows and pouring past white columns, illuminating the flag that covered her casket. Sprays of callas and roses dotted the room like giant corsages, flanking photos from happier times: Shalon in a slinky maternity dress, sprawled across her couch with her puppy; Shalon, sleepy-eyed and cradling the tiny head of her newborn daughter, Soleil. In one portrait Shalon wore a vibrant smile and the crisp uniform of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, where she had been a lieutenant commander. Many of the mourners were similarly attired. Shalon’s father, Samuel, surveyed the rows of somber faces from the lectern. “I’ve never been in a room with so many doctors,” he marveled. “… I’ve never seen so many Ph.D.s.”</p>\n<p>At 36, Shalon had been part of their elite ranks — an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the preeminent public health institution in the U.S. There she had focused on trying to understand how structural inequality, trauma and violence made people sick. “She wanted to expose how peoples’ limited health options were leading to poor health outcomes. To kind of uncover and undo the victim blaming that sometimes happens where it’s like, ‘Poor people don’t care about their health,’” said Rashid Njai, her mentor at the agency. Her Twitter bio declared: “I see inequity wherever it exists, call it by name, and work to eliminate it.”</p>\n<p>Much of Shalon’s research had focused on how childhood experiences affect health over a lifetime. Her discovery in mid-2016 that she was pregnant with her first child had been unexpected and thrilling.</p>\n<p>Then the unthinkable had happened. Three weeks after giving birth, Shalon had collapsed and died.</p>\n<p>The sadness in the chapel was crushing. Shalon’s long-divorced parents had already buried both their sons; she had been their last remaining child. Wanda Irving had been especially close to her daughter —role model, traveling companion, emotional touchstone. She sat in the front row in a black suit and veiled hat, her face a portrait of unfathomable grief. Sometimes she held Soleil, fussing with her pink blanket. Sometimes Samuel held her, or one of Shalon’s friends.</p>\n<p>A few of Shalon’s villagers rose to pay tribute; others sat quietly, poring through their funeral programs. Daniel Sellers, Shalon’s cousin from Ohio and the baby’s godfather, spoke for all of them when he promised Wanda that she would not have to raise her only grandchild alone. “People say to me, ‘She won’t know her mother.’ That’s not true,” Sellers said. “Her mother is in each and every one of you, each and every one of us. … This child is a gift to us. When you remember this child, you remember the love that God has pushed down through her for all of us. Soleil is our gift.”</p>\n<p>Underneath the numb despair was a profound sense of failure — and an acute understanding of what Shalon’s death represented. The researcher working to eradicate disparities in health access and outcomes had become a symbol of one of the most troublesome health disparities facing black women in the U.S. today, disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality. The main federal agency seeking to understand why so many American women — especially black women — die and nearly die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth had lost one of its own. Even Shalon’s many advantages — her B.A. in sociology, her two master’s degrees and dual-subject Ph.D., her gold-plated insurance and rock-solid support system — had not been enough to ensure her survival. If a village this powerful hadn’t been able to protect her, was any black woman safe?</p>\n<p>The memorial service drew to a close, the bugle strains of “Taps” as plaintive as a howl. Two members of the U.S. Honor Guard removed the flag from Shalon’s coffin and held it aloft. Then they folded it into a precise triangle small enough for Wanda and Samuel to hold next to their hearts.</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-shalon-in-uniform-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-shalon-in-uniform-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-shalon-in-uniform-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-shalon-in-uniform-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Shalon MauRene Irving was a lieutenant commander in the uniformed ranks of the U.S. Public Health Service.\n<span>(Courtesy of Wanda Irving)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system\">as high rates of maternal mortality</a> in the U.S. have alarmed researchers, one statistic has been especially concerning. According to the CDC, black mothers in the U.S. die at three to four times the rate of white mothers, one of the widest of all racial disparities in women’s health. Put another way, a black woman is 22 percent more likely to die from heart disease than a white woman, 71 percent more likely to perish from cervical cancer, but 243 percent more likely to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes. In a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Tucker+MJ%2C+Berg+CJ%2C+Callaghan+WM%2C+Hsia+J\">national study</a> of five medical complications that are common causes of maternal death and injury, black women were two to three times more likely to die than white women who had the same condition.</p>\n<p>That imbalance has persisted for decades, and in some places, it continues to grow. In New York City, for example, black mothers are 12 times more likely to die than white mothers, according to the most recent data; from 2001 to 2005, their risk of death was seven times higher. Researchers say that widening gap reflects a dramatic improvement for white women but not for blacks.</p>\n<p>The disproportionate toll on African Americans is the main reason the U.S. maternal mortality rate is so much higher than that of other affluent countries. Black expectant and new mothers in the U.S. die at about the same rate as women in countries such as Mexico and Uzbekistan, the World Health Organization estimates.</p>\n<p>What’s more, even relatively well-off black women like Shalon Irving die or nearly die at higher rates than whites. Again, New York City offers a startling example: A <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf\">2016 analysis</a> of five years of data found that black college-educated mothers who gave birth in local hospitals were more likely to suffer severe complications of pregnancy or childbirth than white women who never graduated from high school.</p>\n<p>The fact that someone with Shalon’s social and economic advantages is at higher risk highlights how profound the inequities really are, said Raegan McDonald-Mosley, the chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, who met her in graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and was one of her closest friends. “It tells you that you can’t educate your way out of this problem. You can’t health-care-access your way out of this problem. There’s something inherently wrong with the system that’s not valuing the lives of black women equally to white women.”</p>\n<p>For much of American history, these types of disparities were largely blamed on blacks’ supposed innate susceptibility to illness — their “mass of imperfections,” as <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%E2%80%9Cmass+of+imperfections,%E2%80%9D+Dr.+W.+T.+English,+1903&source=bl&ots=juTm8PTezl&sig=73eoX656BCmAIKqxXXT1UO1hA-0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFvYX-qvbXAhVQ1WMKHYtVDtUQ6AEIKTAA#v\">one doctor wrote</a> in 1903 — and their own behavior. But now many social scientists and medical researchers agree, the problem isn’t race but racism.</p>\n<p>The systemic problems start with the type of social inequities that Shalon studied — differential access to healthy food and clean drinking water, safe neighborhoods and good schools, decent jobs and reliable transportation. Black women are more likely to be uninsured outside of pregnancy, when Medicaid kicks in, and thus more likely to start prenatal care later and to lose coverage in the postpartum period. They are more likely to have chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension that make having a baby more dangerous. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4698019/\">hospitals where they give birth</a> are often the products of historical segregation, lower in quality than those where white mothers deliver, with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Site+of+delivery+contribution+to+black-white+severe+maternal+morbidity+disparity\">significantly higher rates</a> of life-threatening complications.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-raegan-portrait-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-raegan-portrait-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-raegan-portrait-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171207-raegan-portrait-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-raegan-portrait-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Looking over Shalon’s medical records, her friend Raegan McDonald-Mosley saw many missed opportunities “at multiple parts of the health care system.”\n<span>(Ariel Zambelich for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Those problems are amplified by unconscious biases that are embedded throughout the medical system, affecting quality of care in stark and subtle ways. In the more than 200 stories of African-American mothers that ProPublica and NPR have <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/lost-mothers\">collected over the past year</a>, the feeling of being devalued and disrespected by medical providers was a constant theme. The young Florida mother-to-be whose breathing problems were blamed on obesity when in fact her lungs were filling with fluid and her heart was failing. The Arizona mother whose anesthesiologist assumed she smoked marijuana because of the way she did her hair. The Chicago-area businesswoman with a high-risk pregnancy who was so upset at her doctor’s attitude that she changed OB-GYNs in her seventh month, only to suffer a fatal postpartum stroke.</p>\n<p>Over and over, black women told of medical providers who equated being African American with being poor, uneducated, noncompliant and unworthy. “Sometimes you just know in your bones when someone feels contempt for you based on your race,” said one Brooklyn woman who took to bringing her white husband or in-laws to every prenatal visit. </p>\n<p>Hakima Tafunzi Payne, a mother of nine in Kansas City, Missouri, who used to be a labor-and-delivery nurse and still attends births as a student midwife, has seen this cultural divide as both patient and caregiver. “The nursing culture is white, middle-class, and female, so is largely built around that identity. Anything that doesn’t fit that identity is suspect,” she said. Payne, who is also a nurse educator lecturing on unconscious bias for professional organizations, recalled “the conversations that took place behind the nurse’s station that just made assumptions — a lot of victim blaming, ‘If those people would only do blah, blah, blah, things would be different.’”</p>\n<p>Black expectant and new mothers frequently told us that doctors and nurses didn’t take their pain seriously — a phenomenon borne out by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2617895\">numerous studies</a> that show <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296.full?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_U_S_A_TrendMD_0\">pain is often undertreated</a> in black patients for conditions from appendicitis to cancer. When <a href=\"http://patrissecullors.com/bio/\">Patrisse Cullors</a>, a cofounder of the Black Lives Matters movement who has become <a href=\"https://www.momsrising.org/blog/users/patrisse-cullors\">an activist to improve black maternal care</a>, had an emergency C-section in Los Angeles in March 2016, the surgeon “never explained what he was doing to me,” she said. The pain medication didn’t work: “My mother basically had to scream at the doctors to give me the proper pain meds.” When white people advocate for themselves or their family members, she said, providers “think they’re acting reasonably. When black people are advocating for our family members, we’re complaining, we’re being uppity, we don’t know what we're talking about, we’re exaggerating.”</p>\n<p>Limited diversity in the medical profession contributes to the black mothers’ sense of alienation. Blacks make up <a href=\"http://www.aamcdiversityfactsandfigures2016.org/report-section/section-3/#figure-17\">6 percent</a> of doctors (though 11 percent of OB-GYNs), 3 percent of <a href=\"http://www.aamcdiversityfactsandfigures2016.org/report-section/section-3/#figure-20\">medical school faculty</a> and less than 2 percent of National Institutes of Health-funded principal investigators. “That's a real problem that across the spectrum that [black women] are not feeling listened to and respected—that’s a structural problem,” said <a href=\"https://nursing.ucsf.edu/faculty/monica-mclemore\">Monica McLemore</a>, a nursing professor at the University of California­, San Francisco, who has conducted focus groups with dozens of mothers as part of a $50 million <a href=\"https://scienceofcaring.ucsf.edu/research/california-initiative-aims-dramatically-reduce-preterm-birth-improve-outcomes\">initiative</a> to reduce preterm births. “The health sector doesn’t want to admit how much of this is about us.”</p>\n<p>But it’s the discrimination that black women experience in the rest of their lives — the double-whammy of race and gender — that may ultimately be the most significant factor in poor maternal outcomes. An expanding field of research shows that the stress of being a black woman in American society can take a significant physical toll during pregnancy and childbirth.</p>\n<figure>\n<h3>Watch the Video</h3>\n<p>The U.S. medical system is still haunted by slavery.</p>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IfYRzxeMdGs?rel=0&showinfo=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>“It’s chronic stress that just happens all the time — there is never a period where there’s rest from it, it’s everywhere, it’s in the air, it’s just affecting everything,” said <a href=\"http://drfledamjackson.com/biography\">Fleda Mask Jackson</a>, an Atlanta researcher and member of the <a href=\"http://blackmamasmatter.org/\">Black Mamas Matter Alliance</a> who studies disparities in birth outcomes.</p>\n<p>It’s a type of stress from which education and class provide no protection. “When you interview these doctors and lawyers and business executives, when you interview African-American college graduates, it’s not like their lives have been a walk in the park,” said <a href=\"https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/prevention-and-community-health-office-dean/michael-lu\">Michael Lu</a>, a longtime disparities researcher and former head of the <a href=\"https://mchb.hrsa.gov/\">Maternal and Child Health Bureau</a> of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the main federal agency funding programs for mothers and infants. “It’s the experience of having to work harder than anybody else just to get equal pay and equal respect. It’s being followed around when you’re shopping at a nice store, or being stopped by the police when you’re driving in a nice neighborhood.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/people/profile/35/Arline_T_Geronimus\">Arline Geronimus,</a> a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, coined the term “weathering” for how this continuous stress wears away at the body. Weathering “causes a lot of different health vulnerabilities and increases susceptibility to infection,” she said, “but also early onset of chronic diseases, in particular, hypertension and diabetes” — conditions that disproportionately affect blacks at much younger ages than whites. It accelerates aging at the cellular level; in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2861506/\">2010 study</a>, Geronimus and colleagues found that the telomeres (chromosomal markers of aging) of black women in their 40s and 50s appeared 7 1/2 years older on average than those of whites.</p>\n<p>Weathering can have particularly serious repercussions in pregnancy and childbirth, the most physiologically complex time in a woman’s life. Stress has been linked to one of the most common and consequential pregnancy complications, preterm birth. Black women are <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/materials/PrematureBirthReportCard-United-States-2017.pdf\">49 percent more likely</a> than whites to deliver prematurely (and, closely related, black infants are twice as likely as white babies to die before their first birthday). Here again, income and education aren’t protective. </p>\n<p>The effects on the mother’s health may also be far-reaching. Maternal age is an important risk factor for many severe pregnancy-related complications, as well as for chronic diseases that can affect pregnancy, like hypertension. “As women get older, birth outcomes get worse,” Lu said. “If that happens in the 40s for white women, it actually starts to happen for African-American women in their 30s.”</p>\n<p>This means that for black women, the risks for pregnancy likely start at an earlier age than many clinicians — and women— realize, and the effects on their bodies may be much greater than for white women. This doesn’t mean that pregnancy should be thought of as inherently scary or dangerous for black women (or anyone). It does mean, in Geronimus’ view, that “a black woman of any social class, as early as her mid-20s, should be attended to differently” — with greater awareness of the potential challenges ahead.</p>\n<p>That’s a paradigm shift that professional organizations and providers have barely begun to wrap their heads around. “There may be individual doctors or hospitals that are doing it [accounting for the higher risk of black women], but ... there’s not much of that going on,” Lu said. Should doctors and clinicians be taking into consideration this added layer of vulnerability? </p>\n<p>“Yeah,” Lu said. “I truly think they should.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-kid-photo-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-kid-photo-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-kid-photo-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-kid-photo-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Shalon, her baby brother Simone and her older brother Sam III, in a photo taken in the mid-1980s\n<span>(Courtesy of Wanda Irving)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Shalon Irving’s history is almost a textbook example of the kinds of strains and stresses that make high-achieving black women vulnerable. The child of two Dartmouth graduates, she grew up in Portland, Oregon, where her father’s father was pastor of a black church. Even <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/portland-race-against-the-past-white-supremacy/\">in its current liberal incarnation</a>, Portland is one of the whitest large cities in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Thirty years ago, Portland was a much more uncomfortable place to be black. African-American life there was often characterized by social isolation, which Geronimus’ research suggests can be especially stressful. Samuel Irving spent years working as a railroad engineer; he got a law degree and later ran a city agency, but felt his prospects were still constrained by his race. Wanda held various jobs in marketing and communications, including at the U.S. Forest Service. In elementary school, Shalon was sometimes the only African-American kid in her class. “There were many mornings where she would stand outside banging on the door wanting to come back into the house because she didn’t want to go to school,” her mother recently recalled.</p>\n<p>Shalon’s strategy for fitting in was to be smarter than everyone else. She read voraciously, wrote a column for a black-owned weekly newspaper and skipped a grade. Books and writing helped her cope with trauma and sorrow — first the death of her 20-month-old brother Simone in a car accident when she was six, then the fracturing of her parents’ marriage, then the diagnosis of her beloved older brother, Sam III, with a virulent form of early-onset multiple sclerosis when he was 17. Amid all the family troubles, Shalon was funny and driven, with a fierce sense of loyalty and “a moral compass that was amazing,” her mother said. She was also overweight and often anxious, given to daydreaming (as she later put it) about “alternative realities where people hadn’t died and things had not been lost.” When it came time to go away to college, she chose the historically black <a href=\"http://www.hamptonu.edu/\">Hampton University</a> in Virginia. “She wanted to feel that nurturing environment,” Wanda said. “She had had enough.”</p>\n<p>By then, Shalon had noticed that many of her relatives — her mother’s mother, her aunts, her far-flung cousins — died in their 30s and 40s. Her brother, Sam III, sardonically joked that the family had a “death gene,” but Shalon didn’t think that was funny. “She didn’t understand why there was such a disparity with other families that had all these long lives,” Wanda said. Shalon nagged her father to stop smoking and her mother to lose weight. She set an example, shedding nearly 100 pounds while managing to graduate summa cum laude. At the start of graduate school at Purdue University, she was a svelte 138 pounds, “very classy and elegant, a lot like her mom,” said Bianca Pryor, a master’s student in consumer behavior who became one of what Shalon called her cherished circle of “sister friends.”</p>\n<p>They were all bearing the same burden. “There’s this feeling that we’re carrying the expectations of generations, the first ones trying to climb the corporate ladder, trying to climb in academe,” said Pryor, now a marketing executive in New York City. “There is this idea that we have to work twice as hard as everyone else. But there’s also, ‘I’m first-generation, I don’t know the ropes, I don’t how to use my social capital.’ There’s a bit of shame in that … this constant checking in with yourself — am I doing this right?”</p>\n<p>Shalon set the bar especially high: She was pursuing a double Ph.D. in sociology and gerontology, focusing on themes she would return to often — the long-term effects of early childhood trauma and maltreatment, the impact of the parent-child relationship on lifelong health. She finished in under five years, once again with top honors — “one of the best writers I’ve had in my academic career,” her adviser, <a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/aging/ferraro/\">sociologist Kenneth Ferraro</a>, said.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-wanda-shalon-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-wanda-shalon-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-wanda-shalon-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-wanda-shalon-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Wanda and Shalon were so close, “they were like the ‘Gilmore Girls,’” one friend said.\n<span>(Courtesy of Wanda Irving)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>She tried teaching, then decided to pursue a second master’s degree, this time from Johns Hopkins. She was also juggling family responsibilities. Wanda had followed Shalon around the country, earning her own master’s degree and working in nonprofit management. “They were like the ‘Gilmore Girls,’” Pryor said. In 2008, Sam III joined them in Baltimore to take part in a study on an experimental MS therapy. With his family’s support, he’d managed to finish college and run a poetry-slam nonprofit for kids. His next goal was to walk across the stage to receive his diploma instead of using his wheelchair. In February 2009, while he was doing physical rehab to regain strength in his legs, a blood clot traveled to his lung, killing him at the age of 32. Afterward, Wanda and Shalon clung to each other more tightly than ever.</p>\n<p>In 2011 came what Ferraro called Shalon’s “change-the-world opportunity” — a consulting gig at the CDC with Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” initiative. Soon she joined the agency’s prestigious <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/eis/index.html\">Epidemic Intelligence Service</a>, a training program in applied epidemiology — in her case, with a focus on community health — whose members served as first responders in health emergencies. As part of the uniformed ranks of the U.S. Public Health Service, she could eventually discharge her student debt — more than $165,000 for Hopkins alone — travel, buy a house. “The permanence was very appealing,” Pryor said.</p>\n<p>What Shalon wasn’t prepared for was how unfulfilled she was. After Johns Hopkins, she had worked on the frontlines helping at-risk infants, teenage girls and mothers with HIV/AIDS. She was passionate about improving food and housing security to reduce people’s risk for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems, but felt like much of her CDC research ended up sitting on a shelf. It bothered her that she rarely met the people behind the data she was analyzing. “She might see the numbers, but I don’t think she actually saw that little girl or little boy have a healthier lunch,” Pryor said.</p>\n<p>The stress and frustration triggered the old corrosive self-doubts. But gradually, Shalon saw a way out of the box. She joined the CDC’s Division of Violence Prevention, refocusing on issues around trauma and domestic abuse— a mission she saw as “liberating” for African-American women, Wanda said. She started a coaching business called <a href=\"http://www.inclusivitystandard.com/\">Inclusivity Standard</a> to advise young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who wanted to get into college or grad school, as well as organizations seeking to become more diverse. She enlisted her mother, now working as a consultant, and Pryor to join her team. And she decided to write a self-help book, on the theory that many people in the communities she cared about couldn’t afford psychotherapy or didn’t trust it. “She was one of those people — one thing is just not enough,” said her coauthor <a href=\"http://northstarofgeorgia.com/staff/\">Habiba Tran</a>, a therapist and life coach with a multicultural clientele. “One modality is just not enough. One way of [reaching people] is just not enough.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-shalon-couch-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-shalon-couch-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-shalon-couch-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171207-shalon-couch-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-shalon-couch-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>“No words have been created to adequately capture the fear and love and excitement that I feel right now,” Shalon, shown here with her puppy Lady Day, wrote to her daughter.\n<span>(Courtesy of Wanda Irving)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Shalon couldn’t remember a time when she didn’t want to be a mother. But her romantic life had been a “20-year dating debacle,” she admitted in the manuscript of her self-help book, in part because “I am deathly scared of heartbreak and disappointment, and letting people in comes with the very real risk of both.”</p>\n<p>In 2014, when Shalon was 34, medical problems forced the issue. For years she’d been suffering from uterine fibroids — non-malignant tumors that affect <a href=\"http://www.ebony.com/wellness-empowerment/elevate-fibroids-black-women\">up to 80 percent</a> of black women, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia and pelvic pain. No one knows what causes fibroids or why blacks are so susceptible. What is known is that the tumors can interfere with fertility — indeed, black women are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr067.pdf\">nearly twice as likely</a> to have infertility problems as whites, and when they undergo treatment, there’s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26049056\">much less likelihood</a> that the treatments will succeed. Surgery bought her a little time, but her OB-GYN urged her not to delay getting pregnant much longer.</p>\n<p>Shalon had spent her adult years defying stereotypes about black women; now she wrestled with the reality that by embracing single motherhood, she could become one. The financial risk was substantial — she’d just purchased a town house in the quiet Sandy Springs area north of Atlanta, and her CDC insurance only covered artificial insemination for wives using their husbands’ sperm. In Portland, no one would have blinked an eye at an unmarried professional woman having a child on her own, but in Atlanta, “there is very much a vibe there that things should happen in a certain order,” Pryor said. “And Shalon was not having that at all. She was like, ‘Nope, this is what it is.’”</p>\n<p>The gamble — funded with her parents’ help — ended in a series of devastating failures. In September 2015, in the midst of one unsuccessful insemination treatment, Shalon was alarmed to discover that her right arm had become swollen and hard. Doctors found a blood clot and diagnosed her with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/factor-v-leiden/basics/definition/con-20032637\">Factor V Leiden</a>, a genetic mutation that makes blood prone to abnormal clumping. Suddenly a part of the family’s medical mystery was solved. Wanda’s mother had died of a pulmonary embolism, so had Sam III, so had other members of their extended family. But no one had been tested for the mutation, which is primarily associated with European ancestry. Had they known they carried it, maybe Sam’s deadly blood clot could have been prevented. It was a what-if too painful to dwell on.</p>\n<p>By April 2016, Shalon had given up. She had a new boyfriend and she was on her way to Puerto Rico to help with the CDC’S Zika response, working to prevent the spread of the virus to expectant mothers and their unborn babies. There she discovered she’d gotten pregnant by accident. Her excitement was tempered by fear that the baby might have contracted Zika, which can cause microcephaly and other birth defects. But a barrage of medical tests confirmed all was well.</p>\n<p>More good news: A few weeks later Pryor learned she was pregnant, too. “All right,” she told Shalon, “let’s finally go after our rainbows and unicorns! Because for so long it was just dark clouds and rain.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-bianca-pryor-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-bianca-pryor-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-bianca-pryor-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171207-bianca-pryor-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-bianca-pryor-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>A worried Bianca Pryor quizzed her best friend from grad school: “Are you getting out of the house? Are you going for your walks?”\n<span>(Melissa Bunni Elian for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In reality, Shalon’s many risk factors — including her clotting disorder, her fibroid surgery, the 36 years of wear and tear on her telomeres, her weight — boded a challenging nine months. She also had a history of high blood pressure, though it was now under control without medication. “If I was the doctor taking care of her, I'd be like, ‘Oh, this is going to be a tough one,’” her OB-GYN friend Raegan McDonald-Mosley said.</p>\n<p>Shalon got though the physical challenges surprisingly well. Her team at Emory University, one of the premier health systems in the South, had no trouble managing her clotting disorder with the blood thinner Lovenox. They worried that scarring from the fibroid surgery could result in a rupture if her uterus stretched too much, so they scheduled a C-section at 37 weeks. At several points, Shalon’s blood pressure did spike, Wanda said, but doctors ruled out preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced hypertension) and the numbers always fell back to normal.</p>\n<p>Wanda blamed stress. There was the painful end to Shalon’s romance with her baby’s father and her dashed hopes of raising their child together. There were worries about money and panic attacks about the difficulties of being a black single mother in the South in the era of Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice. Shalon told everyone she was hoping for a girl.</p>\n<p>Steeped in research about how social support could buffer against stress and adversity, Shalon joined online groups for single moms and assembled a stalwart community she could quickly deploy for help. “She was all about the village,” Rashid Njai said. “She’d say, ‘I’m making sure that when I have my baby, the village is activated and ready to go.’”</p>\n<p>She poured more of her anxious energy into finishing the first draft of the book. She sent Tran the manuscript on Jan. 2, the day before the planned C-section, then typed one last note to her child. Boy or girl, its nickname would be Sunny, in honor of her brother Sam, her “sunshine.” </p>\n<p>“You will always be my most important accomplishment,” she wrote. “No words have been created to adequately capture the fear and love and excitement that I feel right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Until recently, much of the discussion about maternal mortality has focused on pregnancy and childbirth. But according to the most recent CDC data, more than half of maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period, and one-third happen seven or more days after delivery. For American women in general, postpartum care can be dangerously inadequate — often no more than a single appointment four to six weeks after going home. “If you’ve had a cesarean delivery, if you’ve had preeclampsia, if you’ve had gestational diabetes or diabetes, if you go home on an anticoagulant — all those women need to be seen significantly sooner than six weeks,” said <a href=\"https://obgyn.duke.edu/news/haywood-brown-md-becomes-68th-president-acog\">Haywood Brown</a>, a professor at Duke University medical school. Brown has made reforming postpartum care one of his main initiatives as president of the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/\">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>.</p>\n<p>The dangers of sporadic postpartum care may be particularly great for black mothers. African Americans have higher rates of C-section and are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26444126\">more than twice as likely to be readmitted</a> to the hospital in the month following the surgery. They have disproportionate rates of preeclampsia and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28813232\">peripartum cardiomyopathy</a> (a type of heart failure), two leading killers in the days and weeks after delivery. They’re twice as likely as white women to have postpartum depression, which contributes to poor outcomes, but they are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733216/\">much less likely</a> to receive mental health treatment. If they experience discrimination or disrespect during pregnancy or childbirth, they may be <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692572\">more likely</a> to skip postpartum visits to check on their own health (they do keep pediatrician appointments for their babies). Lack of paid maternity leave and childcare can create additional hurdles. In <a href=\"http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(17)30368-X/fulltext\">one study</a> published earlier this year, two-thirds of low-income black women never made it to their doctor visit.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, many providers wrongly assume that the risks end when the baby is born — and that women who came through pregnancy and delivery without problems will stay healthy. In the case of black women, providers may not understand their true biological risks or evaluate those risks in a big-picture way. “The maternal experience isn’t over right at delivery. All of the due diligence that gets applied during the prenatal period needs to continue into the postpartum period,” said Eleni Tsigas, executive director of the <a href=\"http://preeclampsia.org/\">Preeclampsia Foundation</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not just doctors and nurses who need to think differently. Like a lot of expectant mothers, Shalon had an elaborate plan for how she wanted to give birth, even including what she wanted her surgical team to talk about (nothing political) and who would announce the baby’s gender (her mother, not a doctor or nurse). But like most pregnant women, she didn’t have a postpartum care plan for herself. “It was just trusting in the system that things were gonna go okay,” Wanda said. “And that if something came up, she’d be able to handle it.”</p>\n<p>The birth was “a beautiful time,” Wanda said. Shalon did so well that she convinced her doctor to let her and Soleil — French for “sun” — leave the hospital after two nights (three or four nights are more typical). Then at home, “things got real,” Pryor said. “It was Shalon and her mom trying to figure things out, and the late nights, and trying to get baby on schedule. Shalon was very honest. She told me, ‘Friend, this is hard.’”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-bianca-with-son-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-bianca-with-son-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-bianca-with-son-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171207-bianca-with-son-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-bianca-with-son-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>When Pryor found she was pregnant, too, with her son Everton, she told Shalon, “Let’s finally go after our rainbows and unicorns!” <span>(Melissa Bunni Elian for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>C-sections have much higher complication rates than vaginal births. In Shalon’s case, the trouble — a painful lump on her incision — emerged a few days after she went home. The first doctor she saw, on Jan. 12, said it was nothing, but as she and her mother were leaving his office, they ran into her longtime OB-GYN, Elizabeth Collins. Collins took a look and diagnosed a hematoma — blood trapped in layers of healing skin, something that happens in about 1 percent of C-sections. The OB-GYN drained the “fluctuant mass” (as her notes described it), and “copious bloody non-purulent material” poured out from the one-inch incision. Collins also arranged for a visiting nurse to come by the house every other day to change the dressing. Collins didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Over the next two weeks, Shalon’s records show three more visits to Emory and two nursing visits at home. She feared that the incision wasn’t healing fast enough, perhaps because the blood thinners she was taking to prevent an embolism —another C-section risk — were hampering coagulation. But a wound specialist said everything looked OK. Shalon was worried about Soleil, too: Breastfeeding was harder than expected, and she’d stopped taking narcotic painkillers because she thought they were making the baby groggy. But less powerful painkillers weren’t working; between the pain and the anxiety, she was hardly sleeping. “Patient has poor endurance,” the visiting nurse noted on Jan. 16. “Leaving the home is a TAXING and CONSIDERABLE effort.”</p>\n<p>What troubled the nurse most, though, was Shalon’s blood pressure. On Jan. 16 it was 158/100, high enough to raise concerns about postpartum preeclampsia, which can lead to seizures and stroke. But Shalon didn’t have other symptoms, such as headache or blurred vision. She made an appointment to see the OB-GYN for the next day, then ended up being too overwhelmed to go, the visiting nurse noted on Jan. 18. In that same record, the nurse wrote that Shalon had to change the dressing on her wound “sometimes several times a day due to large amounts of red drainage. This is adding to her stress as a new mom.” Her pain was 5 on a scale of 10, preventing her from “sleeping/relaxing.” Overall, Shalon told the nurse, “it just doesn’t feel right.” When the nurse measured her blood pressure on the cuff Shalon kept at home, the reading was 158/112. On the nurse’s equipment, the reading was 174/118.</p>\n<p>“We provide caring and compassionate care to all of our patients,” the Visiting Nurse Health System said in an email. “She was in our care for less than four days but we gave the very best care we could.”</p>\n<p>Under <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Womens-Health/Preeclampsia-and-Hypertension-in-Pregnancy\">current ACOG guidelines</a>, blood pressure readings that high should trigger more aggressive action, such as an immediate trip to the doctor for further evaluation, possibly medication and more careful monitoring. A history of hypertension and multiple other risks should raise more red flags, Tsigas said. “We need to look holistically at the risk factors irrespective of whether or not she had a diagnosis of preeclampsia,” she said. “If somebody has a whole plateful of risk factors, how are you treating them differently?” High blood pressure in the postpartum period should always be considered an emergency, she said.</p>\n<p>“It would have made sense to admit her to the hospital for a complete work-up, including chest xray, an echocardiogram to evaluate for heart failure, and titration of her medication (both pain meds and hypertension meds) to sort out what she needed to feel OK and get [her] blood pressure out of the severe range,” wrote one doctor, a leading expert on postpartum care, who agreed to look at Shalon’s records at ProPublica’s request, but asked not to be identified. “Education on signs / symptoms of stroke seems insufficient — we don’t want to wait until someone is having a stroke to get their BP treated. A next-day follow-up for a BP of 174/118 seems questionable for a postpartum woman. Same-day assessment in her provider’s office, or in the ER, would have been very much within the bounds of common practice.”</p>\n<p>Instead, Shalon was given an appointment for the following day, Jan. 19, with an OB-GYN at Women’s Center at Emory St. Joseph’s, which handled her primary care. By then, Shalon’s blood pressure had fallen, and there were “no symptoms concerning for postpartum [preeclampsia],” the doctor wrote in his notes. He wrote that Shalon was healing “appropriately” and thought her jumps in blood pressure were likely related to “poor pain control.” Wanda and Shalon left feeling more frustrated than ever. </p>\n<p>At home over the next couple of days, Wanda noticed that one of Shalon’s legs was larger than the other. “She said, ‘Yeah, I know, Mom, and my knee hurts, I can’t bend it.”</p>\n<p>When McDonald-Mosley looked over the voluminous medical records a few months later, what jumped out at her was the sense that Shalon’s caregivers didn’t seem to think of her as a patient who needed a heightened level of attention, despite the complexity of her pregnancy.</p>\n<p>“She had all these risk factors. If you’re gonna pick someone who’s going to have a problem, it’s gonna be her. … She needs to be treated with caution.” The fact that her symptoms defied easy categorization was all the more reason to be vigilant, McDonald-Mosley said. “There were all these opportunities to identify that something was going wrong. To act on them sooner and they were missed. At multiple levels. At multiple parts of the health care system. They were missed.”</p>\n<p>Shalon’s other friends were growing uneasy, too. Back in New York, Bianca Pryor had her own pregnancy emergency — her son was born very prematurely, at 24 weeks — so she couldn’t be in Atlanta. But she and Shalon talked often by phone. “She knew so much about her body one would think she was an M.D. and not a Ph.D. To hear her be concerned about her legs — that worried me.” Pryor encouraged her, “‘Friend, are you getting out of the house? Are you going for your walks? She told me, ‘No, I’m on my chaise lounge, and that’s about as much as I can do.’”</p>\n<p>Habiba Tran was so upset at Shalon’s condition that she took her frustrations out on her friend. “I was cussing her out. ‘Go to the f— ing doctor.’ She’s like, ‘I called them. I talked to them. I went to see them. Get off my back.’”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-wanda-with-dad-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-wanda-with-dad-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-wanda-with-dad-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-wanda-with-dad-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Shalon took this selfie with her dad, Samuel, and her newborn daughter on the morning of Jan. 24, 2017. Twelve hours later, she collapsed.\n<span>(Courtesy of Wanda Irving)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>On the morning of Tuesday, Jan. 24, Shalon took a selfie with her father, who’d been visiting for a week, then sent him to the airport to catch a flight back to Portland. Towards noon, she and Wanda and the baby drove to the Emory Women’s Center one more time. This time, Shalon saw a nurse practitioner. “We said, ‘Look, there's something wrong here, she’s not feeling well,’” Wanda recalled. “‘One leg is larger than the other, she’s still gaining weight’— nine pounds in 10 days — ‘the blood pressure is still up, there’s gotta be something wrong.”</p>\n<p>The nurse’s records confirmed Shalon had swelling in both legs, with more swelling in the right one. She noted that Shalon had complained of “some mild headaches” and her blood pressure was back up to 163/99, but she didn’t have other preeclampsia signs, like blurred vision. She checked the incision — “warm dry no [sign/symptom] of infection” — and noted Shalon’s mental state (“cooperative, appropriate mood &amp; affect, normal judgment”). She ordered an ultrasound to check the legs for blood clots, as well as preeclampsia screening.</p>\n<p>Both tests came back negative. As Wanda remembers it, Shalon was insistent: “There <em>is</em> something wrong, I know my body. I don’t feel well, my legs are swollen, I’m gaining weight. I’m not voiding. I’m drinking a lot of water, but I’m retaining the water.” Before sending Shalon home, the nurse gave her a prescription for the blood pressure medication nifedipine, which is often used to treat pregnancy-related hypertension.</p>\n<p>Emory Healthcare “is dedicated to the highest quality patient care,” it said in an email. It declined to answer questions about Shalon’s care, citing patient confidentiality.</p>\n<p>Shalon and Wanda stopped at the pharmacy, then decided to go out to dinner with the baby. While they ate, they talked about a trip Shalon had planned for the three of them to take in just a few weeks. Ever since Sam III had died, Wanda and Shalon made a point of traveling someplace special on painful anniversaries. To mark his 40th birthday and the eighth anniversary of his death, Shalon had gotten the idea of going to Dubai. (“It’s cheap,” Shalon had told Wanda. “The money is worth so much more there. It’s supposed to be beautiful.”) She had long ago purchased their tickets and ordered the baby’s passport. Now Wanda was worried — would she be feeling well enough to make such a big trip with an infant? Shalon wasn’t willing to give up hope just yet. Wanda recalls her saying, “I’ll be fine, I’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>They got home and sat in Shalon’s bedroom for a while, laughing and playing with the baby. Around 8:30 p.m., Shalon suddenly declared, “I just don’t know, Mom, I just don’t feel well.” She took one of the blood pressure pills. An hour later, while she and Wanda were chatting, Shalon clutched her heart, gasped and passed out.</p>\n<p>Paramedics arrived to find Shalon on the floor near the foot of her bed “pulseless and not breathing…” They tried to stabilize her, then rushed her to Atlanta’s Northside Hospital, just a couple of miles from her home. In the emergency room, doctors discovered that the breathing tube had been “incorrectly placed,” according to the ambulance service report — into her esophagus instead of her lungs. She never regained consciousness. Four days later, on Jan. 28, Wanda and Samuel withdrew life support and she died.</p>\n<p>The news spread quickly among her colleagues at the CDC. William Callaghan, chief of the maternal and infant health branch, recalled in March that his boss, who had visited Shalon at the hospital, called to let him know. “It was a chilling phone call,” said Callaghan, one of the nation’s leading researchers on maternal mortality. “It certainly takes, in that moment, what I do, it made it very, very, very concrete. ... This was not about data, this was not about whether it was going up or it was going down. It was about this tragic event that happened to this woman, her family.”</p>\n<p>Northside declined to do an autopsy, telling Wanda and Samuel that none was required, they recalled. (The hospital declined to comment.) So Wanda paid $4,500 for an autopsy by the medical examiners in neighboring DeKalb County. The report came back three months later. Noting that Shalon’s heart showed signs of damage consistent with hypertension, it attributed her death to complications of high blood pressure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Wanda always knew she would be spending a lot of time caring for her granddaughter. She and Shalon loved the idea of the three of them making their way in the world together, trying to change it for the better.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171206-flag-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171206-flag-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171206-flag-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171206-flag-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171206-flag-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The flag that covered Shalon’s casket is now in a memorial case with other mementos and photos\n<span>(Sheila Pree Bright for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Instead, Wanda has had to find a way to go on without her daughter and best friend. She took a break from her consultant work and moved into Shalon’s cozy townhouse, now crowded with baby books and gear, to assume her new role. Soleil was colicky, prone to gastric problems that kept both of them up all night. Shalon’s villagers stopped by often to help, but much of the time Wanda was on her own. Her grief was most acute at nights, but she couldn’t let it interfere with her duties to Soleil.</p>\n<p>Eventually the colic went away and Soleil thrived. In June, Wanda and her five-month-old granddaughter went to Chattanooga for the annual meeting of U.S. Public Health Service scientists. A new honor — the Shalon Irving Memorial (Junior) Scientist Officer of the Year Award — had been created to celebrate Shalon’s legacy, and Wanda had been asked to say a few words. She handed the baby to one of Shalon’s CDC colleagues and took the small stage.</p>\n<p>“Striving for excellence is a choice,” she told the audience through barely suppressed tears. “It is a commitment. … It’s a struggle to become the person you want to be. It’s harder than you want. It takes longer than you want. And it takes more out of you than you expected it should.”</p>\n<p>Shalon personified excellence, Wanda said. “I don’t know if Shalon became the woman that she ultimately wanted to be. But I do know that she wanted to be the woman she was.”</p>\n<p>She also knew how Shalon wanted to raise her daughter, and she was determined to do the same: reading to her, traveling with her, taking her to gymnastic and music classes. “She wanted Soleil to go to Montessori school, so I’m looking for a Montessori school for her,” Wanda said. “She wanted her to be christened, we got her christened.” Wanda and Soleil have developed a routine: Every morning they say hello to the photos of Shalon on the living room walls. Every evening they say goodnight. Sometimes Wanda shows Soleil the flag from her mother’s casket, now encased in a wooden frame. She set aside other mementos for later — the academic writings, the certificates and awards, the manuscript of her book with Tran. If all goes according to plan, it will be published early next year.</p>\n<p>One Saturday afternoon in October, Wanda received another book, this one compiled by Shalon’s friends from the Epidemic Intelligence Service and entitled “Letters to Soleil.” She put the baby on her lap and said, “I’m gonna read you some letters about your mom.” One thing Wanda has tried never to do is cry in front of Soleil. But as she began reading aloud, she was sobbing. “And Soleil just kept looking at me — she couldn’t understand what was going on. And about a minute later she took my glasses off with her hands and put them down and then laid her head right on my chest and started patting me. Which made me cry all the more.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-wanda-soleil-end-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171207-wanda-soleil-end-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171207-wanda-soleil-end-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171207-wanda-soleil-end-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171207-wanda-soleil-end-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Wanda in the living room of the town house she shares with Soleil. A photo of Shalon is in the background.\n<span>(Sheila Pree Bright for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Shalon was a letter-writer too. One day not long after the funeral, Wanda found a note that her daughter had written to her two years earlier, around the sixth anniversary of Sam III’s death. Shalon had left it among the other important items in her computer, trusting that if something ever happened to her, Wanda would find it. The letter reads like a premonition of her own death: Shalon wasn’t afraid for herself, but agonized over how it would affect her mother.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am sorry that I have left you. On the particular day that I am writing this I have no idea how that may have occurred but know that I would never choose to leave.</p>\n<p>I know it seems impossible right now, but please do not let this break you. I want you to be happy and smile. I want you to know that I am being watched after by my brothers and grandma and that we are all watching you. Please try not to cry. Use your energy instead to feel my love through time and space. Nothing can break the bond we have and you will forever be my mommy and I your baby girl!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now 11 months old, Soleil has her mother’s precociousness, energy and headstrong yet sweet disposition. Like the sun she was named for, “she just lights up a room when she smiles,” Wanda said. She comes into Wanda’s bed every night and wakes her early to play. “She’ll bite my nose and kick me — ‘Nana, time to get up! Time to get up!’” And so Wanda does.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7646928.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/duaa-eldeib\">Duaa Eldeib</a> </p>\n<p>A top juvenile official testified Tuesday that guards at a southern Illinois youth correctional facility have created a “pipeline to prison” that is hampering the state’s ability to fulfill its juvenile justice mission.</p>\n<p>More than 100 people gathered at a nearly five-hour hearing before the House Appropriations-Public Safety Committee to address reports of violence in Department of Juvenile Justice facilities and the state’s adult prisons.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Bankhead, the state’s independent juvenile ombudsman, focused her testimony on a series of alleged assaults by teenagers on staff at the Illinois Youth Center at Harrisburg in southern Illinois.</p>\n<p>ProPublica Illinois <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-youths-adult-prison\">reported in October</a> that guards and other employees there have pursued more criminal charges for youth-on-staff assaults since 2016 than all other state juvenile correctional facilities combined. </p>\n<p>Those assaults included spitting on, pushing or punching guards.</p>\n<p>Typically, the cases would have been handled internally, with youths losing privileges, spending time in solitary confinement, or having their sentences extended instead of being charged criminally. </p>\n<p>They were charged as adults because they had turned 18 while in juvenile custody. Those who were convicted received sentences in adult prisons that range from three to eight years, meaning they will be convicted felons when they are released.</p>\n<p>“IYC Harrisburg’s pipeline to prison is undermining DJJ’s reform efforts to rehabilitate youth and increase public safety,” Bankhead told lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Bankhead said she had difficulty reconciling the department’s efforts to create a more positive, rehabilitative environment for youths with the pattern of criminal charges for staff assaults. The overwhelming majority of the incidents, she said, did not “involve bodily harm to staff.”</p>\n<p>She said she believed guards and other employees were reluctant to adopt reform measures.</p>\n<p>“I’m left with one conclusion,” Bankhead said. “A resistant prison culture.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Kelly Cassidy, the Chicago Democrat who called the hearing, opened by saying providing a safe environment in which guards and other staff feel respected should not mean sacrificing the security or rehabilitation of those in custody.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that any of those things are mutually exclusive,” she said.</p>\n<p>The juvenile justice department has implemented a number of reforms over the past several years, including eliminating the use of solitary confinement as punishment. Guards say some of those reforms have left them without the tools they need to do their jobs effectively. </p>\n<p>Anne Irving, the director of public policy with AFSCME Council 31, the union that represents correctional officers at the juvenile facility in Harrisburg and across the state, said at Tuesday’s hearing that the policy changes have created safety challenges for her members and resulted in a significant rise in violence and assaults.</p>\n<p>“I hope we can begin today with a common agreement,” Irving said, “that no one in this room believes it is acceptable that anyone’s job would include being routinely spit on, groped, splashed with urine or feces, or for that matter, punched or stabbed or otherwise assaulted.” </p>\n<p>Several speakers referenced the ban on the use of solitary as punishment. Department policies now only allow for its use under limited circumstances.</p>\n<p>The move away from solitary came as part of a federal consent decree after the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois sued the department for not adequately serving or treating the youths in the department’s custody.</p>\n<p>“We share in the concerns about violence in the DJJ facilities,” ACLU attorney Lindsay Miller said. “Institutional violence not only presents an immediate threat to the safety and well-being of the staff and youth, but also interferes with the successful treatment and rehabilitation of our clients.”</p>\n<p>Two speakers went even further. Julie Biehl, director of the Children and Family Justice Center at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, and Elizabeth Clarke, president of the Juvenile Justice Initiative, a nonprofit that advocates for youths in the justice system, called for an end to sending youths to large juvenile correctional facilities, which include Harrisburg and a facility in St. Charles.</p>\n<p>Citing ProPublica Illinois’ article, Clarke said in written testimony that the story revealed “a stunning indication of the failure” to adapt to the reform. </p>\n<p>Heidi Mueller, director of the juvenile justice department, said there was “no quick fix” to the agency’s issues.</p>\n<p>“There is no replacement for rolling up our sleeves and digging in and building a safer and healthier climate step by thoughtful, informed step,” she said.</p>\n<p>Panelists agreed on possible solutions. They included hiring more workers, improving communication between the department and staff, increasing programming for the youths and training for staff, particularly in dealing with youths with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Cassidy said she plans to hold additional hearings on the issue in 2018 and to continue monitoring the situation in Harrisburg.</p>\n<p>“Whether they’re right or wrong to do it, the staff that are going around the department to make these charges are acting out of a sense of helplessness, too.” Cassidy said. “I don’t think it’s the right way to go, but we have to look at why they’re doing it and address that.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7637893.gif\" height=\"1\">",

But this appears to be the first time they’ve done so while Kushner, whose title is senior adviser to the president, is the lead administration official brokering a peace plan.</p>\n<p>Advocates of a two-state solution said the donation was troubling given Kushner’s role.</p>\n<p>“Under normal circumstances you would expect someone who has a background of activism related to Israel to be working very hard to take a step back from that to show that he can be a credible mediator. Not only is that not the case, it’s the opposite,” said Lara Friedman, president of the <a href=\"https://fmep.org/\">Foundation for Middle East Peace</a>.</p>\n<p>Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which eat away at any future Palestinian state, are one of the main obstacles to a two-state solution. Bet El, which was <a href=\"https://forward.com/news/israel/359902/inside-the-west-bank-settlement-that-trumps-envoy-david-friedman-loves-best/\">built on</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/middleeast/david-friedman-beit-el-west-bank.html\">private</a> Palestinian land seized by the Israeli military in the 1970s, is considered one of the most <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.765447\">politically radical</a> settlements. President Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/15/trump-tells-netanyahu-to-hold-back-on-west-bank-settlements/\">changed</a> U.S. policy by saying he does not believe a two-state solution is a necessary part of a peace deal. In a move <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/1d4e1824283f41eaa8422227fa8e6ea7/Amid-warnings,-Trump-forges-ahead-on-Jerusalem-as-capital\">expected</a> to exacerbate tensions, Trump will reportedly declare Jerusalem Israel’s capital today.</p>\n<p>The donation to Bet El came from a charitable fund “solely controlled” by Charles Kushner, Jared’s father, according to Kushner Companies spokeswoman Chris Taylor. Kushner’s White House spokesman declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Kushner stepped down from his job as CEO of Kushner Companies earlier this year but still has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/white-house-power-player-jared-kushner-keeping-parts-of-real-estate-empire\">significant</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-keeps-most-of-his-real-estate-but-offers-few-clues-about-potential-white-house-conflicts/2017/05/21/35d7ceb4-3993-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html?utm_term=.4242baf314bd\">financial interests</a> in the family empire, which mainly consists of real estate.</p>\n<p>The mood of the 1,300 attendees at the Bet El dinner, held at a midtown Manhattan Marriott Sunday, was celebratory. “2017 is a year of construction starts for Bet El Institutions,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4321291-Pages-from-Bet-El-12-3-17-dinner-book.html#document/p16\">said</a> a glossy book distributed at each table. “Facing a new policy of zero condemnations from the US State Department, Bet El is not wasting a minute.”</p>\n<p>The former president of the Bet El group, David Friedman, is now the Trump administration’s ambassador to Israel.</p>\n<p>Guests posed for pictures with a smiling John Bolton, the former Bush administration ambassador to the United Nations. A short film set to action-movie music showed high-school-age youth training in the settlement’s military academy. “Bet El is very important because it establishes our claim that God gave us this land,” said Karen Frager, an activist who spoke on a video shown on stage.</p>\n<p>Earlier Sunday, Jared Kushner made a rare public appearance in Washington, striking a different tone.</p>\n<p>“Our team has tried very hard to do a lot of listening — not just with Israelis, with Palestinians.

That effort, which was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html\">outlined</a> in the charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, came after the election but before Donald Trump was inaugurated as president.</p>\n<p>The Kushner family is associated with at least two other charitable funds, including the Charles and Seryl Kushner Foundation. A recent report in <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-disclosure-form-west-bank-settlements-israel-white-house-729290\">Newsweek</a> raised questions about whether Kushner properly disclosed his role in the nonprofits on his official ethics disclosure.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7637187.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/heather-vogell\">Heather Vogell</a> </p>\n<p>In October 2014, less than two months after entering North Augusta High School in Aiken County, South Carolina, Logan Rewis paused to drink from a fountain in the hallway between periods. As he straightened up, water fell from his mouth onto the shoe of his social studies teacher, Matt Branon, who was standing nearby. Logan says it was an accident, but Branon thought Logan had spat at him.</p>\n<p>“My bad,” the 15-year-old with bushy sandy-brown hair and blue eyes says he told Branon after the teacher confronted him.</p>\n<p>Branon, who is also the school’s baseball coach, was incensed. “Freaking disgusting,” he shouted at Logan as the teen walked away. Branon pursued Logan and grabbed the freshman by his backpack.</p>\n<p>“Get your freaking hands off me,” Logan recalls yelling. School officials say he used a different “f” word.</p>\n<p>Though Branon had arguably escalated the conflict, he wasn’t disciplined —\nbut Logan was. In a decision that changed the course of his education and life, the school district banished Logan to its alternative school, the Center for Innovative Learning at Pinecrest.</p>\n<p>The word “alternative” implies a choice. But in an era when the freedom to pick your school is trumpeted by advocates and politicians, students don’t choose the alternative schools to which districts send them for breaking the rules: They’re sentenced to them. Of 39 state education departments that responded to a ProPublica survey last year, 29, or about three-quarters, said school districts could transfer students involuntarily to alternative programs for disciplinary reasons.</p>\n<p>Like Logan, thousands of students are involuntarily reassigned to these schools each year, often for a seemingly minor offense, and never get back on track, a ProPublica investigation has found. Alternative schools are often located in crumbling buildings or trailers, with classes taught largely by computers and little in the way of counseling services or extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p>The forced placements have persisted even though the Obama administration in 2014 <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201401-title-vi.html\">told</a> schools they should suspend, expel or transfer students to alternative schools only as a last resort —\nand warned them that they risked a federal civil rights investigation if their disciplinary actions reflected discrimination based on race. Federal data shows that black and Hispanic students are often punished more than white students for similar violations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, despite legal protections afforded students with disabilities, a disproportionate number of those exiled in some districts have special education plans — like Logan, who had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other learning problems.</p>\n<p>School administrators “hang these children out to dry,” says Logan’s mother, Lisa Woodward. “They don’t want nothing else to do with them.”</p>\n<p>Now, the Trump administration is being pressed to view such removals more favorably. In November, a group of teachers and conservative education advocates <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/11/devos_criticisms_obama_student_discipline_guidance.html?r=14320560\">met with aides</a> to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to express concerns about the 2014 guidance. The group said the Obama-era approach made schools less safe, allowing disruptive students to hijack classrooms.</p>\n<p>That meeting has raised fears among civil rights advocates that the Trump administration will rescind the guidance, prompting schools to increase the number of children excluded from regular classrooms. “We’re deeply concerned this administration is not committed to protecting the civil rights of students,” says Elizabeth Olsson, senior policy associate for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. She cited reports that DeVos may scrap a rule aimed at preventing schools from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-education/2017/10/26/devos-mulled-delay-of-obama-special-ed-rule-223012\">unnecessarily placing minority students</a> in special education.</p>\n<p>A federal education spokesman on Nov. 29 declined to comment on the issue.</p>\n<p>To be sure, many students are sent to alternative schools for major offenses involving drugs, alcohol, weapons or violence. But others are forced to go for reasons that include rudeness, using their cellphones at inappropriate times, or — in about half of the states ProPublica surveyed — nondisciplinary problems such as bad grades. In states like Florida, students who fall academically have been <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alternative-education-using-charter-schools-hide-dropouts-and-game-system\">pushed to transfer</a> to alternative schools as a way to game the state’s accountability system. Pennsylvania law lets school officials relegate students to that state’s Alternative Education for Disruptive Youth program for showing “disregard for school authority.” In Aiken, about 40 percent of transfers in 2014-2015, the year Logan was reassigned, were for lesser offenses, including 13 for using profanity, 27 for truancy, 28 for not following an adult’s instructions and 18 for showing disrespect.</p>\n<p>AASA, The School Superintendents Association — which <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-groups-fighting-against-limits-on-restraining-school-kids\">has at times fiercely defended</a> local administrators’ discretion in handling disruptive students — says alternative schools should not typically be used as a disciplinary placement for non-serious offenses.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to send a student there because they didn’t take their hat off or they drank poorly from the water fountain, or they’re not as mannered as we’d like them to be,” says Bryon Joffe, the association’s project director for education and youth and development. “What we don’t want our alternative schools to be is a place to put kids we’d rather not have in class.”</p>\n<p>Aiken County Schools attorney William Burkhalter Jr. says that, under the direction of a new superintendent, Sean Alford, the school system reduced its expulsions, suspensions, and involuntary alternative school transfers in recent years. Still, district officials were acting within their rights in Logan’s case, he says. “He denies it but he spit a huge amount of water on this teacher,” says Burkhalter, who didn’t witness the incident himself. “His shoes, pant legs, whatever. It was gross.” (During a disciplinary hearing, a district official described the incident by saying: “The student spit water on a teacher's shoe as he left the water fountain.”)</p>\n<p>Burkhalter says Branon has worked for the district since 2012 without receiving any write-ups or reprimands. “The principal has had no problems and says he is a team player, a willing participant in anything he is asked to help with and a solid guy,” Burkhalter wrote in an email. He quoted the principal as saying, “‘I love having him on the staff.”</p>\n<p>Branon did not respond to emails or phone messages from ProPublica.</p>\n<p>Discipline wasn’t the original mission of alternative schools. They emerged <a href=\"http://alternatyvusisugdymas.lt/uploads/2009/12/alternative_ed_history.pdf\">in the late 1960s</a> as less competitive, more child-centered learning environments that aimed to offer flexible instruction for kids who weren’t thriving in traditional classrooms. But within two decades, their role evolved as school districts began to see them as places to warehouse students who had broken zero-tolerance policies. Under those policies, which were based on the notion that schools could only keep order by refusing to tolerate any potentially unsafe behavior, even first-time or minor incidents were more likely to result in an expulsion or suspension. When students challenged their removal, some courts ordered schools to find a place to educate them — fueling a proliferation of alternative classrooms through the 1990s and 2000s. Even as zero-tolerance policies have fallen out of fashion, involuntary placements in alternative schools for disciplinary reasons have persisted, with districts such as Miami recently introducing “success centers” for students who otherwise might have been suspended.</p>\n<p>Tasked with educating roughly half a million of the nation’s most vulnerable students, alternative schools generally lack academic rigor. Barbara Fedders, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied the schools, says some districts assign their worst teachers to alternative classrooms, and students may not even receive textbooks. “They aren’t given anything that makes schools schools,” Fedders says. “There’s no clubs, no sports.”</p>\n<p>Many students become discouraged and drop out. While just 6 percent of regular schools have graduation rates below 50 percent, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alternative-education-using-charter-schools-hide-dropouts-and-game-system\">ProPublica’s analysis</a> found, nearly half of alternative schools do.</p>\n<p>“There is an enormous change in the quality of education that the student has a shot at when they’re moved from regular school to alternative school,” says Derek Black, a University of South Carolina law professor who wrote a book on school discipline.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A middle child, Logan grew up with two sisters in North Augusta, a few miles from the Georgia border. When he was a toddler, his mother and father split up, and she married his stepfather. She worked in customer service at a car dealership; his stepfather was in construction, later taking a job as an automotive technician.</p>\n<p>Logan had little contact with his father, and his relationship with his stepfather was turbulent. When he wasn’t in school, he enjoyed swimming in nearby lakes or the Savannah River and displayed a knack for hands-on tasks. For a time, he and a friend liked to fix up and re-paint old bicycles. As he became a teenager, he wore shirts with the Polo insignia, an ever-present baseball hat and a wide smile that hinted of mischief.</p>\n<p>Because of his ADHD, which was diagnosed in third grade, Logan struggled to focus on schoolwork. He had difficulty reading and sometimes acted impulsively. He could get boisterous, wasn’t great at following directions and mouthed off to adults who called him out in front of peers. He took medicine for his attention disorder for several years, but Woodward stopped it when he was in seventh grade because she thought the side effects made him act up more.</p>\n<p>He was repeatedly disciplined for outbursts in class, disrespect, swearing, silliness and horsing around with other students. As the incidents piled up, Logan became acquainted with the district’s alternative school, the Center for Innovative Learning at Pinecrest. Located a couple of miles from downtown Aiken, the low-slung brick building has long grass, a chain-link fence and a “No Trespassing” sign out back. With a fluctuating enrollment that sometimes exceeds 200 students in grades three and up, the center sits in a neighborhood beset by crime, with pockets of boarded up homes and unkempt yards.</p>\n<p>In sixth grade, school officials sent Logan to Pinecrest for more than two months after he was accused of pushing another student. The next year, he returned for about a month for repeatedly forgetting his gym clothes. His grades suffered each time.</p>\n<p>For high school, his mother thought he should go to a small charter school, where he could receive individualized attention, rather than North Augusta. One of Aiken’s larger high schools, North Augusta has 1,500 students and a sprawling campus in an older subdivision dotted with midcentury brick ranch homes. But Logan assured her he would be fine. He was already planning to pursue a vocational track after his freshman year and had his eye on a welding program. As he left middle school, educators created an Individualized Education Program for him that, among other things, said teachers at North Augusta should first remind him of the rules and give him a chance to comply before issuing a citation and should avoid embarrassing him by criticizing him in public.</p>\n<p>Logan’s first couple of months at North Augusta went relatively well. He made B’s in Algebra 1 and mostly kept out of trouble. He did rack up tardies, repeatedly failing to get from one end of the school to the other in time for class. Another teacher chastised him for saying he didn’t have a book when he actually did. But his mother had met with his teachers and they all talked with Logan about hurrying up. He promised to.</p>\n<p>Then came the water fountain incident. Afterwards, an assistant principal called Woodward, telling her Logan had spat on a teacher and could be arrested for assault if charges were pressed. “I was like, ‘What in the world has happened to my child?’” she recalls. “Because it’s not out of character for him to mouth off at somebody, but for him to spit on somebody, that was out of character.” She was so upset she hardly spoke to Logan on the drive home. That night, he fled from the house and wandered their working-class neighborhood alone, while she anxiously waited up.</p>\n<p>When they finally talked over what happened, Woodward says she was crestfallen. “It broke my heart that I had reacted the way I did,” she says.</p>\n<p>The school referred Logan’s case to a disciplinary tribunal, a group of retired educators who determined punishment for violations of the district’s code of conduct. Branon went to great lengths to bolster his account, collecting statements from nine students about the incident. Most agreed that Logan spat on the shoe of “Coach Branon,” but couldn’t say for sure whether it was intentional.</p>\n<p>At a hearing a few days later, Woodward pleaded for leniency.</p>\n<p>“He has progressively gotten better,” Woodward told tribunal members, according to a recording of the hearing obtained by ProPublica. “He's not a bad kid, he's a good kid.” But the chairwoman told Logan his behavior would not be tolerated. “You ain't never going to win being disrespectful to people in charge,” the chairwoman told Logan. The preponderance of evidence supported that he spat and cursed at the teacher, she said as the hearing closed, but even “if you didn't, then it's a lesson that giving the impression that you did sometimes can be just as painful as if you did it. You got it?” She warned him that if he came back before the tribunal for another offense, it would likely expel him.</p>\n<p>The panel sentenced him to a short-term stint at Pinecrest, which is usually four to five weeks. However, while Woodward was registering him at the alternative school, she says school officials at his old high school met to talk about his IEP without her. At this meeting, despite the tribunal’s recommendation, school officials decided Logan should stay at Pinecrest longer — for at least nine to 10 weeks. “He was doing so good, then because of this little incident that they blew out of proportion, they basically kicked him while he was down,” Woodward says.</p>\n<p>School administrators “did not feel the mother ever understood what they were putting up with and how much they wanted Logan to succeed,” attorney Burkhalter says.</p>\n<p>Pinecrest was much smaller than North Augusta High, and Logan knew some of the other students there. His mother usually drove him, even though the route took her an hour out of her way and she feared jeopardizing her job at the dealership.</p>\n<p>The Center for Innovative Learning was anything but. While the small classes at Pinecrest took pressure off Logan, he wasn’t learning much. His computer-based courses in social studies and science required him to absorb screens and screens of text. “There was a lot of stuff to read and I wasn’t really good at reading,” he recalls. Some kids figured out a way to get around the school’s academic software to surf outside websites, such as Facebook, he says. Other classes taught by teachers were too easy for a high school freshman, he says — his math class spent the period doing multiplication with calculators.</p>\n<p>“They didn’t teach me anything at all,” Logan says. His grades in the computer-based courses tanked.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>States and school districts have created a patchwork of rules on who should attend public alternative schools and why. Some set a higher bar than others. In Delaware, students must face expulsion or “seriously” violate the district discipline code before being sent to alternative programs. In Austin, Texas, students who commit one of a list of offenses — including felonies, assaults with injuries and marijuana or alcohol possession — must be transferred to alternative classrooms.</p>\n<p>Miami-Dade County Public Schools turned to alternative schools after facing pressure from parents and activists to reduce the number of students it suspends and expels. In 2015, the district opened 10 “Student Success Centers” for students who in the past would have been sent home on suspension. Under the district’s plan, such students would report to the centers and receive schoolwork from their teachers — so they didn’t fall behind — along with character education and counseling, if needed. The move dramatically reduced the number of off-campus suspensions. But <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article83033207.html\">news media</a> and civil rights advocates soon reported that many students weren’t showing up at the success centers or, if they did, schoolwork from their current classes often didn’t arrive. “Student Success Centers are out-of-school suspensions by another name,” the Advancement Project and a student advocacy group said about their findings in an <a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-dade-schools-off-campus-detention-centers-fail-to-educate-students-report-finds-9771355\">October report</a>.</p>\n<p>A Miami-Dade district spokesman said the centers have improved as a result of recommendations from a task force that includes administrators, teachers, counselors and parent-teacher groups. “We will continue to use feedback from all stakeholders to inform decisions,” the spokesman wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the formal eligibility rules for alternative schools, local officials are commonly afforded wide discretion. That, critics say, allows bias to creep in.</p>\n<p>In Pennsylvania, <a href=\"http://www.elc-pa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ELC_DOJ_AEDYComplaint_8_7_13.pdf\">a complaint</a> filed by education advocates with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division in 2013 alleges the state’s alternative schools are substandard educationally and disproportionately composed of students who have disabilities or are African American. The percentage of students with disabilities sent to the state’s alternative programs was nearly triple the state average — making up 44 percent of the alternative population in the 2012 school year, according to the complaint, which is pending. In 82 Pennsylvania school districts, disabled students made up half or more of the alternative population, with one district assigning only disabled students to the programs. Between 2008 and 2011, African-American students were placed in alternative programs at a rate more than double that of the general student population.</p>\n<p>Charges of bias in alternative placements have also surfaced in the largest school district in Mississippi — DeSoto County Schools just south of the Tennessee border. Cynthia Lewis says that her daughter A’riauna McMillian’s involuntary transfer to an alternative school last school year in DeSoto County was an unduly harsh punishment that set the African-American teen back academically.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of her freshman year, A’riauna told ProPublica, she took out her cellphone while in the ladies’ room to use the Snapchat app. Then she dangled the phone over a stall she thought was occupied by a friend she had been goofing around with. The phone’s light flashed as a warning that it was about to start recording. A’riauna’s friend noticed it and yelled that she was in a different stall. A’riauna says she snatched her phone back and started hitting delete, just in case. When the girl in the stall, who was white, came out, A’riauna let her look at the phone — and scroll through A’riauna’s Snapchat feed — to check that nothing was posted or saved. The girl complained to administrators anyway.</p>\n<p>A’riauna was a good student who had never been in trouble before. The school not only suspended her for three days but also referred her to a disciplinary hearing to consider additional punishment. The hearing officer ordered A’riauna to spend 30 school days in the district’s alternative school for “acts which threaten the safety or well-being of others,” “possession or use of obscene, immoral, or offensive materials” and three lesser offenses, including having a cellphone. Lewis says the district’s code doesn’t recommend an alternative placement for a first offense on such a charge. “I felt like they were railroading her,” says Lewis, who has worked as a bus driver and substitute teacher for the district. She worried her daughter would fall behind in biology and English — classes that had mandatory state tests that spring.</p>\n<p>When A’riauna entered the DeSoto County Alternative Center that fall, she was scared. “It was like, ‘Oh my God Ma, it’s like they’re in prison,’” she told Lewis. She was subjected to pat-downs each morning that included being required to shake her bra to show she wasn’t carrying contraband. She told her mother that on most days she would do worksheets and spend much of the rest of her time coloring pictures with crayons and markers. When her stint at the alternative center was over, her mother moved her to another high school, fearing that her old one wouldn’t treat her fairly. A’riauna found she needed extra help from teachers to get back on track. The transition was difficult. “She was very depressed in the beginning,” her mother says. With teachers’ help and hard work, she managed to raise her grades, Lewis says.</p>\n<p>Working with the Advancement Project, the same group that criticized the Miami Success Centers, Lewis and other DeSoto parents have filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. “The punishments A’riauna received were harsher than and inconsistent with those allowed by District policy,” her mother wrote in the complaint. The parents say DeSoto’s overwhelmingly white administration and school board have routinely meted out harsher punishments to black students than white students who commit similar offenses. The complaints are pending.</p>\n<p>Katherine Nelson, a spokeswoman for the school district, which has about 34,000 students, declined to discuss A’riauna’s experience or the parents’ complaints about bias. “We cannot discuss student discipline issues,” she said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s little available data comparing how often students of different races are sent to alternative schools for the same offense. But federal data from 2012 documents racial bias in suspending students for lesser offenses, according to Joffe, of the superintendents’ association. In the 5 percent of offenses that would be considered most serious — when punishments were mandatory under state law or rule because they involved drugs, alcohol, weapons or violence — students of different races were treated similarly, Joffe says. But in the larger pool of offenses, for which officials had more discretion in deciding whether to suspend students, their decisions revealed vast racial disparities. “We know children of color face discipline more often and, more importantly, more harshly for the same sorts of infractions than their white and Asian peers,” Joffe says.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration has told educators to avoid overly punitive responses to misbehavior by disabled students, too. In <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/files/dcl-on-pbis-in-ieps--08-01-2016.pdf\">a letter to educators in 2016</a>, it said that repeated disciplining of children with disabilities may signal that they are not receiving appropriate support in school.</p>\n\n<aside>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n</aside><p>Regular schools should have “release valves” for students who disturb classes — such as sending them to a guidance counselor’s office or giving them in-school suspension — that don’t involve removing them from regular school, Joffe says. Alternative schools should be reserved for students who need services beyond what a regular school can offer, he says — such as substance abuse treatment, anger management or trauma counseling.</p>\n<p>In recent years, facing criticism for excluding students, some schools have turned to gentler approaches for managing disruptive behavior. One method, called “positive behavior supports,” involves coaching students to improve behavior through rewards, encouragement and changes in their environment and routines. Restorative justice, in which students make amends for bad behavior in lieu of harsh punishment, has also gained proponents.</p>\n<p>The Aiken school district — which serves roughly 25,000 students, about a third of whom are African American — has not formally adopted either positive behavior supports or restorative justice. But the district has reformed both its code of conduct and the tribunal system in the past two years, with Superintendent <a href=\"http://www.wrdw.com/content/news/Student-discipline-biggest-concern-for-parents-at-town-hall-meeting-414059246.html\">Alford telling parents</a> discipline should be instructive and not simply punitive. Because of the changes, fewer offenses result in automatic referrals for severe punishment. And school administrators now must first document what they did to try to help a child correct misbehavior before referring them for expulsion, suspension or an alternative school transfer. The district hired a full-time hearing officer, who has taken the place of the tribunal and has more flexibility in working with families after a disciplinary incident. The goal, Burkhalter says, was to reduce expulsions, decrease the number of hearings and appeals and give school administrators and teachers more discretion in handling discipline problems “with a view toward trying to get students back on track and not trying to push them out the door.”</p>\n<p>While the number of students in Pinecrest has remained about the same, Burkhalter says, more of them arrive as a result of negotiated agreements between parents and the district after a disciplinary incident. Overall, he says, students are spending fewer days out of school altogether for disciplinary reasons —\nresulting in fewer lost instructional hours.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When he returned to North Augusta after 13 weeks at Pinecrest, Logan found himself far behind peers. “I don’t know any of this, you are way further ahead of me,” he told his math teacher. “I wasn’t doing anything like this in alternative school.” A few weeks later, Logan got caught taking his cellphone out of his pocket twice on one day — though students were supposed to leave it in their locker or a car. This time, the school recommended expulsion and held a special hearing to decide whether the violations stemmed from his disability — which would have precluded the drastic punishment. Though his mom argued that taking out his cellphone was an impulsive act directly connected to his ADHD, staff disagreed. Woodward and her son didn’t bother presenting their case at the tribunal. They had had enough. Feeling defeated, Logan dropped out of high school in the spring of 2015, at age 15.</p>\n<p>At the time, Logan told himself and his mother that he’d just get an equivalency diploma or attend a special school for at-risk kids in Columbia. Instead, he started working right away, moving down to south Georgia to build chicken houses for his uncle’s company, which supplies them to farms. After a few months, he moved back home, taking another job repairing heating and air conditioning units — and sometimes working 55- to 60-hour weeks. His family moved across town to a subdivision, where they live in a neat brick home with a manicured lawn at the end of a cul-de-sac. Logan contributed $100 of his pay each week to household expenses.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171205-alt-schools-choice-work-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171205-alt-schools-choice-work-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171205-alt-schools-choice-work-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171205-alt-schools-choice-work-3x2.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171205-alt-schools-choice-work-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Logan Rewis operates a forklift at his uncle's business in rural Georgia. <span>(Travis Dove for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>On his days off, he shot skeet or hunted deer with family and friends or went down to the drag strip to watch the races. He reached out to his father, who had fallen on hard times. The two met and started to develop a relationship. But this time, his mother says, Logan tried to be the role model, urging his father to face his problems.</p>\n<p>“He fell into adulthood,” Woodward says. “He’s just taken it and run with it.”</p>\n<p>In late November, Logan decided to move back to South Georgia and join his uncle’s company, repairing the equipment in the chicken houses. He is living with his cousin near rural Reidsville, making $14 an hour. “He’s a hard worker, I think that’s what he’s got going for him,” his aunt, Dawn Floyd, says. “We couldn’t wait for him to get to us.”</p>\n<p>Woodward says she’s proud of her son’s determination since he left school, but she still grieves that he will likely never hold a traditional high school diploma and missed out on high school rituals like the class ring ceremony, graduation and prom. “I think it hurts me more than it hurt him,” she says.</p>\n<p>The weekend he left South Carolina for Georgia was emotional. Afterward, his mother sent him a text, telling him his younger sister missed him.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t easy for him either, Logan texted back, but he was determined to succeed, for all their sakes. “I’m going to be a millionaire,” he wrote, so that “we won’t have to struggle ever again.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7635681.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/topher-sanders\">Topher Sanders</a>, ProPublica, and <span>Benjamin Conarck</span>, Florida Times-Union </p>\n<p>Jacksonville, Fl. — Several local lawmakers and civil rights organizations have called for the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office to suspend all pedestrian ticket writing over concerns officers are targeting blacks and other residents of the city’s poorer neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Isaiah Rumlin, president of the local chapter of the NAACP, and Reverend Levy Wilcox of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s local branch, said in a news release made public Tuesday that while public safety was a great concern, so was the possibility that the sheriff’s office had been discriminating against African Americans by selectively enforcing sometimes obscure pedestrian statutes.</p>\n<p>The calls from the civil rights organizations come two weeks after the Times-Union and ProPublica <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/walking-while-black/jacksonville-pedestrian-violations-racial-profiling/\">reported</a> that a disproportionate number of the more than 2,200 pedestrian tickets issued from 2012 to 2017 had been given to blacks. Those tickets, issued for everything from jaywalking to walking on the wrong side of the road, can have an impact on people’s driver’s licenses and, if unpaid, their credit ratings.</p>\n<p>In the last five years, according to an analysis by the Times-Union and ProPublica, blacks received 55 percent of all pedestrian tickets in Jacksonville, while only making up 29 percent of the population. Blacks receive a higher percentage of tickets in Duval County than any other large county in Florida. Blacks in Jacksonville were nearly three times as likely as whites to be ticketed for a pedestrian violation. Residents of the city’s three poorest ZIP codes were about six times as likely to receive a pedestrian citation as those living in the city’s other, more affluent 34 ZIP codes.</p>\n<p>Tickets for some of the less well-known pedestrian statutes were issued even more disproportionately to blacks. Seventy-eight percent of all tickets written for “walking in the roadway where sidewalks are provided” were issued to blacks.  As well, blacks were issued 68 percent of all tickets for “failing to cross the road at a right angle or shortest route.”</p>\n<p>While the sheriff’s office said tickets were primarily written to help limit deadly accidents in a city with dangerously high numbers of fatal crashes, the analysis showed there is no strong relationship between where tickets are being issued and where pedestrians are being killed.        </p>\n<p>Williams said last month that there was no effort to target African Americans, and his office argued that the racial breakdown of those receiving tickets was merely a reflection of who was committing the violations. The sheriff’s office also said the tickets could be a useful tool for fighting crime. Stopping people for pedestrian violations, the office said, gave officers probable cause to question and sometimes search individuals suspected of having drugs or weapons.</p>\n<p>Ben Frazier, a spokesman for the Northside Coalition, a community advocacy group, said in a statement that the authorities “should stop tap dancing around the truth,” and admit officers were engaging in “racially discriminatory police tactics.”</p>\n<p>“The numbers don’t lie,” Frazier said.</p>\n<p>Frazier said he had sent a letter to Mayor Lenny Curry expressing the same concern. Curry responded to the letter with an email saying he was confident Williams had seen the analysis and would take any action necessary.</p>\n<p>Asked about the calls for suspending the pedestrian ticket enforcement, a spokeswoman for the mayor said:</p>\n<p>“As the sheriff and his team continue their review of data and enforcement of policies within the JSO organization, the mayor will continue to work with them on efforts they are leading to build and improve public safety and public trust.” </p>\n<p>City Councilman Reggie Brown said Tuesday that he and state Rep. Kim Daniels had met with the sheriff shortly after the ticket analysis was published. Daniels is interested in pursuing legislation that would require warnings be issued before any ticket is written, according to Brown. Brown said Daniels also wanted to review policies governing the suspension of driver’s licenses. Pedestrian tickets, both paid and unpaid, can lead to penalties on one’s license.</p>\n<p>The Times-Union/ProPublica analysis showed hundreds of tickets for failing to cross the street in a crosswalk were given in error. It is possible officers simply didn’t understand the applicable statute. Williams told the Times-Union and ProPublica that he had asked the local state attorney to give his office guidance on the proper enforcement of the statute.</p>\n<p>Both the sheriff and the mayor have said the primary goal of the tickets is saving lives. However, despite a sustained effort at enforcing pedestrian statutes, the number of pedestrians killed each year in Jacksonville has gone up.</p>\n<p>Williams appeared before a city council committee on Monday, and sought to reassure lawmakers that African Americans were not being targeted.</p>\n<p>“We base our enforcement on traffic complaints from citizens or data,” he said. “We don’t have ticket quotas.”</p>\n<p>Williams, though, said he thought it was wise for his office to examine its operations “to make sure that we’re doing things the right way.”</p>\n<p>“We want to do that and we’re committed to doing that,” Williams said. “And every citation that we issue has got to be correct.”</p>\n<p>Still, two members of the city council, Brown and Garrett Dennis, said in the news release Tuesday that they supported the idea of suspending the writing of pedestrian tickets until the issue of disproportionate enforcement against African Americans had been addressed.</p>\n<p>“The racially disproportionate ticket writing statistics are troubling,” Dennis said. He called the idea of suspending the ticket writing “a reasonable request.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7629245.gif\" height=\"1\">",

But online political ads are often seen only by a small target audience — making it difficult for the public to check them for accuracy. In order to shine a light on political advertising on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online\">we built a</a> tool that allows Facebook users to automatically send us the political ads that were displayed on their news feeds. (You can install the tool, known as a web browser extension, for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-political-ad-col/enliecaalhkhhihcmnbjfmmjkljlcinl\">Chrome</a> or <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-ad-collector/\">Firefox</a>.)</p>\n<p>The extension, which we call the Political Ad Collector, is a small piece of software that users can add to their web browsers. When a user logs into Facebook, the extension will collect the ads displayed on the user’s news feed and guess which ones are political based on an algorithm built by ProPublica. Ads that are found likely to be political are made public in a <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/\">searchable database</a>.</p>\n<p>Our tool collects basic information about each ad, such as the Facebook ad identification number and the dates we saw the ad in our system. However, to protect the privacy of users, we automatically remove any personally identifiable information from the ads we collect, including Facebook ID numbers and tracking identifiers, which are tiny images that can be used to identify users. We also remove the names and profile links of the user's friends who have liked the ad and any comments on the ad.</p>\n<p>We collect targeting information that Facebook provides with the ad, but we do not connect that information to any data that could be used to identify a user. The targeting data tells users some of the criteria used to decide which ads to display to which user, such as age and location. Facebook users can see targeting information if they click the dots at the top right corner of any Facebook ad and select “Why am I seeing this?”</p>\n<p>To determine which ads are political, ProPublica built a machine-learning algorithm to calculate the statistical likelihood that an ad contains political content. This algorithm, called a Naive Bayes classifier, has long been used for identifying spam emails. It works particularly well on classifying text into one of two groups, such as spam or not spam, or, in this case, political and not political.</p>\n<p>Before we launched the tool, we trained this algorithm on a list of Facebook posts that we knew were political — posts from parties and candidates, and posts about political issues — and a list of posts that weren’t political — published by big stores and other companies.</p>\n<p>If we relied solely on these initial hand-selected posts, our classifier would have been able to reliably find ads published by the Democratic or Republican parties, but it would have missed ads from groups that we didn’t include in our training data. It also would miss how politically charged language and subjects change over time.</p>\n<p>So, for our algorithm to distinguish more accurately between political and non-political ads, our tool regularly shows users a selection of ads and asks them to identify which ones they think are political and which ones they think aren’t. These include the ads that appeared on the user’s own feed as well as ads that were shown to other people. Just because a single user tells us an ad is non-political doesn’t mean it will get dropped from our database of political ads, but the algorithm will take that vote into account.</p>\n<p>The tool is already being used in several countries, including Germany, Italy, Australia, Austria and the U.S. For each country, we customize the the algorithm to learn to identify political content. The <a href=\"https://github.com/propublica/facebook-political-ads\">open source code</a> behind our project is available to the public.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7628663.gif\" height=\"1\">",

The pitch designed to lure President Donald Trump’s critics is one of more than a dozen politically themed advertisements masking consumer rip-offs that ProPublica has identified since launching an effort in September to monitor paid political messages on the world’s largest social network. As the American public becomes ever more polarized along partisan lines, swindlers who used to capitalize on curiosity about celebrities or sports are now exploiting political passions.</p>\n<p>“Those political ads, especially right now if you look at the U.S., they are actually getting more clicks,” said Jérôme Segura, lead malware intelligence analyst at anti-malware company Malwarebytes. “Where there are clicks, there is going to be interest from bad guys.”</p>\n<p>The ads, supplied by ProPublica readers through our Political Ad Collector <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online\">tool</a>, lured Facebook viewers with provocative statements about hot-button figures such as former President Barack Obama, Ivanka Trump, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity and presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway.</p>\n<p>Clicking on <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/?search=Sponsors+Pull+out+From+His+Show+Over+This+toknowthedrill.com\">the headline</a>, “Sponsors Pull out From His Show Over This?” — over a photo of Hannity with MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow — led to a page styled to look like the Fox News website. It offered a free bottle of Testo-Max HD, which it described as a cure for erectile dysfunction, although it isn’t approved by the FDA. People who sign up for such free nostrums are typically asked to provide credit card information to pay for shipping and are then automatically charged almost $100 a month, according to reviews online.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-hannity-crop01.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-hannity-crop01.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-hannity-crop01.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-hannity-crop01.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Another ad we collected led people to a webpage styled to look like the Fox News site. The scam site falsely said commentator Sean Hannity was hawking free trials of a pill called Testo-Max HD, which it claimed could cure erectile dysfunction.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Although these scams represent only a tiny fraction of the more than 8,000 politically themed advertisements assembled by the Political Ad Collector, they raise doubts about Facebook’s ability to monitor paid political messages. In each case, the ads ran afoul of guidelines Facebook has developed to curb misleading and malicious advertising. Many of the scams had also been flagged by users, fact-checking groups and cybersecurity services — even the Federal Trade Commission — long before they appeared on the social network.</p>\n<p>Moreover, most of the sites may have warranted special attention because they had been registered within the 30 days before users sent them to our Political Ad Collector. Paul Vixie, the co-founder of San Mateo, California-based computer security company Farsight Security, said new website domains are more likely to be shady, because fraudsters often shut sites down after days or even minutes and open new ones to stay ahead of authorities looking to catch them.</p>\n<p>As the midterm elections heat up, such cons are likely to proliferate, along with more devious forms of information warfare. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg recently said in <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-interview-facebook-sheryl-sandberg-2495538841.html\">an interview</a> with Axios that the social network had missed “more subtle” election interference in part because its security team had been focused on “the biggest threats” of malware and phishing — tricking people into revealing their personal information. Based on ProPublica’s findings, it’s unclear if the world’s largest social network can handle either challenge.</p>\n<p>Facebook officials told ProPublica that the company is trying to improve its ability to stop harmful advertising, including malware and frauds, but is aware some bad ads get through its defenses. “There is no tolerable amount of malware on the site. The tolerance is zero, but unfortunately that’s not the same as zero occurrence,” said Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president of ads. Goldman said of the 14 deceptive ads ProPublica identified, 12 were removed by Facebook before ProPublica contacted the company in November. Facebook took down the other two after ProPublica alerted it to the ads.</p>\n<p>He declined to identify the specific tools, such as computer virus databases or popular fact-checking website Snopes.com, that Facebook uses to inspect ads. “It’s bad if the bad guys learn how we enforce,” he said.</p>\n<p>To be sure, malicious advertising — also called “malvertising” — likely will never be stopped fully, several cybersecurity researchers said. Segura said other internet ad companies, not just Facebook, showed similar lapses by letting such ads through. Still, the persistence of these ads on Facebook suggests the company doesn’t have adequate oversight in place to stop problematic ads before they run.</p>\n<p>Malvertising tactics that have been reported publicly, “should be dealt with and done,” Segura said. Instead, they continue to show up — including in the Facebook ads collected by ProPublica — indicating that “the core issue hasn’t been addressed,” he said.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Facebook has been reluctant to manually review ads before they show up on its platform. In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104052907253171\">recent video announcement</a> outlining the company’s response to misleading political ads from Russia during the 2016 election, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated that stance. “Most ads are bought programmatically through our apps and website without an advertiser ever speaking to someone at Facebook,” he said. He can’t guarantee, he added, that Facebook will “catch all bad content” in its system. “We don’t check what people say before they say it and frankly, I don’t think society should want us to. Freedom means you don’t have to ask permission first, and that by default you can say what you want.”</p>\n<p>Under pressure from its users and lawmakers, Facebook has said it is trying to become more proactive, instituting rules to evaluate ads and posts and block or limit those it deems misleading.</p>\n<p>The social networking giant has long had rules against fraudulent ads and those that lead people to “any software that results in an unexpected or deceptive experience.” Last year, it rolled out a policy to prevent “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/low_quality_or_disruptive_experiences\">low quality or disruptive content</a>” providers from placing ads, saying that ads should “link to landing pages that include significant and original content that is relevant” to the ad, and that they should not &quot;include deceptive ad copy that incentivizes people to click.” In May, <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/reducing-links-to-low-quality-web-page-experiences/\">Facebook announced</a> it had stepped up measures against “<a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/reducing-links-to-low-quality-web-page-experiences/\">misleading, sensational and spammy</a>” ads and posts. The company said it had used artificial intelligence to figure out which new pages shared on Facebook were likely to be low quality, which the company defined as having “little substantive content” or a lot of shocking or scammy ads. If its algorithms determined a post was likely to link to that sort of web page, it said, the post “may not be eligible” to be used in advertising.</p>\n<p>Since 2014, Facebook has also intensified its efforts to <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/news-feed-fyi-new-updates-to-reduce-clickbait-headlines/\">crack down</a> on so-called “clickbait,” which <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/news-feed-fyi-further-reducing-clickbait-in-feed/\">it says</a> includes “headlines that intentionally leave out crucial information, or mislead people, forcing people to click to find out the answer.”</p>\n<p>All the consumer rip-off ads recorded by ProPublica violated one or more of these rules.</p>\n<p>It is unclear how many people have been cheated by such ads on Facebook. ProPublica’s sample is not random or representative, and the vast majority of politically themed ads ProPublica saw were legitimate. But what seems like a small annoyance for the social network can be a big headache for hundreds or thousands of people. For example, Facebook recently <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-31-17%2520Stretch%2520Testimony.pdf\">told lawmakers</a> that only about 0.004 percent of the content on its news feed from June 2015 to August 2017 was related to the Russian Internet Research Agency’s influence campaign — but that meant 126 million Americans may have seen such items.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Facebook scams are the latest in a long line of deceptive campaigns using digital ad technology, said Robyn Caplan, a researcher who studies algorithms and media at the New York-based Data &amp; Society Research Institute.</p>\n<p>They are “building off of really well-worn techniques with advertising in the ’90s,” she said. At that time, scammers started using techniques to manipulate search engine algorithms and promote their own pages. “Clickbait” and similar tactics arose as a way to entice web users.</p>\n<p>On Facebook, though, hucksters can take their manipulation to the next level because the company gathers so much data about people and allows advertisers to target messages based on that data. So scammers can ensure their clickbait is seen by the people they think are most likely to fall for their outrageous headlines.</p>\n<p>The political scam ads identified by ProPublica had certain traits in common. At least seven were associated with a scheme that sends readers to a web page containing a snippet of malicious computer code, or malware, to lock up the user’s computer. Those included the ad featuring Trump’s approval rating, as well as ones headlined “<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/?search=Sponsors+Pull+out+From+His+Show+Over+This+toknowthedrill.com\">Ivanka Trump Has Actually Responded to Her Dad’s ‘Incestuous Comments’ About Her</a>” — which were also targeted at “very liberal” people over 40 — and “<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/?search=This+Barack+Obama+Quote+About+Donald+Trump+Is+Absolutely+Terrifying+superminds.info\">This Barack Obama Quote About Donald Trump Is Absolutely Terrifying</a>,” for which we couldn’t identify the target audience.</p>\n<p>Typically, after their computers are frozen, users are instructed to call a toll-free number. Our calls to that number in the weeks after the ads ran went unanswered, but people who track this particular hoax say the perpetrators usually ask for money or login information to fix the person’s machine.</p>\n<p>These attacks, known as “tech support scams,” have been a common problem for several years, said Will Maxson, the assistant director of the division of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission who has been fighting them since 2013.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-tech-support.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-tech-support.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-tech-support.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-tech-support.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-tech-support.jpg\">\n<figcaption>When Facebook users clicked on some of these fraudulent ads, they were taken to a page with a snippet of malicious computer code, or malware, to freeze their computers. They were then instructed to call a number for tech support, even though they could have unlocked the screen by simply restarting the computer.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Maxson said when he started, the scammers called potential victims on the phone and claimed to be from Microsoft or Apple. They have since also adopted more sophisticated techniques, including the computer-locking code seen by ProPublica.</p>\n<p>We couldn’t figure out who was behind the tech support scams we found. The accounts used fake names such as Facts WorldWide and News Express. Website registrations for the sites used in the ads, which had addresses such as poolparty9.info and factsforyou.info, used a service that masked the actual address. Clues on one related site and in the malicious code pointed to people in India, but such details can be easy to fake, and attempts to contact the people went unanswered.</p>\n<p>Facebook isn’t the only company to have overlooked the tech support scam. The ad about Trump’s approval rating used a known flaw in web-browsing software that can be exploited to eat up all available memory, making the computer freeze. This browser vulnerability was <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=394296\">first reported</a> in 2014 and has been used by tech-support fraudsters for about a year, Segura, the malware researcher, said. But Safari and Microsoft’s newest browser, Edge, were the only ones with a fix when the ads ran. A spokesman for Google, which makes the Chrome browser, said the company had introduced an “initial patch” for the bug in September but was still working on improving protections against the flaw. A spokesman for Mozilla, which makes the Firefox browser, said the organization plans to fix the problem in an upcoming version.</p>\n<p>Even if this flaw were fixed, there are other vulnerabilities that tech support fraudsters commonly use to lock up computers, such as trapping a user in a pop-up screen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To hide their activities from Facebook’s automated scanning tools, almost all of the scammers used a technique called cloaking. Typically, cloaking involves running bad content only at certain times or to selected audiences, redirecting some people to a separate website, or automatically altering the content depending on who is looking. In August, Facebook issued a <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/08/news-feed-fyi-addressing-cloaking-so-people-see-more-authentic-posts/\">press release</a> detailing how the company was using artificial intelligence to uncover cloaking.</p>\n<p>One version of the ad about Trump’s approval ratings sent users to a site named poolparty9.info. When we first saw it on Sept. 25, that site automatically funneled many users to another site — more-updates.tech — which had the bad code to lock up their machines. When we rechecked the ad later, poolparty9.info was blank and didn’t send people anywhere else. Presumably, computer security experts told us, poolparty9 would have kept any Facebook scanners it detected on the same blank page, rather than referring them to more-updates.tech.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-ivanka.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-ivanka.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-ivanka.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-ivanka.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The shady ads we saw used outrageous headlines about political figures to lure people to click. Facebook said all the ads violated at least one of its policies, including those against fraud and malware.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Cloaking also protected a set of <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/?search=Conway+Caught\">ads</a> proclaiming that Kellyanne Conway was leaving the White House. The reasons for her departure given in the linked article changed depending on the user’s choice of browser. In Firefox, the site said she quit her job to sell Allura Skin cream, but when an automated internet archiving service — similar to a tool that a company like Facebook might employ to scan ads —visited the same site, the story merely said Conway had left, and didn’t say what she planned to do.</p>\n<p>ProPublica’s tool collected at least five different versions of the Conway-related ad. They linked to sites such as cashmillionaire.info and jumping-jimmies.info, which were registered using the email address freemoneyteam@hotmail.com, according to DomainTools, a Seattle-based computer forensics service. These sites encourage visitors to sign up for a free trial of skin cream and ask for credit card information to pay only for shipping. But consumers are then charged nearly $100 automatically for each small vial of cream, according to Snopes.</p>\n<p>Cloaking is supposed to trick companies like Facebook by showing them legitimate websites and pages. But in these cases, even the sites that were supposed to pass inspection actually violated Facebook’s rules against clickbait and low-quality content and could have indicated to Facebook that something was amiss.</p>\n<p>Many of the decoy sites offered outlandish or false information. For example, another version of the Trump ad sent people to liveyourpassion9.info, which offered content such as “10 Fantastic and Bizarre Caterpillar Facts” and “10 Most Bizarre Planets You’ve Probably Never Heard Of.”</p>\n<p>Most of the ads affiliated with the scam that locked people’s computers included links to Facebook pages, not just outside websites. While these Facebook pages may have been intended to enhance credibility, they typically posted either almost no content, or content that was just copied from elsewhere on the web. Many of the Facebook pages and the outside websites used for cloaking featured similar teasers, such as “GET ALL THE LATEST FACTS ALL OVER THE WORLD.” A Google search for that phrase turns up a handful of dubious Facebook pages and outside websites operating since June, suggesting that the scam was rolling months before ProPublica saw the ads this fall.</p>\n<p>In addition, several of the decoy websites were associated with computer servers known to be problematic. DomainTools gave several of them a “risk score” that indicates they are worth further security review. One was <a href=\"https://fortiguard.com/webfilter?q=dailynewsplanet.tk\">classified as actively dangerous</a> by an antivirus company nearly a month before ProPublica’s tool saw the ad.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Facebook failed to unveil the cloaking and detect the flimflams despite many prior specific warnings about the ads. Most notably, the Conway scam had been reported in May by Snopes, with which Facebook has partnered in an effort to block advertising by purveyors of fake news. Snopes found an overwhelming number of almost identical advertisements that falsely claimed Conway and other celebrities had started careers in skin care. Snopes <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2017/05/26/skin-care-free-trial/\">pointed out</a> that the free trials of skin care products could actually cost consumers almost $100. The Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/10/ftc-obtains-court-orders-barring-skincare-marketers-deceptive\">has fined advertisers</a> for similar behavior.</p>\n<p>A Facebook page associated with another ad carried more than 100 comments from users warning that this was “fake fake fake” and “clearly a scam!,” including comments posted weeks before ProPublica gathered the ad. This ad, aimed at users who were over 18 and had recently been in Switzerland, trumpeted, “Anonymous shocks Donald Trump by revealing system which made him rich!” The advertisers claimed to offer access to a stock-trading scheme promoted by the hacker collective Anonymous. They sought a minimum deposit of $250 and said “our system will quadruple this in just 24 hours.” They described their “system” as “limited to binary options,” a scheme that involves betting on whether a stock or commodity will go above or below a certain price. <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/binary-options-fraud\">The FBI cited</a> binary options earlier this year as a common vehicle for identity theft and other fraud.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-anonymous.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-anonymous.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-anonymous.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-facebook-ad-scams-anonymous.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Advertisers who trumpeted “Anonymous shocks Donald Trump by revealing system which made him rich!” offered access to what they portrayed as a stock-trading tool promoted by the hacker collective Anonymous.

This should be checked before actually sending this to people,” one Facebook user complained.</p>\n<p>The audio file used in the Trump approval ad and other tech support scams to tell people that their computers were infected was flagged as a cybersecurity risk <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/52e084c2836617708ea42c253edef94c397410f35b023bf94dc34fbc0f9a0545/detection\">over a year ago</a>. And one of the sites hosting the bad code, more-updates.tech, had been <a href=\"https://fortiguard.com/webfilter?q=more-updates.tech\">marked as malicious</a> by a widely used service almost two weeks before our tool collected it.</p>\n<p>Goldman, the Facebook official, would not specify which services Facebook relies on to tell it whether an ad might be a problem. He also said the company doesn’t make decisions on an ad based on any one indicator.</p>\n<p>Facebook users have been complaining for more than a year about fake political headlines leading to sites that locked their computers, according to a review of Facebook’s online help forums.</p>\n<p>Cath Nelesen, an Arizona retiree, posted on such a help forum in October 2016, asking “how to stop a hack” that she had seen two times in one week. Nelesen, who describes herself as a “staunch Hillary supporter,” told ProPublica she clicked on an “unbelievable” link about the election. She didn’t recall exactly what it said but thought it may have falsely asserted that Hillary Clinton had been arrested.</p>\n<p>She clearly remembered what happened next, though: “Immediately there was a message that I was infected by malware and needed to call an 800 number affiliated with Microsoft,” Nelesen said. Her son-in-law had worked for Microsoft, and had told her of swindlers claiming to be Microsoft tech support. So she realized it might be a hoax, but she didn’t know how to regain control of her computer.</p>\n<p>“Finally I turned off and prayed,” she said. When she turned the computer back on, it worked — possibly due to the prayer, but more likely because the code that locked up the screen only works when the harmful webpage is open.</p>\n<p>She complained to Facebook and received a generic answer about the importance of reporting problems and avoiding spam. “It was completely worthless to me,” Nelesen said. “You’d think if you report something to somebody the problem would stop, but that isn’t the way it goes. I wouldn’t depend on Facebook for any help.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7624645.gif\" height=\"1\">",

Originally, I wanted to be a high school history teacher. After graduating from school and bouncing around doing a bunch of jobs, I ended up getting an internship at a nonprofit magazine called Catalyst, which covers public education in Chicago, because I was interested in writing. I started working for them and, in doing so, caught the journalism bug. I’d always been very interested and passionate about social justice issues.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171128-jason-grotto-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171128-jason-grotto-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171128-jason-grotto-3x2.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171128-jason-grotto-3x2.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Reporter Jason Grotto.\n<span>(Michael Schmidt, special to ProPublica Illinois)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I grew up in Chicago and was a bit of a problem child. I went to public schools and did not do well. My mother was remarried, and I ended up moving to the suburbs and got a lot more attention. I used to ditch a lot of school, and I couldn’t do that in the suburbs because they had systems in place. I personally had an experience where I was able to see firsthand the contrast — and I went to a good public school in Chicago. It always made me realize some of the notions that we have about living in a meritocracy are suspect. It just raised a lot of questions for me. That’s kind of been a driving force behind my journalism.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s been your most rewarding experience as a journalist?</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever you see impact from your work, it’s really rewarding. When I was at the Miami Herald, I did a series of stories on a poverty program that funded a massive redevelopment project in a poor neighborhood. The developer was from Boston. What this developer was going to do was supposedly build a pharmaceutical park there. One of the things that he said he would do was build a clinic. It turns out there was nobody coming. He was just taking the money and living large. After our stories ran, the developer ended up going to prison. Years later, I got a call from the director of the State Department of Health. She thanked me and said, “We want to let you know that we’re building a clinic on that spot, and your story is what drove us to do that.” That’s the kind of thing you live for.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you interested in investigating with ProPublica Illinois?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m very interested in issues of equity, financial issues in particular. For the past five years or so, I’ve been doing a lot of stories on municipal finance. The last couple of years, I’ve focused <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/\">on property taxation</a>. I think taxation, in general, is very important. I’m interested in ferreting out financial issues that impact poor people in a disparate way.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are some of your role models in the field?</strong></p>\n<p>My biggest role model is this pair of journalists who started at the Philadelphia Inquirer, Donald Barlett and James Steele. They wrote a lot about taxation and financial issues. Ever since, I’ve been reading investigations the way you would read a novel. I’ve always looked at those two as models for what I wanted to do. They took very complex issues like income tax and boiled them down and expressed them in a way your average reader can not just understand but also viscerally react to. That’s a huge feat and something I’ve always tried to do with my journalism. I like to think that what we’ve been able to do is write those stories and convey the information in a way that makes people sit up in the chair or spit up their Cheerios.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some underreported stories in Illinois that you wish had more coverage?</strong></p>\n<p>I think some of the forces behind the demographic shifts are among the biggest stories. You’ll see stories headlined, “African-American population is down ‘x’ percent,” but there’s not a lot behind those stories. What I think is important is to try to get behind some of the public policy forces that may be driving some of that. I think that’s one big underreported story here. What we often look at as investigative journalists are ironies. Why something is presented one way but really when you peel back the onion, it’s something else. There’s a lot of that in Chicago, in Cook County and in the state of Illinois.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the biggest lesson journalism has taught you?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest lesson journalism has taught me is that often you have to fight and work hard to get to the truth. That things that appear a certain way on the surface are not always that way. If you’re complacent and just take things at face value, you’re going to miss the truth. Our job is to get as close to that truth as we can and, in doing so, you have to fight and you have to work really hard because there are some people and some institutions that don’t want you to get there.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7623726.gif\" height=\"1\">",

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ken-schwencke\">Ken Schwencke</a> </p>\n<p>In the early hours of June 5, 2015, Gary Bravo was leaving Sammy T’s in downtown Huntsville, Alabama. The club was hosting a gay night because the last of the city’s few gay bars had closed and some downtown bars were picking up the slack.</p>\n<p>As Bravo walked out with two co-workers, they encountered a group of young men. One grabbed Bravo’s friend, and Bravo intervened. The next thing he remembers, someone spun him around, and he was on the ground being punched and kicked while his attackers shouted homophobic slurs. Faggot. Cocksucker.</p>\n<p>“A couple more hits and I would have ended up being brain dead,” he recalled.</p>\n<p>Bravo suffered extensive injuries from the attack. His right eye was bloodied and swollen, and he couldn’t see from it for weeks. His eye socket had to be reconstructed.</p>\n<p>Despite his attackers’ words during the beating, police did not investigate it as a hate crime, or report it to state or federal authorities as one.</p>\n<p>Bravo’s case is just one of thousands lost each year to a deeply flawed system for collecting hate crime data, one that has left the U.S. with unreliable, incomplete official counts and little handle on the true scope of bias-motivated violence.</p>\n<p>Under a federal law passed in 1990, the FBI is required to track and tabulate crimes in which there was “manifest evidence of prejudice” against a host of protected groups, including homosexuals, regardless of differences in how state laws define who’s protected. The FBI, in turn, relies on local law enforcement agencies to collect and submit this data, but can’t compel them to do so.</p>\n<p>The evidence suggests that many police agencies across the country are not working very hard to count hate crimes. Thousands of them opt not to participate in the FBI’s hate crime program at all. Among the 15,000 that do, some 88 percent reported they had no hate crimes. According to federal records, the Huntsville Police Department has never reported a hate crime.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement agencies reported a total of 6,121 hate crimes in 2016 to the FBI, but estimates from the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the federal government, pin the number of potential hate crimes at almost 250,000 a year — one indication of the inadequacy of the FBI’s data.</p>\n<p>“The current statistics are a complete and utter joke,” said Roy Austin, former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division. Austin also worked at the White House on data and civil rights and helped develop an open data plan for police data.</p>\n<p>It’s true that many hate crime cases fall away before they start because about half the victims never report them to authorities.</p>\n<p>But to understand why so many cases that <em>are</em> reported to authorities still fall through the cracks, ProPublica requested incident reports or aggregate data from more than 350 law enforcement agencies in 48 states, including the 50 largest agencies nationwide, on the bias-motivated crimes they had investigated since 2010.</p>\n<p>More than 280 agencies responded, but in many cases only to say they hadn’t investigated any such incidents, or had no records, or that their records were bad. When we followed up with agency public information officers, they acknowledged that investigators frequently did not mark down incidents as motivated by bias, even if there was evidence suggesting this was so — a spray-painted swastika, for example, might be classified simply as vandalism and not also as a hate crime.</p>\n<p>The FBI and some larger agencies champion a two-tiered process in which incidents classified by the first responding officer as potentially bias-motivated are re-evaluated by a second investigator, who determines if the incident should be counted officially as a hate crime. Few of the agencies that responded to our records request appeared to follow this procedure.</p>\n<p>In most states, local law enforcement agencies send their hate crime data to the state, which is then supposed to submit it to the FBI, but we found several instances in which this chain broke down. The Orlando Police Department, for example, told us it had reported five hate crimes for 2015 to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, but the FBI data shows no hate crimes investigated by Orlando that year. Orlando police say FDLE acknowledged the city’s data hadn’t been sent to the FBI “due to a system error,” but an FDLE spokesperson told ProPublica the Orlando police hadn’t submitted the information on time.</p>\n<p>Variations in how states define hate crimes also cause confusion that contributes to the undercount. That appears to be one factor in what happened with the Huntsville case.</p>\n<p>Alabama has a hate-crime statute, but it only applies to acts of bias based arising from “race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or physical or mental disability,” not sexual orientation. A prosecutor on Bravo’s case acknowledged Bravo’s sexual orientation clearly played a role in his attack, but a spokesman for the Huntsville police said the assault couldn’t be reported as a hate crime because gay people aren’t protected under the state’s law.</p>\n<p>The 1990 federal law, however, includes crimes against gay people among those it tracks and asks agencies to report such cases even if no hate crime charge was prosecuted.</p>\n<p>Jack McDevitt, a longtime hate crimes researcher and the director of Northeastern’s Institute on Race and Justice, has reviewed police incident reports to check if investigators missed indicators that assaults or vandalism were actually hate crimes.</p>\n<p>“We’ve found quite a bit of misclassification or missed cases that could have been investigated,” he said. “You’ve got police officers who aren’t trained to ask the right questions.”</p>\n<p>It might not seem like being left out of the official hate crime count would rank high among Bravo’s concerns, but he said it did. Not being counted made him feel as though he and victims like him are being erased — and that there’s no accountability for the bias that motivates their attackers.</p>\n<p>“If it happens to someone else, they’re going to be treated the same exact way, and it’s going to be unfair,” he said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When we asked local law enforcement agencies across the country for their hate-crime reports and data, it quickly became clear that this was an area of substantial uncertainty and discomfort for many of them.</p>\n<p>In Omaha, Nebraska, Deputy City Attorney Bernard J. in den Bosch said he couldn’t release older hate crime records in response to ProPublica’s request because the police department suspected that former employees had classified such crimes incorrectly in reporting them to the FBI.</p>\n<p>“The Omaha Police Department does not feel comfortable providing the numbers since they are concerned about their accuracy,” in den Bosch said, adding that it was difficult to identify hate crimes properly and that the employees entrusted to do so had done a job the department was now “leery of.”</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>Have You Witnessed or Been the Victim of a Hate Incident?</h3>\n<p>ProPublica is collecting accounts of hate crimes from victims and witnesses. <a href=\"http://documentinghate.com/\">Tell us your story.</a></p>\n</aside>\n<p>A spokesman for the Madison, Wisconsin, police department acknowledged its officers weren’t trained in identifying bias-motivated incidents and had not been submitting reports properly as a result.</p>\n<p>For one thing, officers weren’t sure if an incident had to be prosecuted as a hate crime to be counted (it doesn’t). After receiving ProPublica’s information request, department officials said they altered their policies on reporting such crimes to the FBI and reclassified dozens of incidents.</p>\n<p>In several cases, the information agencies sent ProPublica about hate crime investigations since 2010 was at odds with what they had submitted to the federal government.</p>\n<p>According to FBI data, the Anne Arundel County Police in Maryland, which polices half a million people between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., reported no hate crimes between 2012 and 2015. But the department sent us 68 pages of reports for the past 5 years, showing that county police responded to well over 100 incidents, including many in which there was evidence of crimes motivated by bias.</p>\n<p>In one case, a woman brought her new boyfriend, a black man, to the home of her ex-boyfriend. He allegedly swung a hammer at the visitor, saying “I don’t want any niggers in my house, get this nigger out of my house.” According to another report, someone scratched the same word into the side of a black man’s car and stole from it.</p>\n<p>Officials with the Maryland State Police said many of these cases weren’t reported to the FBI because the Anne Arundel County Police — unsure if they were hate crimes — had flagged them as “inconclusive” in paperwork. Lt. Ryan Frashure, a spokesman for the county police, said the agency has started marking more of its reports as conclusive if they have the appearance of a bias motivation. Indeed, in the 2016 FBI hate crime report, the most recent available, the Anne Arundel County Police reported 16 hate crimes.</p>\n<p>Officials at some police departments acknowledged that their officers were simply not in the habit of classifying incidents as possible hate crimes, even when there was evidence that this was the case.</p>\n<p>The Miami-Dade Police Department, Florida’s largest law enforcement agency, reported just two hate crimes to the state since 2010. Records officials told us they could not find any reports from that period in which investigating officers noted that a crime had a bias motivation.</p>\n<p>“I was on the road for 9 years, but when I wrote a report, I don’t ever remember titling it a hate crime,” said Detective Argemis Colome, a spokesman for the department. “If they would have done graffiti on a wall, it would have been titled a vandalism.”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-sammy-t-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171204-sammy-t-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171204-sammy-t-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171204-sammy-t-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-sammy-t-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>On Jan. 5, 2015, Gary Bravo was assaulted while leaving Sammy T’s in downtown Huntsville, Alabama. According to Bravo, his attackers hurled anti-gay epithets while they punched and kicked him.\n<span>(Andrea Morales for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>After speaking with ProPublica, the department’s director ordered an audit to see whether the department had failed to identify hate crimes properly and, thus, to report them to the state and the FBI.</p>\n<p>In general, police departments nationwide have embraced data in the last 20 years, using an ever-more sophisticated array of it to track where crimes are happening, to allocate resources, and to hold commanders accountable for results. The New York Police Department’s CompStat initiative is among the most prominent of such efforts and has been credited with playing a role in broad, lasting reductions in violent crime in what was once considered an ungovernable city.</p>\n<p>Yet, for many law enforcement agencies, collecting and using data on hate crimes has remained a stubborn exception. According to Brian Levin, a former New York City police officer who studies hate crimes, some law enforcement agencies lack a commitment from the top to properly investigate such incidents and collect data on them.</p>\n<p>“You have to have a combination of training, executive leadership, and some kind of infrastructure that is sustained and continuing,” Levin said.</p>\n<p>Myesha Braden, a former civil rights prosecutor in the Department of Justice, said police departments often miss opportunities early on to communicate to officers that hate crimes are a priority. “If an officer knows coming into the police academy that hate crime is one of the important crimes they’ll be investigating, at least the seed is planted,” she said.</p>\n<p>A recent ProPublica review of training academy standards found that only 12 states have laws requiring police to learn how to identify and investigate hate crimes at that stage; few agencies provide such training once officers leave the academy.</p>\n<p>Officers at several police departments told ProPublica they thought it was up to prosecutors to decide if an incident was a hate crime, or that they needed a suspect in custody to categorize an offense as a hate crime in their reports.</p>\n<p>Such misconceptions stop officers from classifying hate crimes as they should, said Michael Lieberman, the Anti-Defamation League’s counsel in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>“To say that there’s not enough to prosecute it, that’s not the question. The question is what happened at the scene of the crime,” he said. It wouldn’t take much to encourage better reporting, he added — for starters, more police departments could add a field to incident report forms allowing officers to mark that a crime had a bias motivation.</p>\n<p>“What’s on the form is what’s important,” Lieberman said. “You have to have a dropdown box that says ‘hate crime.’”</p>\n<p>The Boston Police Department is frequently held up as a model because it has a dedicated civil rights unit that handles hate-crime investigations. Officers in the unit train BPD recruits to identify bias motivations when they fill out crime reports, and the unit serves as secondary investigators on every potential hate crime, Sgt. Det. Carmen Curry, a supervisor in the unit, said in an email. On top of that, officers in the civil rights unit search through police reports daily for terms like “gay,” so that potential hate crimes don’t get missed. </p>\n<p>BPD has reported 996 hate crimes to the FBI since 2010, averaging about 142 a year.\n \n“It’s a very difficult thing to maintain trust in law enforcement right now,” Curry said. “The fact that the BPD goes out front and has a unit to respond to these types of incidents sends an important message.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Momentum to pass a federal law to count hate crimes started to build in the late-1980s, spurred in part by a notorious case in New York.</p>\n<p>In 1986, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, was killed by a car in Howard Beach, Queens, while running in terror from four white men who hurled epithets as they chased him from their neighborhood. Ed Koch, then the mayor of New York, called it a “modern-day lynching.”</p>\n<p>When the House debated a bill in 1989, Democratic Rep. Barbara Kennelly called Griffith’s death an example of why crimes motivated by bias needed to be distinguished from other crimes, tracked and counted separately.</p>\n<p>“These crimes of prejudice must be recorded as such if we are to come up with informed ways to prevent them in the future,” she said. “The basic idea behind hate crime legislation is simple: The more we know about these crimes of hate, the better chance we have to prevent them. Accurate data on when, where and how often these crimes occur will help.”</p>\n<p>Legislation to collect hate crime statistics encountered stiff resistance from the Justice Department, which said requiring police to divine criminals’ intentions would “discredit” the agency’s overall data efforts, and from the White House, which said it would “impose unnecessary burdens” on police. There were also those who opposed including crimes against gay people in the count.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, our society should not enshrine homosexuality on a pedestal alongside race and religion as the primary focus of our civil rights laws,” Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., said before a debate on the bill. “Do not let the sexual revolutionaries hijack the freedom train.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Hate Crime Statistics Act that passed in 1990 directed the attorney general to keep track of crimes motivated not only by race, color, religion or national origin — the groups protected by the federal hate crime statute at the time — but also those based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department assigned the task to the FBI, which asked local law enforcement agencies to submit detailed information — including the bias motivation, offender’s race, type of offense and date of each possible hate crime — as an addendum to the information they submitted to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program on a variety of crimes, from burglary to homicide.</p>\n<p>To help police understand what to do, the FBI organized training sessions and put together two large gray books packed with information on investigating hate crimes. By 1996, the FBI had held 61 regional conferences, training more than 3,600 law enforcement officers from nearly 1,200 agencies. The conferences covered “investigation, identification, reporting and appropriate handling” of hate crimes, according to congressional records from that period.</p>\n<p>The first hate crime data released by the FBI in 1991 had information from 2,771 law enforcement agencies in 32 states. By the next year, that jumped to 6,181 agencies in 41 states and the District of Columbia. By 1999, the number had nearly doubled to 12,122 agencies. In the latest release, 2016, the FBI reported that 15,254 agencies participated. Still, participation just means agencies submitted information of any kind — even if it’s only the form that says they had no hate crimes. The percentage of agencies reporting zero hate crimes has grown from 73 percent in 1991 to 88 percent in 2016.</p>\n<p>Today, the government does little to help local law enforcement to collect accurate and complete hate crime statistics.</p>\n<p>The Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, once sent hate crimes specialists around the country to work with state and local cops, but no longer does so.</p>\n<p>While the FBI still does technical training on how to send data to the UCR program, “the UCR trainers do not provide training regarding the investigation of hate crimes,” according to Stephen Fischer, a spokesperson for the division that used to run hate-crime-specific training. Fischer said the agency is working with local police to modernize their computer systems, which is designed to facilitate all reporting.</p>\n<p>Cynthia Deitle, the chief of the FBI’s Civil Rights Unit from 2008 to 2011, is now program director for the Matthew Shepard Foundation, which has sponsored a handful of hate crime conferences for police similar to those she used to organize at the FBI. In October, she held one at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis that was attended by about 50 people, some in law enforcement, others from community groups like OUTMemphis, a local LGBT group.</p>\n<p>Six officers came from the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, in part because the state noticed the agency’s hate crime statistics were wrong. According to Chief Deputy Floyd Bonner, the sheriff’s office had wrongly classified several incidents as hate crimes, but further review revealed they were not. For example, he said, when two African-American kids got into a fight at school, the reporting officer checked off the box for a hate crime “for some reason.” Those incorrectly categorized crimes amounted to more than half of the hate crimes the agency reported for the year, a problem Bonner attributed to a lack of training.</p>\n<p>“Time and time again reporting issues come up. So it’s about teaching officers what to recognize,” he said. “We all think that hate crime is on the rise because of the news. But it’s still very important because we should know exactly.”</p>\n<p>Dennis and Judy Shepard gave the keynote address at the conference, telling attendees about their son, Matthew, who died in 1998 after being beaten and tortured by two men because he was gay, and how they had worked for a decade to push for legislation that expanded the federal hate crime law to cover crimes motivated by a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The Shepard/Byrd Act passed in 2009.</p>\n<p>After their speech, they spoke with me about their frustration that attacks like the one that took their son’s life continue not to be reported as, or labeled, hate crimes, even since the new law took effect. When communities don’t know the full toll that bigotry exacts, they have no way to defend themselves, they said. They said the 1990 hate crime statistics statute should have made it mandatory for law enforcement agencies to report to the FBI, not voluntary.</p>\n<p>“The one real flaw of the law is not requiring reporting,” Dennis Shepard said. “If they don’t mark it, then they can’t prosecute it.”</p>\n<hr>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-police-station-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171204-police-station-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171204-police-station-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171204-police-station-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171204-police-station-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>The headquarters of the Huntsville Police Department, which has never reported a hate crime to the FBI.\n<span>(Andrea Morales for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Four months after Gary Bravo’s June 2015 assault, the Huntsville Police Department quietly made a single arrest in the case, charging a southern Alabama man with second-degree assault. They said their investigation had led to only one assailant. Since the man was 18 at the time of the attack and had no prior felonies, he cut a plea deal under Alabama’s youthful offender statute, receiving up to three years of probation. His criminal record remains sealed.</p>\n<p>Publicly, the outcome of the case drew almost no attention. The police and prosecutors had not labeled it a hate crime and dispensed with it as they would any routine street fight.</p>\n<p>The incident did prompt Marianne Landers to open Deja Vieux, a new gay bar — and now the oldest operating one in the city — in a cavernous, windowless space just across a highway from the Huntsville Police Department. Landers said she felt compelled to open a place for gay people after she read about Bravo’s beating and filed paperwork to form a company just 24 days after the attack. She said she thought of her nephew, who doesn’t live in Huntsville, but is also gay.</p>\n<p>Still, the bar’s operator, Cecil Gordon, insisted Bravo’s attack couldn’t have been a hate crime. He said local law enforcement agencies were always good to leaders of the gay community and surely would have given Bravo’s case more attention and been tougher on the perpetrators if they knew Bravo was attacked because he was gay.</p>\n<p>“You can’t fall back on the gay card,” Gordon said of Bravo’s story.</p>\n<p>On an October visit to Deja Vieux, the talk turned to the attack on Bravo. Several of the men who had come for drinks said they did not know if Bravo had been the victim of a hate crime or agreed with Gordon that he wasn’t.</p>\n<p>This is what happens when bias crimes aren’t counted and publicly called out as acts of hate, said James Robinson, the CEO of Free2Be, a statewide LGBT advocacy group that does counseling in Huntsville.</p>\n<p>Robinson tried to publicize the attack on Bravo and helped raise funds for his recovery. He understood the assault couldn’t be prosecuted as a hate crime under Alabama law, but nonetheless thought the police should acknowledge that anti-gay bias had motivated the attack. Otherwise, how would anyone know the violence was aimed not only at Bravo, but at the larger community to which he belonged?</p>\n<p>“Words have power in two kinds of ways: They have power when you speak them and power when you don’t,” Robinson said. “The words need to be said. This community needs to be recognized.”</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7612443.gif\" height=\"1\">",

Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty\">we examined a dozen such cases in Baltimore</a>.</p>\n<p>Smith’s troubling ordeal, Alford plea included, is a road map of nearly every way the justice system breaks down — and how easily a cascade of bad outcomes can be triggered by one small miscarriage of justice. For Smith, a young black man in Baltimore, it started with a questionable collar. Nine years later he’s still struggling to clear his name.  </p>\n<h3>The Arrest</h3>\n<p>Smith’s saga began in the summer of 2008 in the low-income, high-crime neighborhood in southwest Baltimore where he lived. A man named Robert Long had been shot twice in the head execution-style that March. Long was a cooperating witness in a police investigation, and the killing had all the makings of a hit.</p>\n<p>A man and a female prostitute both claimed to have seen the murder and fingered Smith. At the time, Smith was 25 and had a record of minor drug and assault offenses. When he was arrested about three months after the murder, Smith was adamant that he had nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p>At this point, the justice system appeared to work as it should. Smith had a bail hearing before a judge who said the prosecution’s evidence was nothing more than “skeletal allegations.” In a rare move for a murder case, Baltimore District Judge Nathan Braverman released Smith on $350,000 bond.</p>\n<p>“It was probably the thinnest case I’d ever seen,” Braverman, now retired, said recently. Smith’s alleged crimes were the most heinous of the cases before him that day, he said, but Smith was the only one granted bail — a sign of how weak the evidence was.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171201-demetrius-smith-portrait-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171201-demetrius-smith-portrait-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171201-demetrius-smith-portrait-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171201-demetrius-smith-portrait-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Smith has tried unsuccessfully to get the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office to clear his name in a criminal case in which even a top prosecutor said there were “some issues about the facts.”\n<span>(Lexey Swall for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>But what should have been the first step in freeing Smith from a misguided murder charge instead further ensnared him. Braverman’s bail decision drew sharp public criticism, and Smith was soon back in the sights of the same detective who investigated the murder.</p>\n<p>About a month later, Detective Charles Bealefeld arrested Smith again, this time for allegedly shooting a man in the leg during a late-night robbery. Bealefeld, the brother of the then-police commissioner, wrote in his report that “word on the street” was that Smith was the assailant.</p>\n<p>Smith lived near the victim and told police he knew the victim’s parents well enough to call them by nicknames. But the victim never named Smith or described his assailant as someone he’d seen before. He said only that a black male in his 20s shot him. Later that night at the hospital, the victim identified Smith from a photo array. Bealefeld then found a second witness, another prostitute, who he said also picked Smith out of an array.</p>\n<p>At this point, Smith was convinced Bealefeld was targeting him. He told his lawyers that the detective had admitted during the arrest that he knew Smith didn’t do it. Bealefeld left the Baltimore police in 2008 amid a federal investigation into a racial incident in the department <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-02-27/news/0902260139_1_police-commissioner-frederick-bealefeld-iii-homicide-detectives\">in which he was named publicly by a city councilman and local media</a>. He declined to comment. Bealefeld is now an officer with the Annapolis Police Department.</p>\n<p>After Smith’s second arrest, the head of the police union told the local press that it proved Braverman had been reckless in releasing Smith. “It’s frustrating to police officers who did the hard work to get this guy charged,” the union head said, calling for the judge to be banned from presiding over bail hearings.</p>\n<h3>The Trial</h3>\n<p>Smith was jailed until his murder trial 18 months later, and unwaveringly maintained his innocence. The cases against him were remarkably similar: The prosecution relied almost exclusively on eyewitness testimony — and in each case a key witness was a prostitute.</p>\n<p>In January 2010, Smith went on trial for Long’s murder. Prosecutor Rich Gibson, a six-year veteran of the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office, hung his case on the testimony of the man who’d first identified Smith as the killer. The witness claimed he’d not only seen the murder from a nearby pay phone, but knew why it was done. Long, he said, had stolen drugs from Smith. Gibson ran with that theory, building Smith’s history of minor offenses into a story of a neighborhood kingpin slaughtering the victim to send a message about what happens to those who steal from him.</p>\n<figure>\n<h3>The Informant</h3>\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"feedlyNoScript\">\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4319868-Informant-letters/annotations/390900.html\">View note</a>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>What Gibson didn’t tell the jury was that the witness was an informant for the police whose assistance on multiple cases had repeatedly kept him out of trouble. The witness only told police he’d seen the murder after he was arrested on an unrelated charge, according to police files. And, court records show, the witness had a clear understanding that any breaks he got for his testimony would best be hidden from the defense. At one point, he even wrote the judge in his case directly to ask for a sentence modification for his participation in Smith’s murder trial, saying “as you already know, the detective nor the state’s attorney can contact me about my matter because that would be promising me something for my testimony.”</p>\n<p>Even more troubling, there was evidence that the witness wasn’t at the scene of the murder at all. Baltimore has cameras panning much of the city 24 hours a day, and the murder was caught on tape. The shooter couldn’t be seen, but what was clear is that no one was at the pay phone at the time of the shooting, said Michele Nethercott, the head of the Innocence Project Clinic at the University of Baltimore Law School. The prostitute who also said she witnessed the murder wasn’t on the video either, Nethercott said. It’s unclear why the video footage wasn’t addressed in detail at Smith’s trial. Gibson declined to comment about his actions in the case.</p>\n<p>The jury found Smith guilty. When he was sentenced to life plus 18 years, Smith told the judge, “They know I didn’t do this.”</p>\n<p>That conviction did more than send Smith to prison. It pushed him into choices he never would have made.</p>\n<h3>The Plea</h3>\n<p>A year after his murder trial in February 2011, Gibson offered Smith a plea deal on the still pending charges for the shooting. Smith, proclaiming his innocence, reluctantly agreed. The system had failed him so badly once, he felt like he was “in a no-win situation,” Smith told the court.</p>\n<p>The deal Smith made is known an as Alford plea. It allows a defendant to say for the record that he’s innocent of the crime but believes the state has enough evidence to convict him. Still, Smith railed against a central piece of Gibson’s evidence — that the victim had identified Smith from a photo array. That didn’t make any sense, Smith told the judge, since the victim “was my neighbor. He didn’t say ‘my neighbor did it.’ He didn’t say, ‘Well that guy across the street did it.’”</p>\n<p>Under the plea, Smith would serve 10 years concurrently with his life sentence. But Smith was worried about what would happen when he was exonerated, which Smith fervently believed would happen eventually. If he was no longer serving a life sentence, he didn’t want to be stuck serving the 10 years for another crime he didn’t commit. So, he wanted his plea deal to have an escape hatch: He must be allowed the chance to get out of the 10-year sentence if he was found innocent of the murder.</p>\n<p>Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams called the deal “strange,” but agreed that under those circumstances Smith could come back to his courtroom to revisit the plea. Gibson also agreed<a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/4316404-Demetrius-Smith-Alford-Transcript-Whitehead.html#document/p47\">, according to a transcript</a>, and that unlike most plea deals he would allow Williams full discretion.</p>\n<p>The agreement was also laid out the next day by Smith’s public defender in a <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/4316474-Demetrius-Smith-Motion-Sentence-Modification.html#document/p18\">court filing</a>. It said that although Williams made no promises about what his ruling would be, the judge would nevertheless be the one to “determine whether to change the sentence” and “the assistant state’s attorney agreed not to oppose the judge’s ruling.”</p>\n<p>“I’m copping out to something I didn’t do,” Smith said at the hearing. “I just want to get it over with.”</p>\n<h3>The Exoneration</h3>\n<p>Astonishingly, mere months later in the spring of 2011, Smith’s stubborn faith seemed validated.</p>\n<p>During a related investigation, the U.S. attorney’s office in Maryland had turned up Long’s real killer and informed Baltimore prosecutors that they had the wrong man. Federal agents quickly unraveled the case against Smith. It wasn’t about drugs, as Gibson had argued. Instead, the victim, Long, had been killed in a murder-for-hire plot to keep him from testifying about crimes committed by his boss. Long had also specifically warned the Baltimore authorities not to include his lawyer in a meeting about cooperating because the lawyer worked for his boss. But they did it anyway. Six days after police searched his boss’ home based on Long’s information, Long was dead.</p>\n<p>At Smith’s murder trial, however, Detective Steve Hohman had testified that there was no reason to investigate Long’s boss. He left out that police had done several interviews with Long’s associates that pointed to the boss as a suspect, Long’s family had told them that the boss threatened to kill Long days before his death, and the police had requested the boss’ phone records<span></span>. But that information wasn’t turned over to Smith’s defense, a violation of Smith’s constitutional rights. Gibson told the jury that “no stone was left unturned.”</p>\n<p>Federal agents also discovered that the prostitute who’d identified Smith had been six miles away receiving methadone treatment around the time of the murder. She recanted her statement, telling federal investigators that Hohman had yelled, banged the table and generally pressured her into her testimony. (By this time, the state’s other key witness, who supposedly saw Smith from a pay phone, was dead.)</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171201-demetrius-and-nethercott-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171201-demetrius-and-nethercott-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171201-demetrius-and-nethercott-inline.jpg 1600w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171201-demetrius-and-nethercott-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Michele Nethercott, head of the Innocence Project Clinic in Baltimore, helped Smith fight to be cleared of a murder he didn’t commit and then to be released from a prison sentence for another crime he said he didn’t do.\n<span>(Lexey Swall for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Hohman has since been promoted, and the Baltimore Police Department said it stands by its investigation.</p>\n<p>Gibson and the state’s attorney’s office continued to insist to Smith’s lawyers that Smith had been justly prosecuted, according to Smith’s public defender and Nethercott, the innocence lawyer who later took up Smith’s case.</p>\n<p>A year and a half went by while Smith remained locked up, serving a life sentence for a murder someone else had committed. Under pressure from federal prosecutors, the state finally and quietly dropped the case against Smith in August 2012.</p>\n<p>“What was driving this case really was the U.S. attorney,” Nethercott said recently. The federal government was about to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/jose-morales-sentenced-life-prison-murdering-witness-baltimore-city-case\">indict and prosecute another person</a> “while Demetrius was sitting there serving life on a theory that was completely different.”</p>\n<p>Rod Rosenstein, the top federal prosecutor in Maryland at the time and now the deputy attorney general of the United States, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/attorney-general-recognizes-two-maryland-assistant-us-attorneys\">announced</a> that the federal case had “resulted in the exoneration of an innocent man and the conviction of the real killer.”</p>\n<p>No such declaration came from Baltimore prosecutors.</p>\n<p>“What they were not willing to do,” Nethercott said, “was to say: ‘We clearly made a mistake.’”</p>\n<p>Their error didn’t just damage Smith. Braverman, the judge who’d scoffed at the prosecution’s case, had been shortlisted to move up to the circuit court at the time of the bail hearing, according to The Baltimore Sun, but he wasn’t selected. After Smith’s case, the local press closely covered Braverman’s subsequent bail decisions. There was no follow-up acknowledgement from the police or others that his instincts had been right about Smith.</p>\n<p>And even though Smith was cleared of Long’s murder, he was still in maximum security prison in Hagerstown, Maryland, serving his 10-year sentence for the robbery shooting.</p>\n<h3>The Half Measure</h3>\n<p>In May 2013, as promised, Smith went back before the judge to revisit the terms of that deal. By this time, he’d been in prison for nearly five years.</p>\n<p>The case was now being handled by Tony Gioia, then head of the state’s attorney’s conviction integrity unit. Gioia made no mention of Smith’s innocence on the murder charge, telling the judge that the prosecution had “moved to vacate the murder conviction for a Brady violation” by the original prosecutor, Gibson. Brady refers to the 1963 Supreme Court ruling that said prosecutors must turn over evidence of innocence to the defense for a trial to be fair.</p>\n<p>Gioia said he’d reviewed the police documents about the shooting, and had “some issues about the facts.” He agreed to modify Smith’s sentence to time served and release him immediately on three years’ probation. Smith was free.</p>\n<p>But on paper he was still a convicted felon for the shooting, limiting his ability to get a lease and a job — he had three offers revoked after a background check. Smith wanted a clean record and to be completely free of the system that had now eaten up nearly a decade of his life.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171201-demetrius-work-inline.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171201-demetrius-work-inline.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171201-demetrius-work-inline.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20171201-demetrius-work-inline.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171201-demetrius-work-inline.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Smith works with Natural Concerns Landscape Contractors in Maryland. Smith had three job offers revoked because his record still lists a felony for a crime he says he didn’t commit. <span>(Lexey Swall for ProPublica)</span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In the four years since his release, damning new evidence had emerged that echoed the murder case. The prostitute recanted her statement implicating Smith and said she’d been coerced into identifying Smith by Bealefeld, the detective who investigated both of Smith’s cases.</p>\n<p>The night of the shooting, the prostitute had told police she heard gunshots and saw a man she’d been with earlier flee the scene. Bealefeld, she said, showed her an array of photos and repeatedly pointed to a picture of Smith, saying “That’s him, isn’t it?” When she continually denied that Smith was the man she saw, Bealefeld threatened to arrest her.</p>\n<p>“I was afraid I’d be locked up, and so I finally signed the array as he had directed me,” she said in an affidavit in June 2013.</p>\n<p>But the new evidence had come too late. Maryland gives defendants a special path to challenge their conviction with new evidence of innocence, but those who take plea deals are barred. Smith’s Alford plea meant he couldn’t get the conviction vacated.</p>\n<p>He had one last option: Ask Judge Williams to modify his plea deal again.</p>\n<h3>The Final Attempt</h3>\n<p>With the help of new pro bono lawyers, Smith filed a motion to change his sentence for the shooting from “time-served” to “probation before judgement,” which means a judge withholds finding a defendant guilty so long as the defendant successfully completes a period of probation. Since Smith had finished his three years of probation, the change would essentially wipe the conviction off his record.</p>\n<p>On July 28, Smith walked back into Williams’ courtroom in a light blue blazer with hope that the judge would finally end his ordeal.</p>\n<p>When Smith’s case was called, a familiar face stood up for the prosecution. Gibson, the original prosecutor, was back and he told the judge he opposed any changes.</p>\n<p>“What’s your basis for saying ‘no’?” Williams asked him. “You acknowledge” that on the murder charge “he was exonerated; is that correct?”</p>\n<p>“The State acknowledges,” Gibson responded, “that — that after the case was tried, and the defendant was convicted of murder, and after the — the Court of Appeals affirmed that conviction, my office, after discussions with federal authorities, chose to vacate that conviction to allow the federal prosecution to go forward the way they envisioned it.”</p>\n<p>Williams looked taken aback. “So, you’re stating in open court that your office isn’t saying that he wasn’t guilty. You just did it for other reasons?”</p>\n<p>Gibson offered only a vague reply, and Williams kept pressing him, at one point interjecting with exasperation that “it’s a simple question.”</p>\n<p>In all, Gibson <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4316403-Demetrius-Smith-7-28-17.html#document/p9\">evaded the question five times</a> before Williams abruptly stopped and ruled that Smith’s original guilty plea was a binding plea — meaning that the only way it could be changed was with the support of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p>That contradicted how both the judge and the prosecutor had defined the plea six and a half years earlier. At the time in 2011, Gibson said that the terms of the deal meant Smith could “come back and put it before the judge and the judge can do whatever he’s going to do with it.”</p>\n<p>And Williams <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4316404-Demetrius-Smith-Alford-Transcript-Whitehead.html#document/p48\">had specifically noted</a> the plea meant that the prosecution was “giving up the right to say to this court, ‘Judge, you cannot change it.’ He now has acknowledged that. ... It will be up to me to make a decision.”</p>\n<p>But now, for reasons he didn’t explain, Williams said, “I have not the authority ... despite what I would, what I may or may not want to do it’s irrelevant.”</p>\n<p>“Motion is denied.”</p>\n<p>Smith’s lawyer, Adam Braskich, jumped up to argue that was incorrect, but the judge cut him off with a curt “thank you.”</p>\n<p>In the hallway outside the court, Smith shook his head, not entirely surprised. His gold teeth flashed through a smile. “It is what it is,” he said. “You keep fighting.”</p>\n<p>Braskich and Smith’s other lawyer, Barry Pollack, thought it was clear the judge had the legal authority to change Smith’s sentence.</p>\n<p>“After being wrongfully convicted of murder and then convicted for an assault he didn’t commit, Demetrius served five years in prison,” Pollack said. “He should not also be saddled with a felony conviction. We didn’t think a fresh start was too much to ask, and we’re disappointed that Demetrius still can’t put this behind him.”</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Enjoyed the company of a legend in the Democratic Party, Carole Fischer, as we came together to support Opel Jones running for County Council District 2. <a href=\"https://t.co/uugeQ2r1qZ\">pic.twitter.com/uugeQ2r1qZ</a></p>— Rich Gibson (@RichGibson4hoco) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichGibson4hoco/status/932105282284597249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2017</a></blockquote>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Williams declined to comment on his ruling.</p>\n<p>The next possible step is to apply for a rare pardon from the governor.</p>\n<p>Like Gibson — who’s running for state’s attorney one jurisdiction over in Howard County, Maryland — the current Baltimore City state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, won’t say whether her office believes Smith is innocent of the murder, or the shooting.

        "content": "<p>\nby <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/allan-sloan\">Allan Sloan</a> </p>\n<p>Donald Trump isn’t exactly shy when it comes to denouncing things he doesn’t like. And there’s one particular part of the tax code that he denounced over and over both during the campaign and after taking office.</p>\n<p>He said that the people benefiting from this portion of the code were “getting away with murder.”</p>\n<p>So you’d think that the tax bill being pushed through Congress with Trump’s eager backing would be closing this loophole. But you’d be wrong. As you’ll see in a bit, talking about closing the loophole isn’t the same as closing it.</p>\n<p>The loophole is called “carried interest.” That’s tax jargon for the share of investors’ profits that goes to the managers of private equity funds, venture capital funds and hedge funds. The standard rate is 20 percent of a fund’s profits, although there’s wide variation, both up and down.</p>\n<aside>\n<h3>About This Column</h3>\n<p>Allan Sloan is an editor-at-large at ProPublica and a seven-time winner of the Loeb Award, business journalism's highest honor. This column was written for The Washington Post.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The loophole is that the managers’ piece of the action comes from owning a piece of the partnership called a “profits interest” rather than getting a fee from the partnership.</p>\n<p>When an investment has been held for more than a year before being sold, the managers’ “profits interest” proceeds, like the gains that go to the “capital investors” who put up the money, is taxed as long-term capital gains rather than as ordinary income. Cap gains currently carry a top federal income tax rate of 23.8 percent, whereas “earned income” such as fees and salaries carries a max tax of 40.5 percent (or 43.4 percent, if you include the Medicare tax).</p>\n<p>(The other part of the managers’ fee — typically two percent a year of the investments under management — is treated as regular income.)</p>\n<p>People, even including many Wall Street types whom I know, have been offended by the carried interest loophole for years.</p>\n<p>After all, if you run a mutual fund and get a bonus based on your investment performance, that bonus is treated as earned income, not capital gains. So why should things be different for managers of a private equity or venture capital or hedge fund?</p>\n<p>(I’m putting hedge funds last because although they’re the most popular target, they typically don’t hold individual investments long enough to qualify for capital gains treatment.)</p>\n<p>In November, after being criticized because their tax legislation didn’t deal with carried interest, House and Senate Republicans addressed the problem. Sort of, but not really.</p>\n<p>Their “reform” doesn’t require proceeds from “profits interests” to be treated as ordinary income — which would be real reform. Rather, the legislation requires that investments be held for more than three years to get capital gains treatment, rather than the current period of more than one year.</p>\n<p>That’s pretty much a joke, given that venture capital and buyout funds — whose managers are the biggest beneficiaries of the “carried interest” loophole — typically hold investments for well over three years before selling them. This legislation has the appearance of reform, but not the substance.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told The New York Times that the three-year holding period “strikes the right balance for economic growth and fairness without stifling investment in American entrepreneurship.” But this doesn’t address the substance of the loophole, which is that carried interest payments are actually fees masquerading as capital gains, which means they are taxed at a much lower rate than fees.</p>\n<p>Let me take you through this a bit.</p>\n<p>Treating the people who run partnerships differently from the people who are passive investors in partnerships has been around forever. But when private equity, venture capital and hedge funds began pulling in hundreds of billions of dollars of capital and paying their managers billions a year of carried interest, what had been a relatively obscure tax provision turned into a big deal.</p>\n<p>Lots of private equity types claim that special tax treatment for carried interest is vital to them. However, when you look at history, you can see that claim is dubious at best.</p>\n<p>Blackstone and Carlyle, two of the biggest private equity firms (which now call themselves alternative investment firms), were founded in 1985 and 1987, respectively.</p>\n<p>From 1988 through 1990, regular income and capital gains were taxed at the same maximum rate: 28 percent. And in 1991 and 1992, the year another big firm, TPG, was formed, top rates were almost the same: 31 percent for regular income, about 29 percent for cap gains. So unless they were betting on the rates to change — which is, shall we say, highly unlikely — the preferential rate for carried interest was no big deal.</p>\n<p>The rates didn’t really separate much until 1993. That year, the top regular income rate was more than 10 percentage points above the cap gains rate (39.6 percent to 29.2 percent), and the spread kept widening. (You can find the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4317909-Tax-Rates.html\">year by year rates here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Now what about Trump? Was he fouling his own nest by criticizing carried interest? I think not.</p>\n<p>As best as I can tell from Trump’s financial filings and his leaked 2005 federal income tax return, he doesn’t play the carried interest game. So even if carried interest were to be reformed properly, it wouldn’t cost him anything.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: If the pending tax legislation becomes law, heaven forbid, and the carried interest loophole requires a three-year rather than a one-year waiting period, you can bet that Trump and the Republicans will boast about how they taught Wall Street a lesson. And it will be a pack of lies.</p>\n<img width=\"1\" src=\"http://feedpress.me/9499/7581430.gif\" height=\"1\">",
