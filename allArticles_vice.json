        "content": "<p> One of my favorite shows growing up was the early 90s sketch comedy series <i> The State</i>. It was like a proto–weird Twitter, and the actors that comprised the troupe went on to create a lot of my other favorite shows and films, including <i> Wet Hot American Summer</i>, <i> Stella</i>, and <i> Reno 911</i>. A standout of the pack, for me at least, was Michael Ian Black—a boyish and bubbly oddball who appeared in all these things, as well as being a regular guest on <i> I Love the 90s</i>. (He also contributed to VICE back in 2012.)</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdh3-o_-JXc\" data-iframely-id=\"0XVQrjd\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/0XVQrjd?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p> Unfortunately for me, this particular hero of mine happens to have a Twitter account, and uses it—a lot. Although he has always been known for his vaguely liberal opinions online, on this occasion Mike used the passage of the insanely ghoulish GOP tax bill to uh, defend conservative commentator Meghan McCain? Given her politics and the fact that her family (she’s the daughter of Arizona Senator John McCain and businesswoman Cindy McCain) likely stood to gain millions from this tax bill it was unsurprising that she was full-throatedly supporting it, and attacking those who dared defy her on this. But what was surprising (even though I guess it shouldn’t be), was a member of the so-called #resistance refusing to call out a Republican friend.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/evbpkn/twitter-suspended-me-for-trolling-white-supremacists?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=ne4qqx&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p> Michael Ian Black and Meghan McCain actually co-authored a book about getting along despite having different politics or some dumb bullshit back in 2012. When I poked fun at this, mostly out of annoyance with one of my comedic idols, Ian Black snapped: He accused me of being a coward for using a cartoon avatar, of being too judgemental, and eventually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelianblack/status/937389993735094275\" target=\"_blank\">capped it all</a> by (bafflingly) trying to use to the ongoing genocide of Rohingya Muslims as uh, an attempt to dunk on purity politics? I honestly couldn’t figure that one out. </p> <p> The whole interaction, which admittedly saw many of my followers piling onto Mike (who has millions more followers and is much more rich and powerful than I am), saw Mike having a bit of a meltdown. It was genuinely a large bummer for me, but it also caused some of my friends and followers to share some stories of interacting with their own heroes online, almost all of which went uh, poorly. </p><p>The most amazing of which was now-defunct user @nasboat and his years-long feud with Blues Traveller frontman John Popper. Everything started when in 2014, Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/the-guy-from-blues-traveler-is-having-a-twitter-meltdown-and?utm_term=.jfqM1GB2N#.tyGWGEMan\" target=\"_blank\">published a story</a> that brought up an old <i> Behind the Music </i>nugget about how at one point Popper was supposedly to fat to masturbate. </p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/bomani-jones-and-flaming-people-on-twitter/599f34e70ea82ff37ebbb494\" data-iframely-id=\"eKDut0V\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/eKDut0V\"></iframe></div></div><hr><p> Popper responded by hurling invectives at the Buzzfeed writer from the official Blues Traveler account, which unsurprisingly brought on a storm of people making fun of this rich famous person and their hilariously thin-ass skin, including the guy behind the account @nasboat.</p> <p>Here's where things get more complicated: In 2015, one of his friends created a Twitter bot, @assbott, a little piece of code that sent tweets complied of phrases it pulled from @nasboat’s tweets. This account apparently tweeted a gibberish version of the “John Popper can’t honk off” rumor, and Popper came across it (presumably while obsessively searching his own name online). At this moment, something in his brain broke, and the lead singer of Blues Traveller spent the next <i> two years </i>obsessively seething against @nasboat eventually getting to the point where he posted @nasboat’s address, name, employer, and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-popper-from-blues-traveler-will-not-stop-posting-aerial-pictures-of-my-house\" target=\"_blank\">aerial photos of his house</a>. </p> <p> While this is definitely an uh, intense example of this trend online, it's far from an anomaly. In 2011, James Franco (like Ian Black, another onetime VICE contributor) <a href=\"https://www.ivygateblog.com/2011/03/alert-james-franco-says-fuck-the-yale-daily-news/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to a poor review of his Oscar hosting duty with a picture that said “FUCK THE YALE DAILY NEWS”, setting off a mini-online storm. That same year, then Arizona Cardinals quarterback Derek Anderson got an <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/5808580/derek-anderson-got-defensive-was-possibly-wrong-about-defensive-schemes-at-2-am-last-night\" target=\"_blank\">insomniac late-night fight</a> with a fan over pass coverages. More recently, last year the (white) reality star Kendra Wilkinson <a href=\"https://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2017/11/23/kendra-wilkinson.html\" target=\"_blank\">photographed herself picking cotton</a> on a road trip, and when people (correctly) called her out on this she melted down, yelling that her father-in-law is black or some shit. This stuff happens pretty much every day now—as you read this, a moderately famous person is getting into a pointless spat that’s insulting for everyone involved.</p> <p> Before the internet, we could reasonably believe all of our heroes—or our beloved celebs, same difference really—to be dignified and generally better people, capable of staying above the fray. Their politics didn’t matter; and nobody was demanding to know what the lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls thought about immigration reform. If they were a big enough celebrity, they could hire a team of PR people and handlers who would prevent the world from knowing about their suckier qualities—think about how many people made a living in the 90s simply by keeping world from knowing <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/07/the-50-craziest-sex-scandals-in-sports-history/michael-jordan-karla-knafel\" target=\"_blank\">how</a> <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/en_ca/article/43y5x9/that-time-michael-jordan-allegedly-ran-up-a-million-dollar-golf-debt\" target=\"_blank\">shitty</a> a person Michael Jordan was. </p> <p> But that’s over now. We are free to interact with our idols, who are all too often brought down by the weight of their own shitass opinions and rants. The thing is, I still love Michael Ian Black’s work. I will never stop loving <i> The State</i> or <i> Wet Hot American Summer</i>. They both rule and nobody can convince me otherwise. I’m sure Michael Ian Black is a cool guy to hang out with. Hell, I still like that one Blues Traveller song from 1995 that slaps. But I’m not quite sure yet how to square these things with the fact that Twitter has given us an endless feed of reasons to stop liking these people all together. </p><p><i> K.T.

(Because M has not disclosed their transgender status at work, they requested anonymity for this story.) The staff there was very caring, they said, but the clinic was underfunded and understaffed, with a long waiting list for follow-up appointments. &quot;It was almost like musical chairs,&quot; said M, &quot;with more people than seats.&quot; When M began taking hormone therapy for gender transition, delays in care led to month-long lapses in hormone prescriptions, resulting in an emotional and physical roller coaster. </p><p>All of that changed when M reached out to <a href=\"https://www.queermed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">QueerMed</a>, a telehealth practice that provides trans-focused medical care online, via videoconference and other tools, in five states across the Southeast. Within a week, M. had an intake visit, a review of recent blood tests, and a prescription waiting at their local CVS. &quot;I don't feel I have to jump through any hoops—it's all through an app on my smartphone,” said M. “I can access labs, forward labs, send secure texts to the doctor's practice.&quot; The result is care that M said feels both less intrusive and more personalized. &quot;It's really good.&quot;</p><p>The demand for affirming, competent transgender care <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/04/trans-medicine/523731/\" target=\"_blank\">far outsrips</a> what’s available, and in rural areas, physicians able to provide that care are often <a href=\"http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/university-of-iowa-clinic-sees-demand-for-transgender-care-20150724\" target=\"_blank\">few</a> and <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/01/29/how_planned_parenthood_helps_transgender_patients_get_hormone_therapy.html\" target=\"_blank\">far between</a>. By bringing doctors as close to patients as their nearest high-speed internet connection, telehealth offers a potential solution to that gap. </p><p>On the whole, transgender people travel further and receive less insurance coverage for their healthcare than do other sexual minorities. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701471/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> of rural sexual minorities found that 14 percent of transgender and non-binary people lived more than an hour's drive from their primary care providers, compared to only 5 percent of their gay, cisgender counterparts. And respondents to the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports\" target=\"_blank\">US Transgender Survey</a> said they were more likely to travel long distances for transition-related care than for routine care. </p><p>Other studies have show that transgender people were much more likely than cisgender people to have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29226450\" target=\"_blank\">no health insurance</a>, and about a quarter of those responding to a question about barriers to care <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5012371/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> the cost of gender-confirmation therapy (including hormonal and/or surgical therapy) was the main problem in not receiving it.</p><p>Once they make it into a provider's office, transgender patients are likely to have a negative experience related to their transgender status. According to the US Transgender Survey, one third of respondents who had seen a healthcare provider in the past year reported having a negative experience with a provider related to being transgender, and almost a quarter said they'd avoided seeking needed health care due to fear of being mistreated on the basis of their gender identity. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/0715/p142.html\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Family Physicians</a> and <a href=\"http://www.acha.org/ACHA/Programs_and_Services/CE_Activities/Primary_Care_for_Transgender_Patients.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">other</a> <a href=\"https://acpinternist.org/archives/2017/11/adapting-primary-care-to-include-transgender-patients.htm\" target=\"_blank\">associations</a> of primary care physicians are increasingly encouraging their members to provide transition-related care to patients with gender dysphoria. But many unspecialized physicians hesitate, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28344694\" target=\"_blank\">citing fear</a> of making mistakes and lack of knowledge, and in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22559234%20\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledging bias</a>.</p><p>As a result of all of these factors, transgender people living in rural and exurban areas are often faced with a vacuum of physicians willing to perform the bread-and-butter work of transition-related care: prescribing and adjusting hormone replacement therapy and related medication, ordering and reviewing laboratory results, responding to concerns about medication side effects, and monitoring patients' overall health within the context of transition. And while medical educators are <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz9zvb/the-next-generation-of-doctors-will-be-better-at-treating-trans-patients\" target=\"_blank\">beginning</a> to catch up with the demand for trans-competent doctors, there’s still a long way to go.</p><hr><p><i><a href=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/broadly-the-battle-over-transgender-soldiers-in-the-us-military/5a1c5f3b177dd405132356bd\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Broadly profile Rachel Waverly, a former US Army solider who believes her discharge was based on issues surrounding her gender identity:</a></i></p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/broadly-the-battle-over-transgender-soldiers-in-the-us-military/5a1c5f3b177dd405132356bd\" data-iframely-id=\"5ePSTr0\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/5ePSTr0\"></iframe></div></div><hr><p>Before opening QueerMed in mid-2017, Dr. Izzy Lowell ran a brick-and-mortar clinic specializing in transgender medicine for two years. When she made the change to telehealth, reaching rural patients became one of her main goals. “That's the population that I think has the least access,&quot; she said.</p><p>At the heart of video telehealth is a live, two-way interaction between a patient and a provider, using technology similar to a Skype call. Because there's no physical contact with the provider, there's no physical exam—though if the provider thinks an exam is necessary, the patient can be referred to a local provider or an emergency room—and visits to laboratories for blood tests and to pharmacies for prescription medications take place locally. </p><p>The technology essentially removes the geographic barrier to specialty health care for marginalized populations, said Yadin David, a biomedical engineering consultant and founder of the <a href=\"http://ctel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Telemedicine and e-Health Law</a>. &quot;[For people] who think, 'I'd never be able to make it to the medical center, it's too far, it's too expensive, I don't have a car, I cannot leave the home,'&quot; he said, telehealth offers an opportunity to get better, more appropriate and faster care.</p><p>The scope of medical care provided via telehealth can be focused or broad: while Lowell exclusively provides care related to medical transition, Dr. Katie Bast provides gender-affirming primary care as one of several physicians contracted with telehealth practice <a href=\"https://www.steadymd.com/lgbtq\" target=\"_blank\">SteadyMD</a>. </p><p>Bast opened <a href=\"http://mosaichha.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mosaic</a>, an LGBTQ-inclusive brick-and-mortar clinic in Indiana, in mid-2016. She sees about 400 transgender patients in person, and began recruiting patients for her online transgender-focused practice in mid-2017. Through SteadyMD's concierge model, Bast functions as her telehealth patients' primary care physician for a monthly fee of $79. The fee covers routine &quot;visits&quot; with her, inclusive of transition-related care, and easy access to her at other times via secure text messaging. The fee does not cover laboratory tests or medications, and the practice does not accept insurance.</p><p>Guy Friedman, co-founder and CEO of SteadyMD, said there's been high demand for the service from all regions of the US and several other countries. However, Bast can only provide care to people who live in states where she has a medical license—and because licensure can take months, she is currently only able to provide telehealth services to patients in Indiana and California.</p><p>Lowell's model is different in that she exclusively provides services related to gender transition, and she recommends that her patients maintain a separate relationship with a primary care provider to meet their other medical needs. Her practice accepts several forms of insurance, and she is currently licensed in five states in the southeastern US. She said that, for patients paying out of pocket, her services generally cost approximately $800 to 900 per year for the first year of care, and $300 to 500 per year for following years.</p><p>For patients like Allyson Douglas, who lives in Columbia, South Carolina, telehealth has offered a better quality of care than that available locally. Prior to joining Lowell's practice in late November 2017, she was seeing a general practitioner who, while welcoming and competent at prescribing hormones, was not a specialist in transgender care. &quot;There's so much ambiguity as far as trans health is concerned,” Douglas said. “Discovering [I had access to somebody for whom] this was their mission, their specialty, was pretty exciting.”</p><p>Some of Lowell’s patients have told her that if it weren’t for her practice, they wouldn't receive transition-related care at all. Others would have to pay more for less consistent service; M said they paid much more out-of-pocket for services at Planned Parenthood than they did to see Lowell. And still others would have to drive upwards of four hours round-trip to their closest alternative.</p> <p>Although few of Lowell's patients see downsides to receiving care online rather than in person, Yadin David notes that telehealth services may not always be as cost-effective for physicians to provide—and the costs they incur may ultimately be passed on to patients. Furthermore, he said, even when broadband home internet connections are available, they are widely variable in quality, and may not reliably transmit the information needed to make certain diagnoses. And across all kinds of medical care, telehealth has some <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15829049\" target=\"_blank\">drawbacks</a> compared to in-person visits.</p><p>And while seeing a transgender medical specialist online may guarantee an affirming interaction with a physician, patients are not guaranteed that interactions with ancillary health care providers at their local facilities—laboratory and pharmacy staff, for example—will be as positive.</p><p>To Bast, that less represents a challenge than it does an educational opportunity: &quot;Prior to my patient's arrival at their spot,&quot; she said, &quot;I can call ahead, and doctor to pharmacist, doctor to lab tech, doctor to phlebotomist, say, 'I'd like to introduce you to my patient coming in.

        "content": "<p>Last week, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders01042018/\" target=\"_blank\">appeared remotely</a> on two giant monitors before the White House press corps to personally thank corporate America. “The <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3xz7m/the-tax-bill-is-a-fucking-disaster\" target=\"_blank\">historic tax cut</a> I signed into law… is already delivering major economic gains,” the president boasted, ticking off a series of announcements from big business about one-time bonuses, 401(k) contributions, workforce and infrastructure investments, and even higher wages. “I want to thank all of the companies that worked so hard to do it.”</p> <p> Could it be that all the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev5d9w/the-craziest-part-of-the-tax-plan-is-how-we-got-here\" target=\"_blank\">naysayers</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kqpyy/five-reasons-to-hate-the-republican-tax-plan\" target=\"_blank\">economists and advocates and experts who expected</a> Trump’s massive corporate tax cut to quickly get funneled into the pockets of the rich, were wrong? Will the tax cut really spur the kind of economic activity that will boost jobs and wages and lift up the ordinary worker? </p> <p> No. But this may end up being the most aggressive corporate public relations scheme we’ve seen in America since a bunch of movie studios got together during the Great Depression to <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/dispatches-from-incredibl_b_775113.html\" target=\"_blank\">run attack ads</a> smearing Upton Sinclair’s progressive campaign for governor of California. The money flowing to workers in these announcements are like a nickel in a tin can compared to the bounty rushing into corporate treasuries. In many cases, they seem to have been pre-planned prior to the tax bill, done to reap a tax write-off, or announced to mask layoffs elsewhere in the business.</p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/trumps-tax-bill/5a3c3cfe177dd43853645b91\" data-iframely-id=\"URgm85l\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/URgm85l\"></iframe></div></div> <hr><p> Consider the one-time, $1,000 bonuses for employees that many companies, like <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/365908-comcast-announces-1000-bonuses-in-response-to-tax-reform\" target=\"_blank\">Comcast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2018/01/02/t-touting-bonuses-and-investment-fueled/992690001/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T</a>, have announced. First of all, one-time bonuses, while nice to have, are not wage increases. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/10/20/16506256/cea-report-corporate-taxes-wages-boost-job-growth\" target=\"_blank\">promise</a> of the tax cut was not that it would let companies throw a few bucks in the employee tip jar, but permanently raise pay. Bonuses don’t make up for stagnant wages, as Southwest Airlines’ mechanics union, which has been locked in a contract battle for over five years, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/southwest-union-pay-freeze-81909f81462e/\" target=\"_blank\">told the company</a>.</p> <p> The Comcast and AT&amp;T bonuses were also announced late last year, allowing them to be written off as a business expense in 2017. If a business gave a bonus in 2017, it went against the 35 percent corporate tax rate then in effect. If were to give one this year, the bonus would only go against the new 21 percent rate. In other words, it was cheaper for businesses to announce bonuses in December than January, suggesting we may not see much of their kind again.</p> <p> But Comcast and AT&amp;T in particular serve as the poster children for dishonesty in this matter. Because around the same time that they made a big show of rewarding employees with bonuses, both companies quietly <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/companies-gop-tax-bonuses-layoffs-fdf07fdf90d2/\" target=\"_blank\">engaged in layoffs</a>. Comcast fired <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/comcast/comcast-fires-sales-employees-florida-chicago-att-verizon-cable-20180104.html\" target=\"_blank\">500 members of its sales department</a> before Christmas, and AT&amp;T is <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2018/01/02/t-touting-bonuses-and-investment-fueled/992690001/\" target=\"_blank\">eliminating</a> “thousands” of jobs, according to its union, the Communications Workers of America. “We believe there's more than 4,000 people AT&amp;T has (notified of layoffs) across the country,” Larry Robbins, vice president of CWA Local 4900, told the <i>Indianapolis Daily Star</i>. </p> <p> Just to do the math on this, $1,000 bonuses to 200,000 AT&amp;T workers is $200 million. Cancelling 4,000 jobs at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/business/economy/income-rebound-recession.html\" target=\"_blank\">median US compensation of $59,000</a> per year (some of the workers affected likely earned less) would actually amount to a higher number, and unlike the bonuses, those layoffs are permanent. More to the point, <i> any</i> $1,000 bonus for workers is a drop in the ocean compared to chopping the corporate tax rate by 40 percent, as the Trump tax cuts will. AT&amp;T, according to <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tax-cut-bonuses-corporate-pr-gop_us_5a3c1f2ae4b06d1621b3037a\" target=\"_blank\">calculations from economist Dean Baker</a>, will see $2.4 billion in annual savings from that tax cut, more than ten times the likely cost of its the one-time bonus. (Neither Comcast nor AT&amp;T immediately responded to a request for comment.)</p> <p> Then there are the vows to increase investment ringing down from the highest corridors of American business. Boeing, for example, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-applauds-tax-bill-with-300-million-workforce-related-and-charitable-investment-plan-2017-12-20\" target=\"_blank\">announced $200 million in workforce-related investments</a> last month; they also announced $100 million in charitable investments, which are tax-deductible. Southwest has also <a href=\"https://airwaysmag.com/airlines/southwest-airlines-employee-bonus-charitable-contribution-and-further-investment-in-its-boeing-fleet/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a “charitable investment,” also known as a tax deduction. Companies <a href=\"https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">donate to charity</a> all the time to pump up their public image and take tax benefits. And these particular donations don’t even come close to the size of the corporate tax cut. </p> <p> If there are real and enduring upticks in corporate investment from the tax bill, it will emerge in forthcoming data, but recent history suggests we should be deeply skeptical. A 2004 tax holiday allowed businesses to bring $312 billion back from overseas at a 5.25 percent rate. But the top 15 companies that took advantage of the holiday <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203633104576623771022129888\" target=\"_blank\">cut 20,931 jobs</a>, according to a Senate investigation. The money went not into investment, but executive compensation and shareholder payouts, such that even George W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/201509/james-ledbetter/inc-interview-bill-clinton.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly vowed</a> to never do such a thing ever again.</p> <p> But what about companies like Wells Fargo, which kicked up its entry-level wage to $15 an hour? Surely this is a good sign? It sure is, except Wells Fargo’s own spokesman said <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-taxes-pay-20171221-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">it had nothing to do with the tax bill</a>. “We have been on a path to increasing the minimum hourly rate, having most recently increased it in January 2017,” spokesman Peter Gilchrist pointed out to the <i> LA Times</i>, only to change his mind a day later, saying it really was about the tax cut.</p> <p> Gilchrist should have stuck with his initial statement. States around the country, including California, where Wells Fargo has its headquarters and many branches, are <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/29/news/economy/2018-minimum-wage-increases/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">gradually increasing minimum wages</a> to $15 an hour. Those laws, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/target-to-raise-its-hourly-minimum-wage.html\" target=\"_blank\">companies like Target</a> escalating their own wages to retain staff in a tight labor market, seem like a better bet for wage hikes than the Trump tax cuts.</p> <p>By the way, we actually know what executives like those at Wells Fargo are thinking about the tax law, because the bank's CEO Tim Sloan <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/18/news/economy/wells-fargo-taxes/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN Money</a> the day the bill passed: “Is it our goal to increase return to our shareholders… yes. So our expectation should be that we will continue to increase our dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and the year after that.”</p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/ev5d9w/the-craziest-part-of-the-tax-plan-is-how-we-got-here?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=59wk9n&site=vice\"></iframe></div> <p> Dividends, a flat payout of profits to shareholders, and buybacks, a more roundabout way of taking shares off the market and thereby increasing the stock price artificially, both reward investors. And in the first ten days after the Senate advanced its version of the tax bill December 2—when everyone knew it was likely that a big corporate tax cut would pass—companies <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/18/tax-bill-corporate-rate-stock-buyback/\" target=\"_blank\">announced $70.2 billion</a> in stock buybacks. That included Boeing, announcer of planned workforce investments, with an additional $4 billion in buybacks; Bank of America, whose $5 billion buyback dwarfs its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/22/trump-says-tax-bill-is-the-rage-in-corporate-america-but-this-scorecard-shows-its-too-early-to-tell.html\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000 one-time bonus</a> to 145,000 workers; and JetBlue, whose <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/liberty-global-ups-shareholder-returns-with-2b-share-buyback-cm894896\" target=\"_blank\">$750 million in buybacks</a> also came alongside a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/04/jetblue-to-give-crew-members-1000-bonuses-after-tax-bill.html\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000 bonus announcement</a>.</p> <p> But the real corporate face of the tax cut is Pfizer. The drugmaker is said to have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-12-19/pfizer-buyback-dividend-hike-tax-cut-fruits\" target=\"_blank\">among the largest stash of money</a> of any corporation parked offshore, which under the tax law they can now bring back at a dramatically discounted rate. So how have they repaid workers since enjoying that windfall? They’ve <a href=\"https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2017/Pfizer-Declares-First-Quarter-2018-Dividend/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a $10 billion buyback, an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-buyback/pfizer-announces-new-10-billion-share-buyback-hikes-dividend-idUSKBN1EC281\" target=\"_blank\">increased dividend</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-pfizer-20180108-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">elimination of investment into research</a> on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, laying off 300 scientists and putting breakthroughs to fight those diseases further out of reach. (When reached for comment, Pfizer spokeswoman Neha Wadhwa told VICE that the research and shareholder payout decisions were &quot;totally independent of tax reform,&quot; and that the company would decide how to react to the tax changes alongside its earnings statement later this month.)</p> <p> In other words, these announcements are worse than a joke. They represent a deliberate strategy to curry favor with the public and President Trump while executives gorge themselves on tax cuts, most of which won’t trickle down to anyone. Corporations simply don’t make decisions based on taxes, and certainly not decisions to benefit workers over the long-term. These corporate PR departments are deceiving America to preserve an ideology of ultra-low taxes, and hoping nobody notices the truth.</p><p><i>Follow David Dayen on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ddayen\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. </i></p>",

Forty-eight percent of respondents favored Oprah, 38 percent backed Trump, and 14 percent were undecided. Notably, a surprising 22 percent of Republicans would vote for Oprah even though she'd presumably run as a Democrat. </p><p>There are a few big caveats here. For one, this is only a single poll.

Then there's the fact that according to her friend Gayle King, Oprah <a href=\"http://people.com/tv/gayle-king-on-oprah-running-for-president/\" target=\"_blank\">isn't considering running for anything</a>. Finally, if Oprah did run, she'd presumably face a Democratic primary field crowded with senators and other politicians—who knows if she would make it past Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, or any of the other dozen or so potential contenders?</p><p>But if nothing else, this poll shows that the Oprah 2020 speculation isn't dying down. People may not be taking it quite seriously yet, but people didn't take Trump seriously either. Trump himself didn't seem to be worried, judging by <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/mbppyq/trump-says-hed-beat-oprah-in-2020but-he-thinks-shed-be-fun\" target=\"_blank\">his response to a question about her on Tuesday</a>: “Yeah, I’ll beat Oprah.

They stay that way, shutting their bodies down, until warmer weather comes through.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://youtu.be/8yf9_g8Fsf0\" data-iframely-id=\"QxxfauX\"></div> <p>The swamp park's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shallotteriverswamppark/videos/768604326672879/\" target=\"_blank\">videos took off on Facebook</a>, where folks who were worried about the alligators' well-being asked how entombing one's reptilian self in ice could possibly be a good idea. &quot;If there is a heavy snow and covered their nose would they then die?&quot; one commenter <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shallotteriverswamppark/videos/767656473434331/?comment_id=769065146626797&reply_comment_id=769165929950052&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a>. &quot;Why don't you break up the ice for them?&quot; another <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shallotteriverswamppark/videos/767656473434331/?comment_id=769113873288591&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">wondered</a>.</p> <p>The swamp park assured everyone that the gators had evolved to act this way, and that they'd be fine. Once the ice had melted, the park posted a video of the beasts freeing themselves from their wintry prisons, and they began basking once more in the North Carolina sun.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://youtu.be/R9eDLGVVXzQ\" data-iframely-id=\"PF3ZdNy\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/PF3ZdNy?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>Next to showing no qualms about <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avybyp/this-video-of-a-gator-eating-another-gator-is-metal-as-hell-vgtrn\" target=\"_blank\">eating one another</a>, the whole phenomenon illustrates how gators will do just about anything to survive.

        "content": "<p>Last week, I was talking with my friend, a queer DJ named Mateo Segade, about gay nightlife here in LA. I work as a doorman at the Eagle, a gay bar, and Mateo is a DJ who plays queer events all over; between us, we’ve seen all sides of the gay nightlife industry, both for <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmw3a5/from-the-door-of-a-gay-bar-you-see-the-scope-of-lifeand-death\" target=\"_blank\">better</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ezkj5j/why-gay-men-need-to-get-past-masculinity\" target=\"_blank\">worse</a> (sometimes <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7bd9k/gay-bars-can-be-mind-bogglingly-racist\" target=\"_blank\">much, much worse</a>). </p><p>One of the worst parts of gay nightlife is how it can internalize and regurgitate the worst tendencies of queer communities. Queer people, especially gay men, are known for dealing with a slew of self-doubts and anxieties in noxious ways. Gay men are liable to feel incredibly insecure over their masculinity, a kind of internalized homophobia that leads them to idolize “masc 4 masc” “gaybros” and shame and oppress femme men. They’re sometimes sickeningly racist; it’s still not uncommon to see guys publicly declare a “preference” for white guys on their dating profiles, or openly exoticize and tokenize certain races. In various other ways—a resistance to the presence of women and non-cis gay men in their bars; a tendency towards groupthink in the way they dress, look and act—gay men often wear the trauma they’ve experienced from society and each other on their sleeves (or biceps, as it were). </p><p>So Mateo and I decided to make fun of it, and photoshop a fake poster for a night reflecting all that bullshit. Clint Yeager, one of my coworkers at The Eagle, threw out the name “Tox-Masc.” Soon enough, we were spitballing all kinds of funny taglines: “You Say Genderqueer, We Say Get Outta Here,” “Midnight Performances of Men Punching Each Other,” “No Drag Queens, Women Or Anything that Represents Them,” and “Only the Straightest Gogo Dancers Taking Your Gay Dollars.”</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1817624898271874&amp;set=a.578533772180999.1073741827.100000731457340\" data-iframely-id=\"gFL9xgE\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/gFL9xgE?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The next afternoon, Mateo’s flyer was on Facebook, and it seemed to really resonate. <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/hilarious-nightlife-poster-exemplifies-worst-gay-community-20180104\" target=\"_blank\">Gay</a> <a href=\"https://gcn.ie/flyer-tox-masc-goes-viral/\" target=\"_blank\">publications</a> wrote about it. Friends and strangers began emailing me about it, both with praise and condemnation. And those responses probably said more about gay nightlife than the poster ever could.</p><p>People sent me stories about their experiences with nights not dissimilar from our hyperbolic poster. “A few months ago I showed up at a gay bear bar here in San Francisco,” wrote a friend who identifies as genderfluid. (They asked I not disclose their name because of the nature of their story.) “I was dressed as a woman but I had my beard on, and was giving them gender-bending realness. The guy at the door told me I wasn’t welcome. I was stunned. Not welcome? Bitch, this is San Francisco. This is the one place I should <i> always</i> be welcome. The bar manager came out and literally told me to calm down, then to come back another time. That this wasn’t the ‘appropriate night’ for me. What the fuck does that even mean?”</p><p>“If that can happen in San Francisco, imagine what’s going on out there in the real fucking world,” they concluded. “It made me want to show them my big dick, wag it around at them in my dress, let them know where reality really is.”</p><p>“I once got a fifteen minute lecture at the door of a gay bar here in San Diego for even setting foot in there,” wrote <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/xanadurocketship/\" target=\"_blank\">Jess Keys, a.k.a. artist Xanadu Rocketship</a>, who identifies as a bisexual woman, performs at local drag shows and is a well-known drag ally. “I was meeting a friend after he was done [performing]. The door guy said things like, ‘Keep your gross hands to yourself. Don’t even make eye contact with anyone. If they get aggressive with you, security is gonna let them.’ Etc. Etc. ‘If we could legally ban women, we would. Most men in here hate women.’”</p><p>“Like I’m just gonna wander into the back room and start grabbing dicks!” she wrote.</p><p>There were also angry emails that decried the rising presence of women, drag queens and femmes at gay parties, which were infuriating, to say the least.</p><p>“I personally know of a few promoters who won’t hire me because of my work with drag, trans and queer audiences,” Mateo told me in a conversation during the aftermath. “They think it somehow lessens my appeal to hyper-masculine partygoers if I play for more inclusive crowds. Or that my music will be too ‘soft’ and ‘feminine.’”</p><p>Now, it should be noted that Mateo and I both often work at bars and nights that play into our poster’s tropes, places that sometimes have bear or masculine-leaning themes. And it’s not that those themes or communities are inherently bad. The bear community started as a home for gay people who felt rejected by the beauty standards imposed by the larger gay community, which are often so keenly felt that they cause <a href=\"https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/yppgej/how-coming-out-and-hating-your-body-are-linked\" target=\"_blank\">body dysmorphia</a> and worse. And at first glance, I myself am exactly what my poster is making fun of: I present as “masculine,” a reality I acknowledge but one that makes me feel silly, because I hate referring to myself with labels. I have a beard, I work out five days a week, and people construe me as a “bear” (again, a label I hate).</p><p>The thing is, I don’t think masculinity or one’s attraction to masculine attributes are necessarily evil or bad. It’s when that masculinity or attraction becomes toxic—when it leads to toxic behavior, becomes the penultimate way one defines what they’re attracted to, and leads them to marginalize others or erect divisions and walls between people—that it’s a problem. I might be masculine, but the word “masculine” alone is problematic to me. Like by saying “I’m masculine,” I’m somehow separating myself from other members of my community, calling attention to things that have very little to do with who I am as a human being.</p><hr><p><i>Watch therapist Zach Rawlings discuss body image issues in the gay community:<br></i></p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/gay-body-liberation/588f8cf08f1ad3ed786007dc\" data-iframely-id=\"iZCiLKj\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/iZCiLKj\"></iframe></div></div><hr><p>“People who have reacted negatively towards the flyer are guys who don’t know the difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity,” Mateo said. “They think we’re saying everyone should be wearing a dress or something. That’s not what this is about. There are plenty of ‘cool’ parties that celebrate conventional masculinity in a positive way. What we’re talking about are a set of stereotypical, fucked up behaviors that stem from negative influences from straight, white culture—and they’ve come to invade gay nightlife in lots of gross ways.”</p><p>I’m not trying to tell anyone who they should fuck or find attractive. Fuck who you want. That’s none of my business. What is my business—and should be all of our business—is how we treat each other as a community. </p><p>I’ve said this a lot, and I mean it: we’re living under enough oppression as it is in our society. We need to treat each other with extra kindness and beauty as a result. We should defend every member of our community—and this means the larger queer community and our allies—and their right to be the fucking amazing people they are. Did we really survive AIDS, centuries of religious and political intolerance, decades of overt intolerance across America and the fight for basic civil rights only to write “masc 4 masc” on a dating profile? We should celebrate the rights and acceptance we’ve seen by championing diversity. Be as masculine or femme or gender-bending as you want. Be who you are, and celebrate who we are, together. Because divisions only weaken our community, and that impulse to divide, more often than not, is one we inherit from those who have sought to oppress us for ages. We’re only as strong as the strength and cohesion of our community.</p><p>And fuck anyone tries to tell you you don’t belong in a queer space.

My answer is this column, “Woman Seeing Woman.” While it’s just the start of solving this problem, I, a female writer and photographer, hope to celebrate the astoundingly powerful female voices we have in photography by offering a glimpse into their work. </i></p> <p>Whenever I think of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zorasicher/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Zora Sicher</a>’s work, the first image that comes to mind is a young woman in a burgundy swimsuit sitting on the stoop of a Brooklyn brownstone. The woman stares into the lens unperturbed by, and even challenging, its presence. I was captivated and unable to look away, a difficult experience to engender in me as a person who sees so a lot of photography professionally and lives in our current, highly visual landscape. </p> <p>The image was published during the summer of 2016 in a <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/34-fresh-swimsuits-out-on-the-hot-town.html\" target=\"_blank\">print spread and online slideshow</a> by <i>New York Magazine</i>’s The Cut. It was part of a feature that tasked photographers with photographing their friends in the season’s best swimwear. Sicher had gathered her friends in that Brooklyn brownstone. And she shot them on film as they sat and talked and laughed and leaned and stared with their swimsuits wrinkling and their hair frizzing.</p> <p>All the photos in Sicher’s contributions to the slideshow feel like a look inside a person’s life. They're a pleasant deviation from the made-up faces and well-oiled bodies in swimsuit spreads usually foist upon us. This, I would learn, was not just a directive from The Cut, but Sicher’s own style. Her work for <a href=\"https://pringlescotland.com/pages/zora-sicher-for-pringle-of-scotland\" target=\"_blank\">Pringle of Scotland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/36580/1/portraits-of-mexicos-citys-creative-new-wave-zora-sicher-barragan-guerxs\" target=\"_blank\">Dazed</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/ultimate-fall-trend-fashion-shopping-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Allure</a> all evoke this sentiment.

It has a lot to do with the relationship between me and the person I’m photographing,” Sicher told me over the phone. She was in Mexico, where she's spent time on and off for the last few months and where she will be curating an exhibition this coming February. “I think you can tell that there’s a conversation between how the person wants to be represented [and] my lens.” She wondered if some male photographers don’t question, respect, or explore that dialogue between subject—especially female subject—and photographer the way some women do. “I’m so sick of this thing where I don’t feel like there’s any conversation between the man who’s photographing the woman. It’s like, <i>This is the way I want to see you, this is what’s happening.</i>” Sicher, when we spoke, was over it. </p> <p>For a long time, she said, that dialogue was missing in her own work. But as she began to develop conversations with her subjects, meaning began to develop, too. “I’m in a part of my life where I just want to talk to people all the time. I want to understand where all these different people come from,” Sicher explained. “I never really wanted to be the quiet photographer.”</p><div><picture><source

        "content": "<p><i>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk\" target=\"_blank\">VICE UK</a>.<br><br>Everyone's favorite dystopian tech-anxiety anthology series </i> Black Mirror<i> has returned with six new episodes. </i>VICE <i>is exploring some of the ideas raised in these episodes with the help of key figures in the show, as well the wider world of science and technology. Read the first one, about the &quot;USS Callister&quot; episode, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbpvzv/charlie-brooker-talks-to-us-about-uss-callister\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</i></p> <p>&quot;Arkangel&quot;—the second episode of season four of <i>Black Mirror</i>—is a story about a tracker parents can implant in their children. It allows them to keep tabs on where their kids are, see through their eyes, and even block dangerous content from their view. What starts as a story of overprotective parenting gets, in true <i>Black Mirror</i> fashion, much darker.</p> <p>This interview with Charlie Brooker about the episode contains spoilers.</p> <p><b>VICE: So how did you come to writing &quot;Arkangel?&quot; It felt like an episode only a parent could write.<br></b><b>Charlie Brooker: </b>Yeah, it did come from that. It feels cliché to say, but I did sort of feel reprogrammed the moment my kids were born—suddenly, I’ve got a new mission, which is to protect them. At the same time, they’re born into a world where there's technology around them, and they're immediately tested by it.</p> <p><b>Children are also so often at the frontline of technological advancement. They adapt to new technology quicker than anyone.<br></b>Totally. My five-year-old just completed <i>Super Mario</i> over the weekend, which I’m inordinately proud of. But yeah, it felt like the topic we have't done yet. Often in our episodes, we present a sort of technological gismo that gives people great power, and you can understand why they use it. The Arkangel system [the character] uses is a very attractive thing to use; it would be very hard for many parents to not agree to use that. And at that point, are you just overstepping the mark? Hopefully, people who are parents will go, &quot;Oh, that's me,&quot; and people who have overprotective parents will look at it and see some aspects of their life in there. </p> <p><b>So, on the one hand, there's the tracking element, knowing what your kids are seeing and doing. And then there's this added functionality about blocking out distressing things.<br></b>Yeah, it’s also about censorship. But sometimes I struggle to answer these questions because I don’t think about the themes too much, in a way, when I’m writing them. I sort of think about the characters, or I’m thinking, <i>Oh, that would be interesting if that happened, then this would happen</i>—a bit like a computer programmer. Then this, then that.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yef_HfQoBd8\" data-iframely-id=\"vfql66L\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/vfql66L?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p><b>I suppose that's a balance you must always have to strike on <i>Black Mirror</i> because the newsy coverage of the show focuses on the technology and what it's saying about the future. But as a writer, it's only interesting to have those futuristic concepts if you care about what happens to the characters.<br></b>Hopefully. I mean, the stories start out as weird little &quot;what if&quot; ideas, which I use to horrify the other people on the show. But then the next step is &quot;Okay, let's imagine it is an actual scenario.&quot; Who's caught up in that? You're then also constantly trying to make the viewer care about it. I think the show is often quite visceral generally because it goes to more extremes than you're expecting often—probably in an attempt to go, &quot;Pay attention to this, we’ve only got an hour.&quot;</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"> <iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/embed/article/mbpvzv/charlie-brooker-talks-to-us-about-uss-callister?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=8xvd4b&site=vice\"></iframe> </div> <p><b>It’s not that often that you have young kids on the show—did that present unique challenges?<br></b>Well, obviously it was Jodie Foster who directed that, so who better to deal with child actors, literally. I think she was performing from the age of three, which is crazy. I didn't get to go to the set because they shot it in Canada—I was staying home. But she was very good with the cast and everything.</p> <p><b>How did it come about that she directed the episode?<br></b>Well, she had a relationship with Netflix. She'd done <i>House of Cards </i>and <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>, so they put her in touch with us. We sent her the script and she liked it. She came back with lots of feedback. She's really, really normal. Really, for someone who’s had all that experience in her life, she's very, very grounded. I mean, I don’t know how you pull that off. She was a pleasure to talk to and to work with. And she flew over here for the editing. We edited it in Twickenham, London.</p> <p><b> This episode made me think a bit. I have my friends and my girlfriend on the Find My Friends app on my iPhone. I can look and see where they are right now.<br></b>Do they know that you do this?</p> <p><b> Yeah, they have to agree—we all follow each other. One time a friend went back to their ex-boyfriend's house when they said they were done with them, and we all saw the next morning. We were straight on the group thread like, &quot;We can see you're in Holloway!&quot;<br></b>Wow.</p> <p><b> Is that bad?<br></b> That's very bad! Isn't it? At least you're not looking through their eyes and seeing what they're doing, so it isn't that bad. </p> <p><b> I feel bad now. But that’s a preloaded Apple app, so lots of people must do it.<br></b>They give their permission for you to see their whereabouts? Has anybody ever signed out?</p> <p><b> Yes, when people—for example—start a new relationship, they might want a few months off.<br></b>What, away from the peering eye in the sky that you apparently are?</p> <p><b> Oh God, it's really bad, isn't it?<br></b>Yeah, that is a bit weird.</p> <p><b> But I also identify with the sense of comfort in which the mom in &quot;Arkangel&quot; gets, just seeing people moving around, and knowing they're alive and well. I could see, as a parent or a guardian, it's such an obvious tool to want.<br></b>I imagine that you can get GPS kits for kids' shoes. So it doesn't surprise me in the slightest that that stuff exists. I haven't had cause to use it at the moment because my kids are so young, but certainly, I’ve talked to people whose parents use Find My Friends in a similar way—to keep track of their teenage kids and stuff like that. I can understand the impulse and the want to do that, but you're basically a spy. You're spying on a person, and invading their privacy. And an obvious way to do that within the story was to lean into the intimate moments of their lives, then pry into it. It's quite a dilemma.</p> <p><i>Follow Sam Wolfson on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samwolfson\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. </i></p>",

        "content": "<p>Ridley Scott's Getty kidnapping biopic, <i>All the Money in the World</i>, has been widely praised for doing what seemed basically impossible: <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8x5kmx/kevin-spacey-is-getting-edited-out-of-his-latest-movie-vgtrn\" target=\"_blank\">editing disgraced actor Kevin Spacey out of the finished film</a> and replacing him with actor Christopher Plummer a month before its release. </p><p>The move was completely unprecedented and seemed to be made possible only because of the dedication of the film's cast and crew. In an <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/12/19/michelle-williams-mark-wahlberg-reshot-kevin-spaceys-all-money-scenes-free/966670001/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with <i>USA Today</i> last month</a>, Scott praised his team for coming back to work for free, saying that he and the actors &quot;did [the reshoots] for nothing.&quot; Now, it looks like Scott's statement wasn't entirely true. </p><p>Multiple sources <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/09/exclusive-wahlberg-paid-1-5-m-all-money-reshoot-williams-got-less-than-1-000/1018351001/\" target=\"_blank\">told <i>USA </i><i>Today</i></a> recently that <i>All the Money in the World</i> actor Mark Wahlberg actually negotiated a $1.5 million payout for the reshoots—while his co-star, Michelle Williams, made an $80 per diem, totaling less than $1,000.</p><p>According to <i>USA Today</i>, Williams was unaware that she was being paid less than 1 percent of her male co-star's fee for the same reshoots. The actress previously said that she offered to do the reshoots for free because she appreciated Scott's &quot;massive effort&quot; in response to Spacey's <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz3ggx/eight-house-of-cards-crew-members-accuse-kevin-spacey-of-sexual-misconduct-vgtrn\" target=\"_blank\">numerous sexual assault allegations</a>.</p><p>&quot;I said I'd be wherever they needed me, whenever they needed me,&quot; Williams said in the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/12/19/michelle-williams-mark-wahlberg-reshot-kevin-spaceys-all-money-scenes-free/966670001/\" target=\"_blank\">same December interview</a>. &quot;And they could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted.&quot;</p><p>The news of the massive pay gap is a strange twist in the otherwise successful story of the film, which earned Christopher Plummer a Golden Globe nomination. <i>Molly's Game</i> star Jessica Chastain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jes_chastain/status/950909603377643521\" target=\"_blank\">responded to the news on Twitter</a>, writing that Williams is &quot;a brilliant Oscar-nominated [and] Golden Globe-winning actress&quot; who &quot;deserves more than 1% of her male costar's salary.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is so messed up that it is almost hard to believe,&quot; director Judd Apatow wrote in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddApatow/status/950917449200775169\" target=\"_blank\">own tweet</a>. &quot;Almost.&quot;</p>",

We <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqk5xb/the-vice-guide-to-cuffing\" target=\"_blank\">guided you gently</a> through cuffing season—like your first boyfriend gingerly taking your hand and placing it on his crotch—but we got it wrong. We, like <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/cuffing-season-winter-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">everyone else</a> who has written about cuffing season, thought it went from late September and October to &quot;spring.&quot; In fact, it comes in two parts (stick with us). </p> <p>When the gentle, even wistful autumnal vibe gives way to the primal and desperate urges of January; when your vibrator churns out a low death rattle before finally quitting of exhaustion; when you find yourself not even craving sex anymore, just someone to breathe near you until you remember how to be a person, cuffing season is over. Clearing season has begun.</p> <p>Clearing season is a system used by modern humans as a last ditch attempt to fill time before the start of the summer. When those single people who—whether by circumstance or choice—did not successfully cuff before the end of the year begin to twitch. There’s only so much time you can spend alone before you deaden all your nerve endings and start looking at anyone who performs a basic act of kindness with fresh eyes. &quot;How was your weekend?&quot; someone who's worked in your office for years asks, and you think: <i>Maybe... I like... them</i>??</p> <p>While cuffing season is vague, impulsive, and exciting—driven by the spiritual and elemental—clearing season is definitive, urgent, and dark. It’s DM or die. Plough or perish. Grab someone from the universe and start layering lasagna with them immediately, or spend January through March on (alleged) self-imposed abstinence watching many, many documentaries about serial killers.</p> <h2> The Post-Christmas Drive</h2> <p>You’re doing dry January and Veganuary and Gratituduary, or whatever the fuck else, to feel useful. You’ve given up literally everything that gives you joy and you've taken up other activities, like &quot;running,&quot; or watching the IMDB Top 250 because it’s a fun, cultural thing to do. But before you reach <i> The Green Mile</i>, you realize the &quot;fun&quot; has gone. And if you make it to<i> Das Boot</i>, something primal skewers you in the gut. </p><p>Staying in and staring at a laptop shifts from being the very essence of coziness to hurling you into an existential hole. One minute you’re in a warm meditative state; the next, you're trying to remember if you ever saw your dad kiss your mom, or distilling your past relationships down to real feeling and ranking them, or maybe asking yourself that eternal question: Will I ever love again? Will I though? </p><p>The most sexually experienced breeze through Sept-Dec evading what they thought was cuffing season, only to come face to face with clearing season, which in turn feels a lot like facing their very humanity. Natalie from your WhatsApp group has gone from the one most likely to say &quot;finger me there&quot; to the one most likely to plead &quot;can you stroke my hair?&quot; </p><h2> The Clearing</h2> <p>Unlike cuffing season—or life generally—clearing season rarely involves necking the best of a bottle of Southern Comfort, waking up the next day in a friend-of-a-friend’s bed, maybe with cum in your hair, and then spending the next eight to 12 weeks in a pseudo-relationship built exclusively on wholesome memes and butt stuff. January is a dark month. Everyone who can has fucked off to Melbourne for an extra long Christmas break; everyone else is too busy lying to themselves to go out drinking or socializing. </p><p>So don't expect to find any potential clearing partners until about the third week of January, when millions of pairs of adidas Boosts have been retired for yet another year.</p> <div><picture><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515521818676-clearing222.jpeg\"></picture><div></div></div><h2>Valentine’s Day</h2> <p>There’s something a little fresh about September to November hook-ups. There’s a <i> Love Actually</i> synchronicity to the December hook-up. But unless you’ve met a new person full of hope and promise, there’s something inherently cynical about the clearing season hook-up. If it’s an ex, someone you’ve flirted with for ages or a previous hook-up, therein lies a very likely problem: a lack of honest passion. You both know the proper and righteous thing would have been to have sex in time for Christmas, but someone couldn’t be bothered.</p> <p>Your pairing almost certainly fits one of these two classifications:<br><br><i>1. One person knows or suspects it’s clearing and the other has secretly been waiting for this moment for three years.</i><br><br><i>2. Both of you know deep down it’s a load of shit.</i></p> <p>If you're having trouble deciding, never fear: Saint Valentine will coax out the truth. Nothing brings clarity to your intentions like a day dedicated to contemplating the feelings you supposedly have for the person you’re dating. </p> <h2> Free Time</h2> <p>The main driving factor in all of this is, of course, free time—fucking loads of it. There are plenty of afternoons from January through March to eat lukewarm soup at your desk, browse weekend hotel breaks that &quot;actually wouldn’t be too much if there were two of you,&quot; and contemplate everyone you blew off over the last six months. You think you want it, the relationship, but you don’t really, you fickle little prick; all you'll end up doing is shacking up, feeling instantly trapped, leveraging a minor political disagreement as a reason to break it off, and then getting a full STI check-in time for summer.</p> <h2> The End </h2> <p>There is something Biblical about all of this, almost. Lent begins in February and concludes at the end of March, with Easter soon to follow. Historically, it is the season of declining anything that may bring you a hint of pleasure, whether it be unsaturated fats or fucking anything that moves. </p><p>As Christians are freed from their period of abstinence to go absolutely buck wild on a short stack, we too are released from our impulse to cling for dear life to the closest available person, and freed to go buck wild between the legs of others. It’s ingrained in us. It's a part of our vile DNA. It's a part of the wider movements of Earth.</p><p>From badlands to holy ground, with God’s help you will be free from the shackles of a convenience relationship once again. That is, until the following September and every September after that, until you find someone decent or grow up or die. <br><br><i>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hannahrosewens\" target=\"_blank\">Hannah Ewens</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmaggarland\" target=\"_blank\">Emma Garland</a> on Twitter.</i></p>",

Passed more than a year ago, the proposition promised to make it legal for those 21 and over to buy weed, and the first recreational dispensaries opened on New Year’s Day.</p> <p>But the less heralded feature of the bill is the change it brings to the criminal justice system—a testament to the legacy of pot criminalization at a time when, despite some <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev5avz/its-time-for-democrats-to-go-all-in-on-weed\" target=\"_blank\">old-school holdouts in the federal government</a>, mainstream social acceptance seems within reach.</p> <p>“In November 2016 when Prop 64 passed, immediately, as of the next day, individuals that had charges that would have been either misdemeanors under Prop. 64 or completely legal under Prop 64 had the right to go back to court to petition to have their records to be changed,” said attorney Eric Shevin, of the Los Angeles-based Shevin Law Group. “Many people were unaware of it… [and are] still unaware of it.&quot;</p> <p>In addition to <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/prop64.htm\" target=\"_blank\">reclassifying</a> many marijuana-related felonies as misdemeanors and legalizing crimes like personal possession or cultivation, Prop 64 goes one step further to apply these laws retroactively. California’s legalization initiative was unique in including this provision—although a smattering of other states, including Colorado, have (whether via legislation or court-order) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/us/colorado-court-says-some-marijuana-convictions-could-be-challenged.html\" target=\"_blank\">adopted similar policies</a> in the era of recreational weed. </p> <p>California’s effort is intended in large part to address the decades of law enforcement that has disproportionately impacted minority communities. In Los Angeles alone, black residents make up just 9 percent of the city’s population, but accounted for accounted for 40 percent of cannabis-related arrests between 2000 and 2017, according to LAPD data.</p> <p>“All the marijuana convictions in California was basically like a guinea-pig drill for them to see... how much money they can make,” Fentaw said of the now-legal industry. “I feel like we owed.”</p> <p>While individuals can submit the paperwork for reclassification and expungement themselves, it can be a complicated and time-consuming process. Shefin's firm is currently handling about a dozen of these cases, and some take up to a few months to complete. Meanwhile, there’s a huge swath of California residents, who—because of these prior convictions—are prevented from landing well-paying jobs, safe homes, student grants and a litany of other necessities. </p> <p>“We know within the last ten years there have been at least 500,000 marijuana arrests in the state of California, even when we had legal medical marijuana,” said Eunisses Hernandez, policy coordinator with the Los Angeles office of the DPA. “Going back ten more years, we’re sure the numbers are even double that.”</p> <p>But as of January 1, the state had received fewer <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/Prop64-Filings.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">than 5,000</a> court petitions for re-sentencing or reclassification under Proposition 64. (Hernandez suspected the number might be higher, as some jurisdictions may not have fully reported applications yet.) The relatively middling turnout may be due to an overall lack of investment in outreach: Government officials and industry members have spent much of their energy developing commercial regulations for cannabis, something Hernandez hopes will change now that the landmark January 1 date has passed and recreational weed is legal.</p> <p>“Marijuana cases are trickling in but its not at the rate we know is out there,” she told me. </p><p>When reached via email, Alex Traverso, chief of communications for California's Bureau of Cannabis Control, agreed that official efforts thus far have been focused on recreational marijuana regulations and licensing. &quot;Education and outreach for [expunging records] wasn’t really given to any one agency, so it seems that more is being done at the local level to highlight this option for people who choose to clear their record,&quot; he told me. (On Tuesday, State Assemblyman Rob Bonta of Oakland proposed a law that would make the pot-conviction expungement process automatic, putting responsibility directly on the court system rather than individuals, as the <i> LA Times </i><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-lawmaker-proposes-easier-1515529046-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.)</p><p>The DPA—along with partners the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office, and others—have been trying to turn a trickle of applications into a stream via social media, work with community partners, and expungement fairs. At these events, attorneys and paralegals help people with criminal histories navigate the complex web of paperwork. The process is free, a big deal in itself as attorneys can charge up to $3,000 for the same service, according to Pamela Johnson, a public information officer at the LA County Public Defender’s Office, which has been participating in about eight expungement clinics a month. On a single day, they see anywhere from about 75 to 300 people—many facing multiple charges, she said. (The event I attended in LA brought out about 75 people.)</p> <p>People like Anthony Turner, a 36-year-old black man who drove product from Northern California’s famed weed epicenter, the Emerald Triangle, to Southern California, while attending college at Sacramento State. After two years in the game, Turner was arrested and charged with multiple counts including possession, transportation and distribution of marijuana, he said. After attending an expungement fair last year, Turner said he got his flagrant felony charge dropped to misdemeanor possession.</p> <p>“I would never have done 12 years in prison... if this law was in place,” he told me.</p> <p>Turner is in the minority at these events, with most attendees tackling other charges like weapons convictions and property crimes. That’s because when the DPA started these clinics three years ago, they were intended to assist Californians impacted by <a href=\"https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/news/prop47.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proposition 47</a>—another initiative reducing some drug felonies to misdemeanors and reduces sentencing for some other nonviolent crimes.</p> <p>Now, organizers hope an increasing number of people will take advantage of the era of legal weed and clear their names. “I just think it expands more opportunity for more people to get their lives back together,” said Miriam Singer, a paralegal and volunteer at the event.</p> <p>All this progress doesn’t come without a bit of blowback though.</p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/gqkvy9/how-california-is-giving-people-with-criminal-records-a-second-chance?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=gywwej&site=vice\"></iframe></div> <p>Just last week—a mere three days after California legalized the sale of creational marijuana for adults—Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qnpn/even-republicans-hate-jeff-sessionss-new-weed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">rescinded the Obama-era Cole memo</a>, which was widely credited with allowing the marijuana industry to flourish under a hands-off approach from the federal government. In its place, Sessions redirected enforcement to US attorneys operating within individual states, which means the fate of marijuana businesses will depend largely on their location. </p> <p>While this is unlikely to dramatically impact the core of California’s cannabis industry, the ancillary businesses—such as banks and investors, who were just beginning to warm up to weed —may be a bit spooked, according to Sean O’Connor, a law professor and founder of the Cannabis Law and Policy Project at the University of Washington. Even if the feds decide to start targeting commercial cannabis activity, it likely wouldn’t impede California’s independent ability to decriminalize the drug and expunge past marijuana convictions on the state level, he noted. </p> <p>Shevin, the attorney, took the sentiment a step further, describing Sessions's move as “idiotic” and emphasizing that if the feds wanted to go after weed in California, they could have already done so.</p><p>“We have to remember that cannabis reform has happened on the heels of civil disobedience,” he told me. “Knowing that it’s illegal in the eyes of the feds is nothing new.”</p><p><i>This article has been updated to include news of a California state lawmaker's proposed tweak to the expungement process.</i><br></p><p><i>Follow Hayley Fox on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPfox\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

Ontario’s minimum wage jumped to $14 an hour at the beginning of the year. This jump—introduced in <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/whats-in-ontarios-massive-new-labour-bill-a-minimum-wage-hike-but-much-much-more\" target=\"_blank\">a November bill</a> and seen by some as a way for Ontario Premier [head of government of a province or territory] Kathleen Wynne to gain some votes going into an upcoming election—will see wages jump to $15 an hour in 2019. </p> <p>Now, in response to those actions, some Tim Hortons owners are facing down rallies and boycotts planned by labor activists and some everyday Canadians.</p> <p>Most of the ire is directed at one store, located in Cobourg, Ontario in particular. This store is owned by Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce (Tim Horton’s daughter) and Ron Joyce Jr. (the son of Ron Joyce, who co-founded the chain) and was the most high profile to fuck over their employees in response to the minimum wage increase. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ronald-joyce/&refURL=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7xe48a/tim-hortons-heirs-are-getting-roasted-after-blaming-new-minimum-wage-for-benefit-cuts&referrer=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7xe48a/tim-hortons-heirs-are-getting-roasted-after-blaming-new-minimum-wage-for-benefit-cuts\" target=\"_blank\">According to <i> Forbes</i></a>, Ron Joyce Jr.’s father is worth is about $1.4 billion. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7xe48a/tim-hortons-heirs-are-getting-roasted-after-blaming-new-minimum-wage-for-benefit-cuts\" data-iframely-id=\"4dR4ZTg\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/4dR4ZTg?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>A <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3951812/protest-planned-at-tim-hortons-in-cobourg-in-wake-of-employees-benefit-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">rally is planned</a> outside the Cobourg Tim Hortons on Wednesday and it’s not the only one.

In a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/books/review/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-trump-white-house.html?module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=Book&_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> for the <i>New York Times</i>, national political correspondent Jonathan Martin writes, &quot;Wolff is unsparing in his portrayal of Trump as an aberrant chief executive, not only detached from governance but barely literate.&quot; Specifically, Wolff claims that members of the president's cabinet <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/vby3pj/12-shocking-things-from-that-book-about-trumps-white-house\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> him &quot;dumb as shit&quot; and &quot;a hopeless idiot.&quot; </p><p>Those juicy tidbits have turned the book into a sensation: The first 150,000 copies printed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/09/fire-and-fury-flies-off-shelves-with-publisher-rushing-to-print-1m-copies\" target=\"_blank\">sold out</a> within days, and it is the most pirated book in <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmqqe4/fire-and-fury-piracy-michael-wolff\" target=\"_blank\">recent memory</a>. Its popularity has undoubtedly been stoked by the <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/3k5v4b/trump-threatens-to-sue-fire-and-fury-publisher-to-stop-the-books-release\" target=\"_blank\">cease-and-desist</a> letter Trump's lawyers sent to the book's author and publisher and the president's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949498795074736129\" target=\"_blank\">tweets</a> calling Wolff &quot;a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book.&quot;</p><p>But there are a lot of questions about how truthful the book is. In his review, Martin noted that <i>Fire and Fury</i> had at least a few glaring factual inaccuracies, and many other journalists have also taken issue with individual errors. So I want to point out something that, if not exactly a mistake, is an odd turn of phrase that shows how idiosyncratic Wolff's book is. I want to talk about &quot;Jarvanka.&quot;</p><p>That's how Wolff refers to power couple Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner on 49 occasions. &quot;Bannon... coined the Jarvanka conflation now in ever greater use,&quot; Wolff writes in the chapter titled &quot;Jarvanka.&quot;</p><p>But prior to the release of <i>Fire and Fury, </i>Jared and Ivanka had never been referred to as Jarvanka, but rather &quot;Javanka,&quot; no <i>r</i>. &quot;'Javanka' Is the Perfect Celebrity Nickname for Our Strange Era,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/03/07/regarding-javanka-the-celebrity-couple-name-of-our-strange-era/\" target=\"_blank\">a March 2017 <i>Washingtonian</i></a> headline reads. &quot;Javanka Moved Personal Email Accounts to Trump Organization Computers,&quot; an <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/10/03/report-javanka-moved-personal-email-accounts-to-trump-organization-computers/\" target=\"_blank\">October 2017 Breitbart</a> headline reports. In fact, Breitbart, which Steve Bannon was in charge of until about 20 minutes ago, has used &quot;Javanka&quot; to refer to Trump's daughter and son-in-law as a collective unit up until the release of <i><a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/05/mcmaster-jarvanka-dina-powell-backed-sending-up-to-7k-troops-to-afghanistan/\" target=\"_blank\">Fire and Fury</a>.</i></p><p>So where did &quot;Jarvanka&quot; come from?</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/heres-sean-spicer-trying-to-defend-trumps-tweets-about-nordstrom-dropping-ivanka/589ba2260f5c09ed7b46b2f6\" data-iframely-id=\"JSCNRdu\"></div><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/trump-vs-athletes/59c96a83021b211b720df071\" data-iframely-id=\"EUqK7So\"></div><p>On Twitter, Jonathan Martin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmartNYT/status/950799766795022338\" target=\"_blank\">told me</a> he &quot;had the same Q&quot; about how Javanka became Jarvanka.</p><p>&quot;Bannon say ‘Javanka,’&quot; one White House reporter messaged me. &quot;Everybody in the pro-Trump orbit who I’ve heard refer to the couple as such says ‘Javanka.’ I can’t speak to every other Trump White House reporter, but I’m fairly certain ‘JARvanka’ is not canon. When I saw that in the Wolff book, I thought it was just a typo at first.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Bannon calls them Javanka, not Jarvanka. I maybe have heard him say Jarvanka once or twice. But it’s always Javanka, I am pretty sure. And that’s what like the Bannon contingent calls them too,&quot; another White House reporter explained to me.</p><p>&quot;I don't think I've ever heard Jarvanka, just Javanka,&quot; a third White House reporter said.</p><p>When I reached out to Breitbart's White House reporter Charlie Spiering with my Ja(r)vanka inquiry, he responded with a single shrug emoji.</p><p>Still, Wolff stands by <i>Jarvanka</i>. &quot;[Steve Bannon] calls them Jarvanka,&quot; he wrote in an email to me. &quot;I liked the sound of that better—had a kind of prehistoric beast ring, I thought. Javanka sounds a bit Scandinavian.&quot;</p><p>That lines up with a common critique of <i>Fire and Fury</i>, which is that Wolff sacrificed journalistic rigor and accuracy for whatever sounded best. As <i>New York Times </i>White House reporter Maggie Haberman <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/01/05/haberman_wolff_creates_a_narrative_that_is_notionally_true_the_details_are_often_wrong.html\" target=\"_blank\">said on CNN</a>, &quot;[Wolff] believes in larger truths and narratives. So he creates a narrative that is notionally true, that's conceptually true. The details are often wrong.&quot; </p><p><i>Follow Eve Peyser on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/evepeyser\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

George W. Bush was usually in the Oval Office by 6:45 AM, while the chiller Obama rolled into work between nine and ten. But <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-trumps-secret-shrinking-schedule-1515364904-ab76374a-6252-4570-a804-942b3f851840.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to a scoop this week from Axios</a>, Trump only spends about seven hours a day in the Oval Office, from 11AM to 6PM.</p><p>While the report notes that Trump worked longer hours during the beginning of his presidency, he has demanded more &quot;executive time,&quot; which is the fancy way of saying time spent tweeting, making phone calls, and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zm3a83/i-watched-15-hours-of-fox-and-friends-and-i-want-to-die\" target=\"_blank\">watching his beloved cable news</a>. &quot;The schedule says Trump has 'Executive Time' in the Oval Office every day from 8am to 11am, but the reality is he spends that time in his residence, watching TV, making phone calls and tweeting,&quot; Axios's Jonathan Swan reported.</p><p>While Trump's critics are eager to berate him for being lazy, he may be onto something. In 1940, congress amended the <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42713.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> to mandate overtime pay for employees working over 40 hours a week. Since then, an eight-hour workday has been the norm, but in a world that is increasingly automated, do we need to be working so much?</p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/yvqqxw/who-stole-the-four-hour-workday-0000406-v21n8?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=gywwpq&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>&quot;It used to be common sense that advances in technology would bring more leisure time,&quot; Nathan Schneider <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvqqxw/who-stole-the-four-hour-workday-0000406-v21n8\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> for VICE back in 2014. &quot;A four-hour workday with a livable wage could solve a lot of our most nagging problems. If everyone worked fewer hours, for instance, there would be more jobs for the unemployed to fill.&quot; And yet, it's 2018 and my computer job requires me to be in the office from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM five days a week.</p><p>As leftist wonk Matt Bruenig explained on <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/blog/7/16/15/should-americans-work-more-absolutely-not\" target=\"_blank\">Demos</a> in 2015, &quot;Normally, when a country increases its per-hour productivity, it reduces the amount of work it does... Given our high GDP/hour, there is absolutely no reason the US needs to be working as much as we currently do, and certainly no reason why we need to be working more.&quot;</p><p>Anyone who has an actual job will tell you that the reason they work long hours is that they're paid by the hour, duh. The path to a seven-hour day—or a four-hour day, or a zero-hour day—would necessarily involve pretty widespread societal change. Without either a massive increase in the minimum wage or something more radical like a guaranteed universal basic income, no one could afford to work Trumpian hours. (At the federal minimum wage of $7.25, if you worked 35 hours a week for an entire year with no vacation, you'd only make $13,200.)<br></p><p>But unlike most jobs, the job of president can't be automated, at least not until real AI exists and humans become obsolete. So perhaps Trump should be working more. But I'm hoping he's committed to a seven-hour day to remind Americans that they're employers are working them too hard, that we all deserve a little more &quot;executive time.&quot;</p><p><i>Follow Eve Peyser on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/evepeyser\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

Given that <a href=\"https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/vvkwpy/legal-marijuana-is-solution-to-opioid-painkiller-problem-weedweek2017\" target=\"_blank\">study after study suggests marijuana availability</a> is linked to lower overdose death rates, reduced use of opioids for chronic pain, and lower rates of opioid addiction, a stranger, more ill-advised policy is hard to imagine.</p> <p>Though <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d34xza/the-stoners-guide-to-trumps-new-weed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">some US attorneys have said that they will not change their priorities</a> in response— and there has been a huge political backlash—the threat of a crackdown will inevitably have a chilling effect on the nascent pot industry. While Congress still prohibits federal money being spent to interfere with medical weed in the states that have it, that provision <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/sessions-medical-marijuana/549719/\" target=\"_blank\">expires</a> on January 19, and may not be included in the next budget.</p> <p>To understand just how counterproductive it would be to legally target weed right now, it’s worth looking closely at the growing body of data suggesting that pot may be preventing he opioid epidemic from being even deadlier. At least 11 studies have analyzed the effects of marijuana on opioid use for chronic pain, as well as its connections with opioid-overdose deaths and addiction rates. Ten of them found strong positive associations, meaning that more marijuana availability was associated with less harm from opioids.</p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/marijuana-legalization/592c9a1ddf58602b5e9daea0\" data-iframely-id=\"0y9CnL9\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/0y9CnL9\"></iframe></div></div> <hr><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4392651/\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> published in <i> JAMA Internal Medicine</i> in 2014 analyzed the relationship between a state’s legalization of medical marijuana and its opioid overdose death rate, using data from 1999 through 2010 in all 50 states. It found that overall, medical cannabis legalization was associated with a 25 percent reduction in overdose deaths— and that the longer the laws were in effect, the greater the decline. Indeed, states that had such laws for six years saw a 33 percent reduction in fatalities.</p> <p>“The fact that we are seeing decline of fatal overdose by 25 percent in states with legal medical marijuana, although it doesn’t show causation, it certainly shows a correlation that all of us need to stand up and take notice of,” said Dr. David Nathan, a distinguished psychiatrist and founder of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, “It’s quite intuitive that cannabis, both as an adjunct to and replacement for opioids, would lead to a favorable outcome given that cannabis is much less toxic.&quot;</p> <p>Another <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w21345.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, conducted by researchers at the nonpartisan Rand Corporation and published as a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2015, found that medical marijuana availability was linked with reductions in both the opioid overdose death rate and the rate at which people sought treatment for opioid addiction. In states that had the greatest access to medical marijuana via dispensaries, treatment admissions related to opioids were reduced by 28 percent—while overdose death rates fell by 31 percent. Like <i> the JAMA Internal Medicine</i> study, this research also showed that the effect became larger over time. </p> <p>A third <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304059?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> published in the <i> American Journal of Public Health</i> looked specifically at Colorado and found that its legalization of recreational marijuana sales in 2012 (it <a href=\"http://sensiblecolorado.org/history-of-co-medical-marijuana-laws/\" target=\"_blank\">legalized</a> medical marijuana in 2000, but did not have dispensaries until 2007) was connected with a 6.5 percent reduction in opioid related deaths. Another study in the same journal <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27631755?log$=activity\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that the percentage of drivers involved in car crashes with opioids in their systems declined among drivers between 21 and 40 in medical marijuana states.</p> <p>Weed seems to substitute for opioids both when it comes to treating chronic pain and providing an alternative means of recreation for some who misuse painkillers. And while no one sane believes pot is a panacea that can completely replace opioids for pain or eliminate the need for maintenance medications in addiction treatment, there’s even more evidence that it can help reduce harm.</p> <p>For example, 2016 <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1661\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> of the Medicare population published in <i> Health Affairs</i> found that having an effective medical marijuana law in place reduced the number of prescription pain relievers prescribed per doctor by just over 1,800 daily doses per year, compared to states without such laws. Reductions were also seen in prescribing of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, leading to an estimated $165 million in savings in 2013. A follow-up <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1135\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> last year suggested Medicare could save over $1 billion if all states made medical marijuana legally available.</p> <p>Several research groups also interviewed chronic pain patients and medical marijuana users about which drugs they used medical marijuana to replace or reduce. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422566/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> surveyed nearly 3,000 pot smokers recruited at Washington dispensaries or via social media: 36 percent said they used marijuana to replace opioids; a Canadian <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189912\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> had similar findings. </p> <p>Other researchers <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5690609/\" target=\"_blank\">compared</a> chronic pain patients who either did or did not access medical marijuana in New Mexico: the medical marijuana users were 17 times more likely to stop using prescription opioids, five times more likely to reduce their daily dose of opioids, and took opioid doses that declined by nearly half over the 21 month study period; those who didn’t use medical marijuana showed a slight rise in opioid dose. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27001005?log$=activity\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> of 244 Michigan medical marijuana patients found a 64 percent decrease in opioid use following initiation of medical marijuana.</p> <p>The only <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28953315?log$=activity\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> I could find suggesting potential opioid-related harm linked to marijuana availability concluded that medical marijuana laws were associated with a rise in opioid mortality—but only if a state did not also have a prescription-drug monitoring database. Since all 50 states (Missouri had been the exception) have or will have such systems, it is not clear how relevant this kind of outlier is.</p> <p>I’ve reviewed here only how marijuana access is linked with reductions in opioid-associated damage: I do not have space to examine the studies on how it has also been linked with reductions in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/26/what-marijuana-legalization-did-to-car-accident-rates/?utm_term=.7ea5a029cf5e\" target=\"_blank\">traffic deaths</a> and those that suggest people often use marijuana <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3063288\" target=\"_blank\">instead of</a> alcohol, which is a much riskier drug in terms of violence (including sexual assaults). But they also lean in the same positive direction, as does data showing that legal recreational weed is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/11/following-marijuana-legalization-teen-drug-use-is-down-in-colorado/?utm_term=.4f4f756b5b6d\" target=\"_blank\">not associated</a> with rising teen use.</p> <p>Basically, going after marijuana during an overdose epidemic arguably amounts to one of the dumbest federal government policies in American history. Not only will cutting the pot supply (if that is even achievable—decades of the War on Drugs suggest otherwise) be likely to drive more, rather than fewer, people towards opioids, but any money spent on doing so cannot be used to fund proven life-saving treatments, like long-term methadone and buprenorphine, which can cut the overdose death rate in half.</p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/ev5avz/its-time-for-democrats-to-go-all-in-on-weed?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=paqqpb&site=vice\"></iframe></div> <p>Many experts, like Mark Kleiman, professor of public policy at the Marron Institute at New York University, suspect Sessions will not follow through with major new pot enforcement. “What's notable about the Sessions statement is what it doesn't say,” Kleiman told me. “It doesn't mention injunctions. And it doesn't mention using the Narcotic Section of the Criminal Division to prosecute some cases. Looks to me like a bluff—or mostly a bluff. Maybe they'll make a few examples.”</p> <p>While that might strike fear into investors and people who work in the marijuana business, it’s unlikely to have any long-term impact on the drug policy debate in the country. “This move represents a broken campaign promise by the president,” Tom Angell, author of the indispensable marijuana newsletter and website, <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Marijuana Moment</a>, told me. “With polls showing that marijuana legalization is way more popular than the president is, this will likely turn out to be a huge political disaster for the administration, as is shown by the crushing bipartisan blowback we're now seeing in Congress. Either way, it's not going to stop even more states from modernizing their cannabis laws.”</p> <p>Sessions’s move could, however, add at least a temporary roadblock for people seeking a promising alternative treatment for pain and opioid addiction. With <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 100</a> people dying from opioid-related overdoses every single day, this is inexcusable.</p><p><i>Follow Maia Szalavitz on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/maiasz\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

        "content": "<p>Last summer, Nike SB and <i> TransWorld SKATEboarding</i> put on a contest encouraging skaters across the country to build DIY spots in their cities. They gave 14 skate shops $500 Home Depot gift cards toward the project and told them to get creative. When Seattle’s 35th North owner Tony Croghan agreed to participate in the contest, he was excited to help promote his local skate scene. Little did he know the video his shop submitted would lead to a six-figure lawsuit from the city that could ultimately put him out of business. [Disclosure: Croghan and I are friends, and I have been a customer of 35th North for years.] <br><br>Three days before the video was due, the project Croghan had settled on fell through, leaving him squarely in the lurch. Until, that is, a group of local skaters known for building weird skate obstacles stopped by the shop. Croghan figured they could use the gift card to maybe build some benches with transition. <br></p><div data-embedded-url=\"http://players.brightcove.net/1509317113/3a88c7ac-7308-40e7-8334-1cfe33120b22_default/index.html?videoId=5514616732001\" data-iframely-id=\"ezeQprY\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/ezeQprY\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Instead, the skaters built a 15’ x 15’ bowl overnight on a tiny urban island using nothing but a canoe, tarps, and hand tools.<br><br>The skaters involved in the bowl refused to comment for this story for fear of worsening their legal troubles. But other local skaters familiar with the project say they left to build the bowl the same night they got the gift card, hauling the concrete out via canoe in the wee hours. They then retired to Beth’s, a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Dx0ht6MZT-8\" target=\"_blank\">locally famous</a> 24-hour cafe right by the lake, where they drew up the plans using crayons and the backs of coloring sheets. Later, as the Seattle workforce donned their Fitbits and did laps around the popular jogging path that girds the lake, the crew mixed concrete in tarps, pouring in lake water and swinging the tarps back and forth like hammocks to make the proper slurry. Eventually, on a little patch of dirt, they poured that mix into a mold made of wooden stakes and masonite sheets, yielding a rough but serviceable freestanding bowl, complete with a little hip.<br></p> <p>“The logistics of getting the material out there and mixing the concrete, I was very impressed,” said Micah Shapiro, lead designer for Grindline, a world-renowned skatepark construction firm based in Seattle. “Concrete’s heavy. Floating it out there, and how they mixed it using tarps, I was very impressed by that and the effort they went through to make it happen.”</p> <p>That effort did not go unnoticed, and 35th North was named one of the contest's three winners. Soon after the announcement was made online, a concerned citizen sent the video to the Seattle Parks Department, according to spokeswoman Rachel Schulkin. After viewing the video, Parks asked the police to investigate, with Schulkin <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/illicit-skatepark-on-green-lakes-duck-island-cops-called-on-bowl-built-in-bird-habitat/\" target=\"_blank\">telling the <i>Seattle Times</i> last July</a> that the damage was “significant enough” to warrant it.</p> <p>As a result of that investigation, Nike SB stripped the crew of their win. In a statement sent to <i> Seattle Times</i>, Nike wrote that they “do not condone the creation of skate spots where they are not permitted by law. TransWorld reviewed the entry, and it will be expelled as it broke the contest rules.” Neither Transworld nor Nike responded to a request for comment for this article.</p> <p>Though it might not be in line with the build-it-anywhere, skate-or-die vibe that <a href=\"https://skateboarding.transworld.net/58doityourself/\" target=\"_blank\">the contest’s promo video</a> sought to capture, there were, of course, rules, and they prohibited any entry that “infringes or violates any law or regulation.”</p> <p>On top of the disqualification, last month the City of Seattle announced a civil suit against the skate shop, as well as the 20 unidentified John and Jane Does it suspects of building the bowl. The city’s announcement said that they would seek damages “in the low six figures.”</p> <p>The charging documents allege that “35th North was involved in, authorized, funded, ratified, and/or induced the construction of the Skatepark.” Croghan said he had no idea the bowl was being built, and that neither he nor his employees participated in the actual construction, only submitting the video entry to Nike after it was complete.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/Thrashers-Jake-Phelps/55ccf73c1956df9a33a757d0\" data-iframely-id=\"GT4ZBXr\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/GT4ZBXr\"></iframe></div></div><p>“I would understand if this case was based on removal of this very small structure,” he said. “…But it’s nine counts of things. It’s aggressive. In the claim, there are weeds that they blame on this structure, that they say grew because of it.” The city claims that the defendants “cut down one or more trees and destroyed vegetation.” That’s particularly frustrating to Croghan, as he says the tree fell of its own volition <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BWs67KODPKk/\" target=\"_blank\">about a month</a> after the bowl was built. He now feels like he’s being taken to the cleaners rather than asked to pay for cleanup.</p><p> <br> <br>The City Attorney’s office declined to comment on the case, but Schulkin, the Park's spokeswoman, confirmed that the Parks Department is including more than just the cost of removing the bowl in its estimated damages, noting that the island had been in need of restoration for some time before the bowl’s construction. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/R5t9qG0ceIc?t=1m38s\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube videos</a> show makeshift homeless encampments on the island, and it is widely known as a haven for ambitious high school keggers.</p> <p>“It’s kind of a two-for,” Schulkin said. “We’re doing some additional restoration work, but we’re also doing baseline remediation work to get it back to what it was. Our Parks crews decided that we might as well engage in restoration work as well.”<br> <br> <br>The cost of simply removing the bowl came to about $7,000, she estimated, but the cost of the additional restoration work will be about $25,000. Add on legal expenses and consider the fact that the city is asking for treble damages, which they’re entitled to under <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=4.24.630\" target=\"_blank\">Washington State law</a>, and that’s how you end up at a six-figure number.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/wjgekq/jason-dills-fall-reading-list?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=kznnq3&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>However, it also represents almost guaranteed bankruptcy for the skate shop. Even a settlement for a lower amount is likely to shutter the business, Croghan said, admitting that, “If someone came in and stole $20,000 from us right now, we’d be done.”</p> <p>And he’s not exactly in a position to make up the difference himself. After 20 years of running the skate shop, he notes, he still pays himself something in the arena of $50,000 a year. (The Department of Housing and Urban Development <a href=\"http://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/What-s-low-income-in-Seattle-72-000-11102151.php\" target=\"_blank\">considers anything below $72,000</a> to be “low-income” for a single-person household in Seattle.) Instead of living on Capitol Hill, the hip urban neighborhood where the skate shop is located, he takes the bus in from faraway West Seattle, where he splits rent on a small house with his girlfriend.</p> <p>Schulkin acknowledged that the suit was seeking a hefty sum, but said that the city was taking a tough stance on damage to public land in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/09/21/24570247/view-obsessed-west-seattle-homeowners-who-illegally-cut-trees-sued-for-16m\" target=\"_blank\">recent scandal</a> involving wealthy private homeowners who cut down trees on public property to improve their views.</p> <p>“In Seattle there’s quite a culture of caring about public land,” she said. “So people kind of expect that people are held accountable for this.”</p> <p>Croghan contends that his motivation for being in the contest had everything to do with promoting the local skate scene and nothing to do with profiting off public lands.</p> <p>“I think they’re out of touch with the realities of being a small business,” he said. “Even if I was not a skate shop, there are small businesses struggling all over the place that are valuable to this community. But a skate shop, on top of being a small business, is not a business where decisions are made for profit. You make decisions to represent a community.”</p> <p>Indeed, while skate shops are nominally for-profit businesses, they often double as de facto community centers, providing a physical space for skaters to throw video premieres, hang their art, host visiting pros, and generally hang around and shoot the shit.</p> <p>Tony Vitello, president of <i> Thrasher</i> magazine and a long-time fan of 35th North, told VICE the shop has done a particularly good job of that.</p> <p>“Obviously I have a very biased opinion,” he admitted. “Not only have I been friends with Tony for a long time, but I also think his shop is one of the best skate shops around, anywhere in the world. For a number of reasons, but one of them is the sense of community that he’s built in Seattle and skateboarding.”</p> <p>That, Croghan said, is why it’s particularly galling that the city seems dead set on shutting them down.</p> <p>“I feel deeply disrespected by the city I grew up in,” he said. “I have owned a local business for almost 20 years—half my life—and was apparently not worthy of one phone call or email from the city before they filed this. I feel as if I am not looked at as a business owner and member of the business community for some reason. It’s crushing. It really is.”</p> <p>Losing the skate shop, Vitello said, would be a real loss for the city, noting that Seattle, like San Francisco, has struggled to maintain its cultural identity in the face of dizzying, tech-driven growth.</p> <p>“Both cities are really suffering from an identity crisis right now,” he said. “I don’t think fundamentally that the city actually values places like 35th North. A lot of the city’s history has become an afterthought. Not that 35th North or even a company like Thrasher are very old, but they’re very much a part of the fabric of their cities, and something that I think are of major cultural importance.”</p> <p>That’s something, he warned, that can’t be easily replaced.</p> <p>“You can build a million coffee shops in any city, but a skate shop is a pretty unique institution.”</p><p><i>Follow Thobias on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pinestbomber?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

        "content": "<p> Tim Heidecker was the greatest political satirist of 2017—a fact that’s easily overlooked when the airwaves are flooded with a <i> Daily Show</i> clone army, with every late-night host doing ten minutes on tax reform. Amongst the din, Heidecker has crafted a reflection of the American character that goes far deeper than any of John Oliver’s rants, or Seth Meyers’s earnest pleas for resistance.</p> <p> From Tom Peters of <i> Tom Goes To The Mayor </i>to his performance in 2012’s <i> The Comedy</i>, Heidecker’s charted the path of the collapsing American manhood,as well as the trappings of toxic masculinity, white identity politics, and the lame aesthetics and chronic mediocrity at its core. Heidecker’s universe of outlet-mall Willy Loman archetypes has bled into our present hellscape so seamlessly that you’d have been forgiven for mistaking most of 2016 for a sketch ripped from <i> Tim and Eric</i> <i> Awesome Show Great Job!</i> Deep within the nightmares offered by Heidecker and Abso-lutely productions lie the truest depiction of the current American dream.</p> <p> His long-running webseries with Gregg Turkington, <i> On Cinema</i>, began as a simple satire of the self proclaimed expert, but soon transformed into a multi-media, multi-platform, fan-interactive parodic collage. With his warped onscreen persona now standing trial for mass-death by toxic vapes at his DIY EDM festival, Heidecker and Turkington have added new shades to the hilariously bleak <i> On Cinema</i> metaverse. The trial’s real-time depiction of Tim’s character being confronted with his own bullshit was one of the surest riffs on the characters and ideas that brought us Trump. We talked to Heidecker about creating his universe and his hopes (or lack thereof) for the future.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWotb3gci0A\" data-iframely-id=\"LFVUult\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/LFVUult?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p> <b> VICE: </b><b> <i> On Cinema</i></b><b> began as a podcast, but since then it’s become much more. Was that planned?</b><br> <b> Tim Heidecker: </b>No way—it started as you heard it. At the time, there was a preponderance of comedians doing podcasts—a lot of people more interested in hearing the sound of their own voice than anything else [<i> Laughs</i>]. Anything you get to do on your own and without any kind of pressure or big budget, you develop in the lab a little bit. We enjoyed naturally developing these two characters, and on the podcast I was already starting to develop my politics and bully-ish behavior.</p> <p> <b> The trial encapsulated six years of jokes and story arcs. How’d you arrive at the initial idea?</b><br> We thought this was a good opportunity to let the audience literally put this guy on trial and litigate all these decisions he’s made over the years, in a different context other than the show—where he has all the authority and the dissent is just Greg. We thought it’d be interesting to see how his actions would be perceived by “normal” people—lawyers, judges. We were optimistic that it would work, but it worked better than we could have ever imagined [<i> Laughs</i>].</p> <p> <b> Taking a deluded figure and making him accountable for his words and actions is very Trump-esque. Was the trial a response to what’s happening with the administration?</b><br> We absorb so much of the world and we talk about it all the time that it subconsciously affects our work. There’s certainly a lot of tics and phraseology that I take from Trump—it dovetails with the way the character behaves, and we use it as inspiration. With the trial, where this character’s giving speeches, that’s where Trump comes in most. You’re stuck in this room with this guy, and there’s this sense that he doesn’t really know what he’s talking about. He hasn’t really thought through what he’s going to say, and that’s something I think we see him do all the time.</p> <p> A lot of people have said that the trial was, in a weird way, like therapy for this year—this alternate universe we can laugh at. It’s not real, but it feels connected to the world we live in. When Greg and I are going at it on Twitter, we’re getting into these really inane and pointless arguments, and people say it’s such a relief to see that when the real world is full of such dark, real terror.</p> <p> <b> Your character is a villain. Who’s worse—him or Trump?</b><br> Trump by a thousand years, because he has the capacity to do real damage and is doing it to real people. This character of mine has done a lot of damage too, but he’s ultimately a failure. The back-and-forth we go through is who’s worse: Tim or Gregg. Tim is obviously the bad guy, but it’s hard to argue that Gregg is the good guy, because every time you want to get behind him he also does something that makes him kind of unlikable. He’s hard to root for. </p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"> <iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/pae7vg/being-unlikeable-comes-naturally-to-tim-heidecker?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=8xvv7k&site=vice\"></iframe> </div> <p> <b> The idea of failure is a recurring theme in your work, from Tom Peters to Tim from </b><b> <i> On Cinema</i></b><b> . It feels as if men like these have hijacked the American discourse. What’s next for them?</b><br> I don’t know what’s next, but I’m very attuned to it and maybe have a sympathetic ear for it. Take your average middle-aged white guy—he doesn’t have to be white—and the concepts of career and family are very different from 30 years ago. A lot of the myths about being a man have been eroded or adapted, and I see comedy in that. </p> <p> I had a neighbor a few years ago who was telling me about this opportunity he was interested in: selling automated sign holders—mannequins that hold signs in front of car dealerships. You got this whiff of failure from the whole thing: a guy who should be five or ten years away from retiring is hustling around the car dealerships selling this garbage product [<i> Laughs</i>]. There’s sadness there, but there’s also a lot of comedy too.</p> <p> It’s fertile comedic ground to have a character who’s constantly trying to find success through business—a sucker, like Willy Loman I grew up in a family of car salespeople, and that’s the grim reality of those spaces. It’s about getting older and seeing the consequences from the choices you made in the past—realizing that you can’t control your future and your destiny.</p> <p> <b> Your On Cinema reflects the toxic masculinity seen from the alt-right. Is the real world becoming harder to outpace?</b><br> We’re at a place in the show’s universe where we’re talking about which direction we’re going in, and my gut tells me the Richard Spencer and Pepe stuff is so topical that we won’t go in that direction. There’s plenty of people exploring that, and we were a little ahead of that, so we don’t need to directly go down that path.</p> <p> <b> Is it weird seeing the real world catch up to this character you created?</b><br> I’ve been telling a standup joke since 2011 about how great it would be if Donald Trump became president [<i> Laughs</i>]. But I’m not this troll online who’s into anime—that’s a younger person I don’t know how to approach. But I do know the guy who’s 40, a white straight male, has been the king of the hill forever, and thinks that every little stupid thought he has is gospel. I can tap into what’s funny about that guy.</p> <p> In season eight of <i> On Cinema</i> I decided I would endorse Trump and reflect the way we felt about your average Trump supporter: a dim-witted person who can’t put sentences together. When I wrote the endorsement letter, it was a poorly-written mess that was reflective of not only his supporters but himself. Much of the way he communicates is like he’s having mini-strokes in his brain. We’re not interested in being polite or kind about the way we depict these people.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/the-worlds-greatest-donald-trump-impersonator-john-didomenico/590cdc6778d27c8727875021\" data-iframely-id=\"j3CuNcD\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/j3CuNcD\"></iframe></div></div> <p> <b> Its seems every network comedy and late-night show is political now. Do you feel like they are destined to fall short when it comes to dealing with Trump?</b><br> No one’s ever going to land anything on anybody that’ll take them down—to, as clickbait would say, “eviscerate.” That stuff is providing a little comfort in knowing that they’re not crazy, and a lot of those guys do a good job of it. I’m not a big fan of “the guy in the suit sitting behind the desk kind of tearing the news apart every night”—that feels very stale to me.</p> <p> We do stuff like that gets branded as “anti-comedy,” but we view comedy as just another thing to make fun of—the way comedy is presented, homogenized, and used. A lot of <i> On Cinema</i> and certainly <i> Decker</i> is overtly political in how they take in current events and spit them back out. We’re trying to do a more subtle, clever version of what, say, John Oliver is doing.</p> <p> <b> Decker feels like the only political satire that links the Bush era to Trump. Why aren’t more comics doing that?</b><br> I don’t pay attention to too much of what’s going on out there. There’s nothing else like what we do [<i> Laughs</i>]—that’s probably a good thing, but I don’t know. Anthony Atamanuik’s <i> The President’s Show</i> is great—he does a really great, smart version of Trump. Television moves so slow. Getting anything made takes a long time. That’s why those <i> Daily Show</i> formats work, because you can just pump them out on a daily basis. I think people in the corporate side are very scared and nervous about what’s coming.</p> <p> <b> Do you feel like guys like Vic Berger fill that vacuum?</b><br> There’s great shit happening on the internet. It’s not presented as TV, although we’re always trying to change that. Some of the best satire—some of the best comedy <i> period</i>—has been the videos Vic’s put out. I put that next to all the other stuff I can watch on TV. Am I gonna sit and watch some network sitcom for 20 minutes, or am I gonna watch 20 minutes of Vic’s videos? It’s obvious what I’m gonna watch.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"> <iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/kwx9qm/vic-berger-iv-is-vines-strangest-political-satirist?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=8xvv7k&site=vice\"></iframe> </div> <p> <b> My friends and I were watching the election last year and thinking, “This looks like a Tim and Eric sketch.” Do you feel as though he’s stolen your shtick?</b><br> I think what’s funny is he’s surrounded by less talented people than should be [<i> Laughs</i>]. I love Dan Scavino, his media guy. He puts out these videos and they’re edited on his iPhone—terrible graphics, sound’s all fucked up. They’re hilarious to us! </p> <p> <b> How important is that look to your work?</b><br> For Eric and I, it’s always ideas-based. With On Cinema, too, style comes secondary to what the idea is. What’s the best format for the idea and how can we can convey the humor? The trial has to look exactly like a trial—any flaws in the representation will sink it. A lot of our earlier work that had this crazy lo-fi stuff, but since then we always try to say that’s not necessarily what we’re about. We’re about communicating ideas and the best way to do that.</p> <p> It seems like everybody has now gotten a news desk with the TV streaming behind them or something [<i> Laughs</i>]. That seems like a funny way to go about leading the show in this direction that’s further away from what Greg wants it to be [<i> Laughs</i>].</p> <p> <b> Last year, you released </b><b> <i> Too Dumb For Suicide</i></b><b> , which seemed to offer some safe space from the news.</b><br> This has been a gripe I’ve had for a little while now: we’re at a place where the term “safe space” has become pejorative. It’s really telling. I know the problem that they have with that concept is that it disrupts free speech, but a safe space is ultimately a good thing [<i> Laughs</i>]. This thing of, “You’re just a pussy, you’re a cuck, you need your safe space”—no! I fucking love a safe space! I want a safe space as much as possible! [<i> Laughs</i>] It’s crazy that that’s become a negative concept.</p> <p> <b> What do you think the future holds? Do you have any hope?</b><br>No hope. No hope. [<i> Laughs</i>]. There’s no guarantees that this is gonna all work out. We could be entering a very dark period, where a lot of basic functions that we’re used to aren’t there anymore. Or, things just continue to dribble on. I think my hopefulness is probably lower right now than it would normally be. It doesn’t seem like it’s going in the right direction [<i> Laughs</i>]. It’ll be interesting. We’re living in historic times, as my friend said. At least you’ll have something to tell your grandkids: “I was around in 2017 and believe me, I can tell you”. Sorry, I wish I had better news for you! [<i>Laughs</i>]</p> <p><i>Follow Patrick Marlborough on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cormac_mccafe?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

        "content": "<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision last week to <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d34xza/the-stoners-guide-to-trumps-new-weed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">allow federal prosecutors to go after marijuana businesses</a> in places where pot is legal under state law might have alarmed some observers, but it was hardly surprising. Sessions is an old-school drug warrior who is <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evaaze/watch-jeff-sessions-tell-interns-that-weed-is-as-dangerous-as-guns\" target=\"_blank\">fairly open about his hatred of weed</a>, so it’s natural that he rescinded the Cole Memo, the Obama-era guidance that told the feds to lay off cannabis merchants in states like Colorado and Washington except in extreme circumstances.</p> <p>It’s a move that Neal Levine, for one, has been anticipating. Based in Denver, he’s been campaigning for marijuana liberalization since the early days of the George W. Bush administration. But where Levine differs from many marijuana advocates is that he identifies as a libertarian, specifically the type of libertarian who calls taxation “confiscation.” His first political gig was working for the maverick wrestler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura. After nearly 20 years of activism (both paid and unpaid) he now lobbies in Colorado and Washington, DC, for Livwell Enlightened Health, one of Colorado’s biggest weed retailers. </p> <p>Despite the GOP’s historic aversion to marijuana, Levine regards legalization as a natural cause for conservatives, so much so that after the election of Donald Trump he teamed with industry grandees to establish the <a href=\"https://www.newfederalismfund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">New Federalism Fund</a>, a organization aiming to win the administration over to supporting legalization. </p> <p>“The social justice component of the marijuana argument—all of which is completely legitimate— has been prominent for some time,” he told me over the phone from Livwell’s headquarters shortly after Sessions’s announcement. “By contrast, the New Federalism Fund was set up to talk <i> to </i>the right, <i> from </i>the right, using the language of the right.” </p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/will-california-weed-growers-survive-legal-marijuana/5a4bd3a8177dd464ca67cceb\" data-iframely-id=\"5l50VAl\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/5l50VAl\"></iframe></div></div> <hr><p>The NFF wants to win over the right by appealing to one of its most deeply held philosophical principles: that states should be free to set their own destinies with limited interference from the federal government. </p> <p>But while states’ rights has long been a popular rallying call for conservatives, it’s become apparent in the Trump era that not everyone on the right believes that states should really have all that much leeway, with the administration trying to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb37bx/even-in-a-sanctuary-state-immigrants-are-still-in-danger\" target=\"_blank\">crack down on “sanctuary cities”</a> that don’t assist the feds' efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. But that hasn’t stopped Levine from appealing to legislators in an effort to get them to leave states alone when it comes to marijuana.</p> <p>“Our view is that states should be the laboratories of democracy,” Levine said. “The authors of the Constitution intended that states should be free to pursue their own social and policy changes, when the impact is limited within their own political territory.</p> <p>“Federalism is always challenged on the difficult things; not those easy issues where there is broad consensus,” he said. “Marijuana represents the ideal opportunity for the administration to reaffirm its commitment to the principle that states should have the power to decide.”</p> <p>But the NFF’s argument goes beyond constitutional theory: Convinced it can build traction with the White House, the NFF has deployed Trumpian language in its promo materials, calling on the administration to promote “American prosperity” and back “American job creators.” </p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/43qnpn/even-republicans-hate-jeff-sessionss-new-weed-policy?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=3k55yy&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>On Capitol Hill, the NFF has called on conservative lawmakers to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2017/11/29/gop-senator-wants-tax-break-for-marijuana-businesses/&amp;refURL=https:/www.google.co.uk/&amp;referrer=https:/www.google.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">strip away a bit of IRS code</a> that leaves legitimate marijuana businesses paying eye-watering amounts in taxes. Known as 280E, this line of tax code was created in the early 80s in response to an audacious attempt by drug cartels to profit from corporate tax rules. Today, 280E prevents any company from deducting business expenses connected to federally prohibited substances like marijuana. The end result is that many marijuana businesses are paying tax rates north of 70 percent. </p> <p>“We aren’t asking for special favors,” Levine said. “Marijuana businesses just want to be treated like everyone else. People assume we’re swimming in money. What they don’t realize is that if you’re in the cannabis business the government is helping itself to pretty much everything that you’re taking.”</p> <p>Last year, 15 House Republicans <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1810/cosponsors?q=%7B%22party%22%3A%22Republican%22%7Dhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1810/cosponsors?q=%7B%22party%22%3A%22Republican%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">pledged their support for a new initiative to deliver “tax parity”</a> by overruling the hated 280E (that’s three times the number of Republicans who supported a similar bill in 2015). And there are other signs of conservatives willing to rethink their traditional opposition. Last week, several prominent Republicans—largely those representing weed-friendly states—publicly criticized Sessions’s anti-weed move, among them Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner, who opposed legalization in his state but is now <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/05/politics/cory-gardner-marijuana-laws/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">leading the charge</a> against the Justice Department’s perceived overreach. </p> <p>Although these moves might make headlines, the fact remains that the vast majority of Republicans oppose the liberalization of weed. The Rohrabacher–Farr Amendment—a bipartisan measure intended to stop federal agencies interfering with states’ medical marijuana programs—has been <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll258.xml\" target=\"_blank\">consistently opposed</a> by the majority of House Republicans. Likewise, <a href=\"http://norml.org/congressional-scorecard/us-senators\" target=\"_blank\">voting data</a> from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) shows that Senate Republicans typically take a much tougher stance on marijuana than their Democrat counterparts. </p> <p>Among rank-and-file party members, the picture is slightly more nuanced. Although still significantly more skeptical than Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/559989879/all-time-high-majority-of-republicans-support-pot-legalization-for-first-time\" target=\"_blank\">polling data</a> has shown growing support from Republican voters for marijuana liberalization (with some polls even showing narrow majority support), particularly among younger voters. </p> <p>One of those younger voters is John Baucum. Based in deep-red Texas, he serves as political director of <a href=\"http://www.rampgop.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition</a>. In 2015, he <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/03/ted-cruz-texas-republicans-against-marijuana-prohibition/\" target=\"_blank\">pressed Ted Cruz</a> on his marijuana position, calling on the Texas senator to reiterate his support for states’ rights.</p> <p>Having walked in Republican and marijuana circles, Baucum knows more than most how rarely the two positions go together. Nevertheless, he insists that things are slowly changing.</p> <p>“It used to be that if you were looking to move up professionally within the GOP —or perhaps even stand as a candidate yourself—you had to stay away from controversial topics like marijuana reform,” Baucum told me from Houston. “The emergence of libertarian figures like Rand Paul – and the more populist approach taken by Trump—has made it easier for people who support less state interference with marijuana usage.&quot;</p> <p>“Texas is a conservative state,” he went on. “But over three-quarters of young Republican activists told us they supported some degree of marijuana reform. That might not mean full legalization—it could mean decriminalization or the use of civil penalties—but it shows the progress we are making the case with conservatives.”</p> <p>Sessions’s move doesn’t mean there will be a wave of arrests targeting legal pot dealers, but sellers are nervous. Many fear that mixed signals from Washington may lead to nervousness among banks (who have only recently opened up their services to marijuana merchants), taking the industry back to the <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/03/22/why-marijuana-businesses-still-cant-get-bank-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">dark era of cash-only payments</a>. </p> <p>In Colorado, most of the big distributors remember the days of having to pay staff and suppliers in brown envelopes, not to mention having to find safe storage for the thousands in cash crossing their counters each day. That isn’t just a major business inconvenience: Having that much cash in transit is a huge public safety issue. </p> <p>“The New Federalism Fund is happy to keep talking to one member of congress at a time, until they realize this industry is here to stay,” said Levine. “We will keep telling our story to the federal government and make clear that any clampdown could undermine public safety and damage the economies of multiple states.”</p> <p>For cannabis campaigners from both the right and left, the ultimate goal of federally legal weed may seem especially distant right now. But if anti-cannabis laws finally do fall, it’ll likely be because at least some Republicans favor legalization. If nothing else, multibillion-dollar industries have a knack for getting their way.</p><p><i> Robert Jackman is a writer interested in personal freedoms—however strange or provocative—in today's America.</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><i>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://vice.com/da\" target=\"_blank\">VICE Denmark</a>.</i></p><p>Rachid Moutiq is 29 years old, has a BA in journalism, and lives with bipolar disorder. About <a href=\"http://www.psykiatrifonden.dk/viden/diagnoser/depression/bipolar-lidelse/bipolar-lidelse.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">40,000 Danes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/statistics\" target=\"_blank\">4 million Brits</a> have had the same or a similar diagnosis, but as is often the case with mental illness, <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/news/38-brits-fear-revealing-mental-health-problem-work-would-jeopardise-their-career\" target=\"_blank\">there's still a lot of stigma around it</a>.</p><p>Moutiq and I went to high school together, where he did exceptionally well. I always considered him a genius; he was one of the smartest and most promising people I knew. But life, so far, hasn't turned out for him the way we all expected; being bipolar has made it difficult for Moutiqto hold down a traditional job. </p><p>Recently, he moved from Copenhagen back to the countryside to be closer to his family. I spoke to Moutiq to hear how the disorder has affected every aspect of his life. <br></p> <p><b> VICE: What was it like to get your diagnosis?</b><br> <b> Rachid Moutiq:</b> I got it about a year ago, and it was such a relief, at first. I'd been misdiagnosed so often over the years, so it felt great to finally know what was going on with me. But that feeling subsided when I realized how serious the diagnosis is. When you're bipolar, you feel like there is a pendulum swinging between being extremely self-critical and awkward, and suddenly having an immense amount of confidence. I convinced myself that I always had to feel great, confident, and energetic, and it was tough to face the fact that my mania is as harmful as the depression. In order to be healthy, I have to find balance, but that balanced state doesn't come naturally to me, and the thought of it bores me a bit.</p> <p><b> What's it like to be manic?<br></b>Early on in my manic states, I am the best version of myself. I do everything faster and don't get tired or sad. I'm not able to sleep, but I also don't feel the need to. It's like living in an upbeat movie montage: You don’t have to think—you just <i> do</i>, and everything is awesome. You talk a lot and have a hard time waiting for people to answer. You're superhuman, you're hilarious, you're the center of attention and loving it. If someone isn't giving you their undivided attention, you don't take it personally—you just think they're missing out. I guess that, in many ways, it's like being on cocaine. </p> <div> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg?resize=1030:*\" media=\"(min-width: 53.125em)\"> <img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981249716-Me3.jpeg\"> </picture> <div>Photo by Roseann Sabla</div> </div> <p><b>Why is the mania as bad as depression, then?</b><br> There are two main reasons. The first one is that if you're manic long enough, eventually the same thing happens as when you're doing coke for a few days straight—you become paranoid, and out of control. After a manic episode, my brain just snaps and the depression hits. Secondly, you do things that are out of character when you’re manic. You make important decisions about your life, money, and relationships in a split second, and that can ruin your life.</p><p>I once gambled away $2,400 and the bank closed my account. Hyper-sexuality is also a symptom—I've had manic sex in public spaces with people whose names I didn't even know. It can ruin your relationships, your friendships, and your career. It’s not uncommon for people to quit their jobs when they're manic because they don't want to be tied down, only to deeply regret it when the episode is over. </p><p><b>How does being bipolar affect your day-to-day? <br></b>This diagnosis affects everything. I often can't sleep—I was awake for two-and-a-half days once, and when I finally fell asleep, I slept for 20 hours straight. You lose control of your body. When I’m manic, I have to remind myself to eat—and when I do eat, I have to remind myself to stop. </p><p>When I'm depressed, I interpret everything completely differently. Simply getting up in the morning and going to work is a challenge. Your reflexes aren't great, so you can hardly drive a car. I have experienced depression so severe that I was struggling to even slice a loaf of bread. I had so little energy that it seemed impossible to hold the bread and slice it with the knife. When you feel like that, you don't have the energy to shower—you don't even think you deserve to be clean. </p><hr><p><b><i>WATCH: 10 Questions You Always Wanted to Ask an Undercover Drugs Cop</i></b></p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_uk/video/10-questions-you-always-wanted-to-ask-an-undercover-drugs-cop/5a37a762177dd40ba763dd03\" data-iframely-id=\"WCYM4Xy\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/WCYM4Xy\"></iframe></div></div> <hr><p><b> How does being bipolar affect your relationship with other people?</b> <br> It's difficult to be close to people because you can't give what you are expected to in social exchanges. When I’m depressed, I feel people are wasting their love on me—simply meeting someone you know on the street and saying hi can be very hard. And that's if you even manage to go outside. When you're depressed it doesn’t matter how much your friend wants you to come to a party; you're not able to leave the house regardless of how hard you try. You are dealing with very low energy and very high anxiety.</p> <p><b>What's dating like? </b><br>When you're manic or depressed, a partner can easily take your mental state personally, by feeling like they've done something wrong. The inconsistency of your mood can make them nervous around you. People have told me, &quot;I never know what to expect from you,&quot; which makes sense—I also don't know what to expect from me. It's understandable that your loved ones get frustrated, angry, and sad when you start shielding yourself from the outside world, but it also means that you become more isolated, which makes you feel worse. </p> <p><b> In what way has the illness affected your career?<br></b>I have no on/off switch, so I can’t regulate how much energy I use. A lot of people with bipolar disorder are extremely creative and skilled, but they can only work in a constant creative stream that doesn't end at 6 PM—and if you don't manage your workflow, you'll burn out. A traditional workplace expects you to be consistent, to get up at the same time every day, and to handle the same amount of work. I don't think people are meant to do that every day—you don't need a mental disorder to feel that way—but it feels more trying with bipolar disorder. I'll never be able to attend work that regularly or always have the same productivity, but I can see myself in a proper job in the future—though it'll be difficult.</p> <div> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981372697-Me-2.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981372697-Me-2.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981372697-Me-2.jpeg?resize=640:*\" media=\"(min-width: 25em)\"> <img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1509981372697-Me-2.jpeg\"> </picture> <div>Rachid and a colleague on location in the Philippines during the filming of a documentary in 2014. Photo: Gabriel Lorenzo Pagcaliwagan</div> </div> <p><b>Are you worried that your children might have bipolar disorder? </b><br>Oh yeah, absolutely. It can be hereditary, so I'm giving a lot of thought to whether I should bring children into this world. I've felt life wasn't worth living so many times. Being born is not a choice you make yourself, so I'm always wondering whether I can justify giving life to a person who may someday resent their existence, just as I have. </p> <p><b> What are the worst prejudices you deal with?</b><br> People tend to be quite understanding in general. But the worst is when you're told that you can just snap out of depression as if it's just a matter of pulling yourself together. I think every depressed person has internalized that idea in some way. Despite having lived with this for years, I still sometimes wonder if my depression is just a case of me being lazy. </p><p>There's a lot of that sentiment in the media, too—you hear &quot;experts&quot; explain how they were depressed, but then started working out and read some motivational quotes and then it all worked out. If that's what solved it, they didn't actually suffer from depression. Another specific prejudice about people with bipolar disorder is that they can't be trusted—that they're manipulative liars. When you're bipolar, you're definitely not completely reliable, but that’s not the same thing.</p> <p><b>Can you be cured of bipolar disorder? </b><br> It's a chronic illness, so that won't happen. It's one of the most important lessons I have to learn—it never stops; it won't go away. If you think you're over it and start ignoring the signs, you run the risk of falling into a deep depression or severe mania. I'm still haunted by the idea of life being unbearable, but I’m getting better. I’m optimistic, but the most brutal aspect of being bipolar is the fact that you can be on the right path, but one single slipup can catapult you back to square one. It's like drug or alcohol abuse, in that regard.</p>",

What better way to relieve the misery and pain than by reconnecting with the one who broke your heart? </p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0743558412464524\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> showed that nearly 50 percent of young adults have attempted at least one reconciliation with an ex. While it can be a recipe for disaster if done hastily or for the wrong reasons, getting back together isn’t always an <i> Emoji Movie</i>-level terrible idea. If both people have spent time working through their issues, a reconciliation might even make sense. But it’s a big decision that should be met with careful consideration. </p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/wjz8bx/how-to-stop-self-sabotaging?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=j5vvxx&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>Before you rush into your ex’s arms (or inbox), it’s essential to have a strategy. We asked dating coaches, relationship experts, and therapists about what to keep in mind when getting back together with a former flame. Taken together, the experts’ advice offers a useful roadmap for anyone who’s interested in giving their boo another go. Answers have been edited for length and clarity. </p> <h2> Time <i>Is</i> On Your Side</h2> <p>You know you’re ready when you've had enough time away from your ex to work through what went wrong in the relationship. This is months or years, not days or weeks. Another time to consider it is when you see signs of positive change in yourself and in your partner, change that pertains to whatever split you up in the first place. For example, if you split up because one partner didn't want to get married and the other did, one partner has to have changed their view on that, or a rekindling won't work. Learn from the past. If you think the passage of time or &quot;some time apart&quot; is enough to solve the problems, you'll probably wind up broken up again. If you want to know that your partner has changed, actions speak louder than words. If he or she has changed, you'll see it in their behavior and actions. – <a href=\"http://christiehartman.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Christie Hartman</i></b></a><b><i> , Dating and relationship expert </i></b></p> <h2> Want Success? Look for Signs of Change </h2> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/ne3qww/how-to-stop-checking-your-exs-social-media?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=j5vvxx&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>Although there are a myriad of reasons that cause a relationship to break, being confidant that those circumstances have changed is key to future success. Internal changes such as self-awareness, breaking old patterns, renewed vulnerability and trust, and healing from the past sets us up for a new experience with a familiar person. Also, external changes such as career, effective communication, and overall timing support a successful second chance. Getting back together with an ex partner can be likened to repairing an emotional injury. A successful relationship is not disqualified because it did not work initially, success comes in how you repair it. Repair it well! – <i><a href=\"https://www.akuakboateng.com/blog-1\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Akua Boateng</b></a><b> , M.S., LPC, Licensed Psychotherapist</b> </i> </p> <h2> Brutal Honesty is Key</h2> <p>Think long and hard before you try to get back together with an ex. You really need to be brutally honest with yourself about why you’re trying to get back with them. Is it just a case of golden-aging your previous relationship? Why did you break up with them in the first place? Have you actually healed from things or are you still holding onto the hurts and grievances? If you get angry, are you going to throw their past sins back in their face? Are you absolutely sure you’re ready for a relationship with the person who they are now, rather than who they used to be? If the two of you can’t talk about what happened and each own your part of the break-up––as well as forgive one another and yourselves––then all you’re doing is guaranteeing you’re going to have a rerun of the old conflicts. - <a href=\"http://www.doctornerdlove.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Harris O'Malley aka Dr. NerdLove</i></b></a><b><i> , Dating Expert</i></b></p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/big-sean-on-exes-kanye-and-nipples/57c696763b9a31982c8b0903\" data-iframely-id=\"WmZvUA1\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/WmZvUA1\"></iframe></div></div> <h2> Making a New (Old) Relationship Work</h2> <p>For any great relationship, you need a combination of things: honesty, empathy, compassion, loyalty. But if you are starting over with a past love, you'll need all that plus a few critical things, which all relationships need: open, honest communication, a willingness to be wrong, discussing and releasing the past, and surrendering control. You can get back together with love, listening, acceptance, and empathy as your guides. Just keep your eyes open so you can avoid past situations and mistakes. – <a href=\"http://facebook.com/charlesjorlando\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Charles J. Orlando</i></b></a><b><i> , relationship expert and co-host of “Seven Year Switch” on Lifetime</i></b></p> <h2> Slow Your Roll on Social Media</h2> <p>If you’re thinking about getting back with your ex, take it slow. Enjoy creating new memories and respect the different perspectives you might have. Don’t rush into changing your relationship status to “in a relationship” or start posting pics all over social media until you both know for sure and you think it will stick. No one really wants to know “it’s complicated.&quot; It’s easy to recycle an ex at the holidays or after a fresh breakup. But before you start to follow, friend, and obsess about your ex and your new bright future together on social media, take it one step at a time. – <a href=\"https://cyberdatingexpert.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Julie Spira</i></b></a><b><i> , Online Dating Expert and Dating Coach</i></b></p><p><i>Follow Anna Goldfarb on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnaGoldfarb\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. </i></p>",

        "content": "<p>I wanted to talk to Japanese inventor <a href=\"http://watchesbysjx.com/2016/09/five-must-know-g-shock-facts-from-its-inventor-kikuo-ibe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kikuo Ibe</a> about time and regret. This is because 65-year-old's most enduring creation represents a deep understanding of the immutability of mistakes. If you take a look at the oft-told origin story of Ibe’s indestructible <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/worlds-rarest-g-shock-kikuo-ibe\" target=\"_blank\">G-Shock</a> watch, his horological innovations spring from a realization that you can’t go back in time to fix what you’ve broken. Instead, your only option is to build something stronger and better than what came before. </p> <p>The G-Shock was born out of an unfortunate accident. In 1982, the notoriously clumsy engineer collided into another pedestrian on the street, causing a watch his father had given him in high school to pop off his wrist. The watch cracked on the pavement, its hands dislodged and its caseback severed. The damage was irreversible and the watch was ruined. But the calamity imbued Ibe with his life’s singular obsession—to create a timepiece that could survive severe punishment.</p> <p>The mark of success for Ibe was achieving the “triple ten,” which meant the watch would continue to work after suffering a ten-meter fall, have a ten-year battery life, and boast ten-bar (100 meter) water resistance. Leading an eight-person team at Casio, the Japanese consumer electronics company, Ibe built and destroyed more than 200 prototypes chasing this dream. He threw them out of windows and ran them over with cars. But the<i> aha</i> moment for the watch came to the inventor while he was sitting alone in a park, watching a little girl bounce a rubber ball up and down on the concrete. He noticed that due to the movement of air inside the ball, the outside suffered more shock than the center. To reach the triple ten, Ibe realized his watch needed a similar design—a resilient outer structure that would allow for internal movement.</p> <p>The inaugural G-Shock, the DW-5000, was released in 1983 when he was 30 years old. Every element, from the bezel to the buttons, were designed to absorb and displace shock. It also featured a hollow case with a timekeeping module suspended in gel to recreate the bouncing-ball effect. It had a 200-meter water resistance and could easily survive a ten-meter fall. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1514744423762-2017-VICE-KikuoIbe-GIF-5-720px.gif\" data-iframely-id=\"zr7v4HT\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/zr7v4HT\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>Since that first wristwatch, the G-Shock has become an institution, spawning numerous variations that are revered by horologists, hardworking people, and hypebeasts alike. There are diver G-Shocks, analogue G-Shocks, smart G-Shocks, streetwear G-Shocks made with brands like Bape and Stussy, and high fashion G-Shocks made with vaunted labels like Maison Margiela and Robert Geller. </p> <p>But as successful as the G-Shock has become, Mr. Kikuo Ibe is still a man tempered by contrition. When I spoke to him at a big 35th anniversary bash for the watch in November in New York City, the inventor talked about the perils of wasting time. For him, that was related to the hours he spent working on his iconic watch, instead of focusing more on his family. Just like his shattered watch, that lost time is something that cannot be restored. Of course, it’s never too late to make a change for the better. That is the promise of the future, and it’s something Ibe helped me recognize throughout our conversation. Here's what the inventor had to say.</p><p><i>This interview was edited and condensed for clarity. Kikuo Ibe's words were translated by Hiroshi Fujimoto, General Manager of Planning at Casio's Timepiece Division</i><i>.</i></p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1514744498405-2017-VICE-KikuoIbe-GIF-2-1500px.gif\" data-iframely-id=\"SFyqMJO\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/SFyqMJO\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p><b> VICE: What’s the first time you remember the passage of time?</b><br> <b> Kikuo Ibe:</b> The very first moment when I was aware of time is probably when I was in junior high school taking an exam. I did poorly. I remember wanting to go back in time and study harder. It’s more like a negative memory, but it made me particularly aware of time. I yearned to go back in time and do more.</p> <p><b> As you’ve gotten older, has your concept of time changed at all?</b><br> As I have gotten older, I've become aware that time is something that is given equally. It’s a question of how you spend your time. But having said that, I think I spend my time poorly. I’m not good at spending time well. I always have regrets.</p> <p><b> Can you tell me a regret you have in terms of time you felt you’ve wasted?</b><br> I have had many occasions where I hurried even though I didn’t need to hurry. I also tend to drop things at home and break things easily. So after I break things, I have regrets about the way I rush through things. I have those regrets quite often.</p> <p><b> Is there any one thing that was broken that you wish you could have back?</b><br> There was a wine glass. It was a very important for me, but I dropped it and I broke it. I wish I could buy another one. But the glass I broke was one-of-a-kind. I can’t buy it again. That’s one thing I really regret breaking. And when I break something so important like that, I always wish I could go back in time.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1514745850187-2017-VICE-KikuoIbe-GIF-3-720px.gif\" data-iframely-id=\"jgeVPs2\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/jgeVPs2\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p><b> Do you think that as an inventor, making stuff allows you to beat time because your creations live on even after you pass away?</b><br> Well, you can't beat time. Also, all of the things we make will be forgotten eventually. But that’s OK. Time always surpasses you. In Japan, we have a common saying, “Time solves everything.” This is true, because time is superior to everything else.</p> <p><b> What do you think watches offer us?</b><br> Well, if I say it in a cool way, I think that time represents emotion in a particular moment. When you feel irritated, sad, or happy, or pleased, it’s something that you remember with five senses, but it’s always connected to a particular time. And watches help us tell that time. </p> <p><b> Is there a different sense of time between say Japan and the United States or any other places you’ve travelled? Do you feel different countries or different communities have different rhythms and run on different times?<br></b>Yes. I do feel that the perception of time differs from one place to another. Some places are very strict about time, very punctual. And some other places are more relaxed and spend time more gingerly and relaxed. Japanese people tend to be very strict and punctual about time. It's positive and negative. When I travel to other countries, I can see the difference. One time I went to a Latin American country and I had an appointment for an interview. The appointment was at 10 AM in the hotel lobby. So I went there on time and and I waited. The interviewer arrived more than two hours late like it was no big deal. He just walked up and said, &quot;Let’s start the interview.&quot; The experience made me think a lot about how time can be perceived differently in different cultures. </p> <p><b> How much time does it take to create a groundbreaking idea like the G-Shock?<br></b>That depends on who you are. After I developed the G-Shock, I tried to come up with one more groundbreaking idea. But for the last 35 years or so, I haven’t been able to find another one. It’s been really long for me, but I think for some people it’s easy. They might come up with one great idea after another. For others, that would be almost impossible. Some folks might spend their lifetime looking for a groundbreaking idea and not succeed. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1514746037959-2017-VICE-KikuoIbe-GIF-1-720px.gif\" data-iframely-id=\"VDvyAid\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/VDvyAid\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p><b>What is it like to be a father and how has that changed your perception of time?<br></b>Well, this is something that I look back on and regret. When my son was a small child, I was working really hard, therefore I didn’t spend much time with him. I was not a good father. I thought I would spend more time with him when he grew up. However, when he grew up and was older, he became very independent. I didn’t have the opportunity to spend as much time as I wanted with him.</p> <p><b>Do you think your son looks at time in a different way than you do?<br></b>I’m kind of a restless person, but I think that my son is the opposite of me. I’m a good example for him of what not to do. He takes his time and he values his time. He’s much more relaxed than I am. </p> <p><b> Did you give your son a G-Shock watch in the same way that your father gave you a watch? <br></b>I am not particular about objects in general. I remember giving my son a G-Shock, but I don't think he has ever used it. [ <i>Laughs</i>]</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1514748186500-2017-VICE-KikuoIbe-GIF-7-1080px.gif\" data-iframely-id=\"q0gdGy6\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/q0gdGy6\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p><b>Do you think that things are moving at a faster pace today than when they were when you first created the G-Shock?<br></b>I’m certainly more restless today. I spend time very hastily—in a very haste manner. A part of it is the fact there’s too much information today. I think I’m swayed by all the information, that’s why I feel busier than before.</p> <p><b>Your father’s broken gift is such a big part of the genesis of G-Shock. Is he still living today?<br></b>No. He passed away... In terms of the watch that he gave me, as I said earlier, I think all objects are forgotten. When I was faced with his death, I felt time had stopped. I didn’t feel anything special about the watch he gave me. It was useless. </p> <p><b>As you get older, do you think about </b><b>your own death and the possibility that your time is running out? <br></b>Yes. I do. I think about how I will feel when that moment comes. But I haven't experienced death yet, so it's still a bit of a mystery to me. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1514748504686-2017-VICE-KikuoIbe-GIF-8-1080px.gif\" data-iframely-id=\"NfYQAx4\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/NfYQAx4\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p><b>What is the happiest time you can point back to and remember?<br></b>When I got married and when my son was born. I picked these two occasions because I think these are things I couldn't do on my own. They were a joint effort. Even though I didn’t give birth to my son, his birth is something I did with my wife. I think that sense of working together with her gave me extreme joy.</p> <p><b>Based on your experience, what is the best way to live without regret and take advantage of your time?</b><br>I’m not a good person to talk to about spending time wisely... But when you try to do something big, there tends to be a wall or obstacle in front of you. If you’re faced with a big wall, you should take your time to overcome it. Never give up. That’s my advice.</p><p><i>Follow Wilbert on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wilbertlcooper/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>. </i></p>",

Keiko from <i>Free Willy</i> is decomposing off the coast of Norway. Harambe was donated to science. Air Bud is... huh. Where’s Air Bud’s grave?</p> <p>A search on findagrave.com offers few details. The site—essentially a big database of gravesite locations—has an active community, with users regularly uploading photos of graves to the service, like a goth Instagram.</p> <p>Air Bud’s <a href=\"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7731094/buddy_the_dog\" target=\"_blank\">page on the site</a> features his black and white headshot. Users have posted over a thousand tribute comments, mostly small GIFs featuring images of puppies and rainbows. One user, named Pieter, has logged six comments in the last year. Under “burial location,” the page says, “Cremated, ashes given to family or friend, specifically: Ashes are buried in an undisclosed area by his owner.”</p> <p>The location of Air Bud’s grave is important. After all, you can tell a lot about a society by how it honors its fallen heroes. Did he get only a crummy cement plaque? An elaborate tomb filled with valuable trinkets and comical booby-traps? Was he covertly rolled off a military ship into the Arabian Sea?</p> <hr><p>For those unfamiliar, <i>Air Bud</i> is a 1997 kids' movie about a golden retriever who can play basketball. It was made as a platform to showcase the skills of a dog called Buddy, who could actually sink baskets.</p> <p>It isn’t the first movie to portray an animal playing a sport. There’s a whole genre of such films. Others include <i>Bonzo Goes To College</i> (1952), in which a chimp plays golf and football; <i>Gus </i>(1976) in which a mule from Yugoslavia plays football, <i>Matilda</i> (1978) in which a Kangaroo boxes, and <i>Ed</i> (1996) in which a monkey plays baseball.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvf0WWxrYRM\" data-iframely-id=\"T5kdcp3\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/T5kdcp3?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div><p><i>Air Bud </i>is by far the most successful film in the genre, making $27 million box office against a $3 million budget. And it remains relevant in pop culture; in recent years, a line from the film—“ain’t nothin’ in the rulebook that says a dog can’t play basketball”—became a meme, getting an <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1552/\" target=\"_blank\">XKCD reference</a> and its own <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAthleteLoophole\" target=\"_blank\">TV Tropes page</a>.</p><p>(I reached out to numerous NBA refs to attempt to fact check whether there is anything in the rulebook that says a dog can't play basketball, but none of them answered. So I looked at the official NBA rules, and there is indeed nothing in the rulebook about dogs. So, as long as Buddy followed all the other regulations, it’s conceivable he could ball.)</p> <p>The movie kicked off a fourteen-film franchise, including four “official” Air Bud films, focusing on the dog’s role in various other sports (football, soccer, baseball, and volleyball), and additional “Air Buddies” spin-off films in which Air Bud’s children (Buddy fucks) get into all sorts of crazy hijinks, eventually rocketing off into space.</p> <p>It could be argued that none of the subsequent films in the franchise are canon. For one, they use digital effects to show the dogs playing sports, and they don’t star the original Buddy; all of the sequels were released after Buddy's 1998 death.</p> <hr><p>I started my search for Buddy's grave on Google Street View. My initial guess was that the ashes were buried on the property of Kevin DiCicco, the man who rescued and trained Buddy. </p><p>I found what I believed to be DiCicco’s address via an old real estate listing for a plot of land outside of San Diego. <br></p> <p>I zoomed around in 3D view. The property has a football field and a basketball court. This seemed promising, the ideal location for training a new line of Air Buds. But stoned internet sleuthing can only take one so far. I couldn’t spot any obvious dog graves. </p> <hr><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515447095219-MV5BMTQ3NzA4MjQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE0NTA4MTE_V1_SX1478_CR001478999_AL_.jpeg\"></picture><div>Buddy with Kevin Zegers in a scene from <i>Air Bud</i>. Photo via Walt Disney Pictures</div></div><p>The appearance of Air Bud is nearly as mysterious as the location of his remains. DiCicco was hiking in northern California when Buddy suddenly walked out of the woods, hungry and disheveled. After taking him home to San Diego, DiCicco decided to do what anyone else would: teach him basketball.</p> <p>On August 21, 1990, after months of training, Air Bud sank his first shot. It should be noted that he only played basketball in a technical sense. That is to say, his central skill was shooting—though it’s kind of a stretch to call it that. The move went something like this: (1) A ball was passed to Buddy at the appropriate speed/trajectory (2) he “bumped” it with his nose and (3) the ball bounced off the backboard into the hoop. He was not able to dribble or aim or pass or play defense, and doesn’t appear to have understood the overall objective of the game.</p><p>Which isn't to say the trick was unimpressive. It definitely isn't easy to perform. You try standing on your knees below a regulation-sized rim, and clunking a basketball into it using only your big dumb head with any kind of proficiency. Besides, how many other basketball-playing dogs have you witnessed in your lifetime?</p><p>DiCicco rented a video camera, filmed Buddy completing his trick, and mailed two copies of the footage to the<i> Late Show with David Letterman</i> and<i> America’s Funniest Home Videos</i>. Both shows booked him.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85gnR_1Og1Y\" data-iframely-id=\"Xmd7yEy\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/Xmd7yEy?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>The trick was a hit. DiCicco started getting offers to have Buddy to appear at NBA halftime shows, in marketing stunts for Pedigree dog food and Big Dogs clothing, and on <i>Full House</i>. DiCicco was eventually able to leverage this fame into a film deal with Disney, resulting in <i>Air Bud</i>. </p><p>Unfortunately, Buddy didn’t have much time to enjoy his success. According to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16200409-go-buddy\" target=\"_blank\">a book about him</a>that DiCicco wrote, in late 1997, he developed a limp in his right hind leg, and a vet diagnosed him with synovial cell sarcoma. He had his leg amputated, and began undergoing chemotherapy treatments. After that, his decline was swift. In 1998, while taping a segment for <i>Access Hollywood</i> with his <i>Air Bud</i> co-star, Kevin Zegers, Buddy had a seizure, defecating and urinating on himself. It’s not clear if <i>Access Hollywood</i> caught it on film, but it’s possible that, like Brandon Lee’s death footage or the rumored racist <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tom-arnold-reports-racist-recordings-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump Apprentice tapes</a>, it's still locked in a studio vault somewhere.<br><br>The cancer had spread to Buddy’s brain, and he was left blind in one eye. According to DiCicco's book, a skittish Disney was no longer interested in having Buddy help promote their hit film, as they feared the dog’s brush with mortality might traumatize children. DiCicco began planning his own sequel film, which <a href=\"http://ew.com/article/1998/04/03/pooch-comes-shove/\" target=\"_blank\">he described to <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> as a “cross between <i>Ferris Bueller</i> and <i>Home Alone</i>” and would potentially star Pamela Anderson. It was never made.</p> <p>Over the next few months, Buddy’s symptoms worsened as the cancer spread to his lungs. While picking up some new puppies in Cleveland, DiCicco got a late night phone call from his dogsitter back west: Air Bud had died.</p> <hr><p>After fruitlessly searching far and wide for contact details, I was eventually put in touch with DiCicco by a friend of mine who'd heard from him after writing a piece about <i>Air Bud</i> last year. I was nervous. It’s uncomfortable to call up a stranger and ask them where they buried their dead dog.<br></p> <p>But that's what I did. DiCicco told me that, after Buddy died, he had a falling out with Disney. He didn’t want to go into detail about the litigation—which concerned who created the Air Bud character—but ultimately he had nothing to do with the sequels. This includes the direct-to-DVD sequel <i>Snow Buddies</i>, during the film of which five <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/12/snow-buddies-killed-five-puppies\" target=\"_blank\">puppies died</a>. </p><hr><p><b><i>Watch:</i></b></p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/menswear-dog-the-most-stylish-dog-on-instagram/599ddd3820fe9cf86a77c9f9\" data-iframely-id=\"fNqYzHk\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/fNqYzHk\"></iframe></div></div> <p>DiCicco sounded tired when talking about the <i>Air Bud</i> experience, and said he wanted to move on. “We’ve already done everything we can with it,” he said. “There’s nothing left.” He’s working on a program outside of the Air Bud brand, that teaches shelter dogs various sports, the idea being that learning a skill like basketball might make the otherwise unwanted dogs more appealing, and help get them adopted. He’s been pitching the concept as a reality show or a potential brand tie-in with a pet store.</p><p>DiCicco also froze eleven vials of Buddy’s semen. There are still a couple vials of Air Bud cum left, stored in a freezer at the International Canine Semen Bank (Dicicco said Buddy has posthumously fathered three litters of puppies).</p> <p>After Buddy passed, DiCicco planned on taking his remains to Northern California. “I was going to bury him at my cabin, where he came from.” Unfortunately, the timing didn’t work out. It was in the middle of winter, and there was too much snow on the ground. “I mentally wasn’t prepared for that.”</p> <p>DiCicco no longer owns the land I'd been trying to find on Street View—which he calls &quot;Buddy Farm.&quot; I asked if that was where they spread his ashes. “No, we did not do that there,” he said, “that was more of a beach thing, but that’s something I don’t really make public.”</p><p>I tried to ask him the location several times, but he’d only give me vague answers, then change the subject. He talked about his dream of one day buying Buddy Farm back (if he can get his shelter dog training concept off the ground), about maybe one day opening an Air Bud museum (“we have all this memorabilia…”), and about the complications of getting Buddy a star on the Walk of Fame (though he definitely deserves one).</p><p>Eventually, he told me he'd spread the ashes on Pacific Beach in San Diego, but wouldn't be more specific. It wasn’t an exact location, but it was good enough. I started to feel cruel for asking. He was obviously still affected by the death of Buddy. Who isn’t? <br></p> <p>We might never know the exact location of Air Bud’s tomb. Maybe that’s okay. Heroes are more than their corporeal forms. Their myths live on long after their withered bodies are covered in topsoil. Still, I like to think that after his ashes were spread on that beach—wherever it was—they made their way into the air and sea, and now Air Bud is a part of us all.</p><p><i>Follow Joe Veix on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeveix\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

        "content": "<p>There exists an obscure genre of porn in which an actor dressed in a mass-market sea monster costume has his slimy, scaly way with terrorized female performers. </p><p>More than 100 clips of this niche fetish exist on various websites, shot by different production teams. But in each video, they use the same costume, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zagone-Studios-Mens-Creature-Shirt/dp/B00F5ZCZLW\" target=\"_blank\">made by Zagone Studios in Illinois</a>. The videos aren't produced by traditional adult entertainment studios, but are part of a cottage industry that makes porn commissioned by private fans. Much of this consumer-driven smut consists of foot worship, faux-incest, face-sitting, femdom flicks, and other more recognizable fetish categories. But what makes the sea monster genre unique is that the entire canon appears to have been commissioned by a single patron.</p> <p>“There’s just this <i> one</i> German guy,” said Guda*, who co-runs <a href=\"http://www.bitchslapstudios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitch Slap Studios</a> and its “monsters, aliens, superheroines” imprint, <a href=\"http://xxxtremecomixxx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xxxtremecomixxx</a>. Guda explained to me that this mystery man “has spent who knows how much money” to produce possibly all of the existing sea monster porn content.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/avatar-sex-scanning-pornstars-into-virtual-reality/565ca5cb15d0aae653606acf\" data-iframely-id=\"ol5UPg7\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/ol5UPg7\"></iframe></div></div> <p>It's impossible to say definitively that this man is the<i> only</i> person creating sea monster porn, but <i> at the very least</i> we know that he's creating the vast majority of it. It’s hard to tell exactly how many films the superfan has ordered because some custom videos are never released for general sale and others are tough to locate. But Cory Chase, of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjvzgq/ted-cruz-was-right-twitters-great-for-porn\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Cruz Twitter porn fame</a>, who runs the porn studio Cory Chase Customs, says he has made around two dozen films for the fan in recent years. Guda, who also works as a producer, director, and actor, has made about five dozen films for the fan since 2009. Guda also told me one of his colleagues, who used to produce clips at his own studio and now works at Bitch Slap Studios, has worked with the fan for even longer than that. But Guda couldn’t give me a specific range of years or number of films.</p> <p>From $100 to upwards of $15,000, custom porn studios will make almost anything a fetishist wants (<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev4we4/dead-ass-who-is-consuming-necro-porn\" target=\"_blank\">think: necro porn</a>), so long as the customer provides them with a few specifications and the cash upfront to cover the costs. In this case, this mysterious fan sends a producer like Guda a script detailing the monster fucking that he wants to see and the costume from Zagone Studios. </p> <p>(When I emailed Zagone to ask if they were aware that one of their costumes had become a feature of a sub-genre of fetish porn, a member of the sales and marketing team responded, “We did not know that our Sea Creature Costume was being used in pornographic films. We hope the actors find the costume comfortable, easy to wear, and that the audience enjoys the artistic beauty of the costume.&quot;)</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5xbyd/inside-the-often-sexless-world-of-giantess-porn\" data-iframely-id=\"9PFxtiM\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/9PFxtiM?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>I wanted to speak directly to the mystery fan and find out exactly what it is about monster fucking that he enjoys. So, I asked some of the studios he's worked with to pass along an interview request. Unfortunately, but perhaps understandably, he declined to talk about these videos or his interest in the scenarios they depict. And none of the producers I spoke with have ever discussed with the fan what he finds so alluring about the sea monster, either. He simply sends notes, the suit (if the company doesn’t have one already), and email clarifications when necessary.</p> <p>However, Bitch Slap Studios provided me with notes he submitted to them for a recent hour-long sea monster shoot, which offers a little insight. “I just want wide open regular missionary without any fancy variations. Just a lot of angles from that basic pose,” reads the notes. &quot;Either all of the girl and monster, mostly the girl and some monster, but never mostly the monster and some girl.” He takes great pains to specify that the girl should be naked throughout the shoot. He wants to see as much torso as possible, and he always wants to be able to see her face. Sim fucking, in which one performer just dry humps another, is fine. But if a cock is shown, he prefers the production team use a strap-on monster dildo (like something from <a href=\"https://bad-dragon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Dragon</a>). The important thing, it seems, is seeing the woman reacting to the monster.</p> <p>Ultimately, the final products vary significantly by studio, especially when it comes to their interpretation of the monster. In clips like <i> The Horny Monster from Beyond</i> (2014), Peachy Keen Films—a studio from which I’ve found about three dozen monster clips via one of their distribution channels—plays the character campy with the monster making wavy arm motions and screaming, “Nya nya!” Guda plays it more serious, with growling and menace in <i> Sea Monster Got Me </i>(2017) or <i>O</i><i>ut of the Abyss </i>(2017). Chase, who often plays the monster herself, uses a bright green strap-on for fucking in <i> Alli Rae in Swamp Monster vs the Beauty</i> (2014) and <i> Melanie Hicks in the Swamp Monster Attacks </i>(2016). The studio Chris’ Corner, on the other hand, just has a male performer dangle his pink, human dick out of the black slacks he wears under the monster shirt in <i> A Monster Rape</i> (2016). (This is the only monster video I have found from Chris’ Corner, but their archives are not easily searchable.) Although Chase’s videos almost always feature penetration with a dildo, Guda and others usually just stick to sim fucking. </p> <p>The fan appears less fond of campiness, though. “I want a horror feel without any goofy/funny monster behavior,” he writes in the same order form. The abbreviated blow-by-blow of the scene specifies that the monster should roar and hiss. The actress “is terrified, so crying, pleading, struggling, etc. She hates it and shows it but lets him have his way with her from fear. Obvious looks of shock, terror, and fear from her... The monster gets off on her fear!”</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkbwd5/an-oral-history-of-the-moneyshot\" data-iframely-id=\"kiNEOjG\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/kiNEOjG?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>We don't know what drives the customer behind the sea monster genre. But every producer I interviewed about monster fetishes like this—there is a broader canon out there of more widely consumed witch and vampire fuck films—suspected that their customers’ desires stemmed from some hardwiring that happened after watching a horror movie in their adolescence. In this fan’s case, seeing a beast carry away a breathy maiden, who is terrified at first but succumbs to the creature’s animalistic force—á la <i> Dracula</i>, <i> King Kong</i>, or <i> Creature from the Black Lagoon—</i>could have been a formative erotic experience. This makes some intuitive sense, because <a href=\"https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/orsp_horizons_kershner_f06.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">these creatures</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/king-kong-skull-island-movies-metaphors\" target=\"_blank\">and their films</a> <a href=\"http://www.ferdyonfilms.com/2013/creature-from-the-black-lagoon-1954/19509/\" target=\"_blank\">are often sexually charged</a>. The beast-eroticism connection theoretically gets baked-in and becomes a strong turn-on later in life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ntu.ac.uk/staff-profiles/social-sciences/mark-griffiths\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Griffiths</a>, an expert in the psychology of sexual fetishes at Britain’s Nottingham Trent University, agreed with this broad speculative explanation. He told me, “Most research into the origins of paraphilias and fetishes suggests that it starts in childhood and adolescence via associative pairing of something sexual with a fetish object that is not normally considered sexual.”</p> <p>Whatever’s driven this fan’s habits for so many years, he probably can’t keep the sub-genre afloat forever. Chase, in fact, said that orders have dropped off in recent years. Guda credits this to the fact that some studios, to make up for losses due to piracy and intense competition, have had to raise their rates. “He only orders from us when we have a local model that he likes, because it’s less expensive for him,” said Guda, rather than paying to fly in a performer from Los Angeles, Miami, or New York for a week of shoots.</p> <p>Studios, however, may not miss the super fan’s business entirely. According to everyone I’ve spoken to who’s worn the costume, it's hot and hard to see out of, making even simulated fucking difficult. Plus, it involves growling and acting like a convincing monster-movie beast while trying to grind away on someone. “We had this one model who was wearing the costume for us, and she just quit altogether,” recalled Guda, “because she was just hating life” while wearing it.</p> <p>While Chase said the sales on monster porn in general are pretty good, Guda notes that sea monster scenes sell like crap. His best-performing clip has seen maybe 80 or 90 downloads in five years. More people have probably accessed it via pirated copies, but that’s barely enough to cover basic pay for his cast and crew, which go beyond the production costs the fan's payments cover. For him, the sub-genre breaks even at best.</p> <p>Basically, if this one patron ever drops out of the market, the entire sea monster porn genre would probably dry up. In some ways, it makes the genre unimpressive: It didn’t spark a trend, awaken widespread desires, or change even a niche audience’s perceptions of sexuality. But it does show how disruptive the custom porn model can be. All you need is one person with a few thousand dollars and a very specific kink. If they have the time and the desire, they can flood the market with content, making it seem to unsuspecting searchers as though their singular desires are legion.</p> <p>“Sometimes I wonder,” said Guda, about what drives custom porn consumers. “But I could probably get into all sorts of crazy hypotheses about this stuff.” Best, he maintains, not to think too hard, and just roll with it.</p><p><i>*In the fetish world, some performers, producers, and directors go by mononyms or aliases.

        "content": "<p>This New Year's Eve at Man's Country, a Chicago bathhouse open since 1973, hundreds of men, women, transgender and nonbinary people showed out for a dance party celebrating the last hours of a queer American landmark. </p><p>Appropriately titled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/308995272917344/\" target=\"_blank\">Loose Ends</a>,&quot; the closing event was part funeral, part rebirth and all hedonistic rager. Patrons danced, cruised, drank, caressed, hallucinated, sauna'd and paid their respects from before midnight to well past 11 AM. It was both a throwback to the venue's heyday, before the internet made many bathhouses feel obsolete, and a glimpse at what could have been had they thrown more events like this, which balanced sleaze with sociability and made the place appealing to those beyond the aging gay generation for which it was <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvnaxw/mans-country-a-mans-club-for-men\" target=\"_blank\">once a mecca</a>.</p><p>Man's Country wore its history on its walls, with portraits of famous patrons, nude men, and other artwork throughout reminding visitors that this wasn't some staid, humorless bathhouse. In the basement (dubbed &quot;The Pit,&quot;) a huge sauna—once billed as the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-life-mans-country-bathhouse-closing-1230-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">largest in the Midwest</a>—sat opposite a shower and wet area modeled after Parisian sewers. In its past, part of the cavernous Man's Country space was transformed into a dance club called Bistro Too, where acts like Boy George, Divine, and major disco stars performed, shifting some focus away from sex in the wake of the AIDS crisis. It also played host to a leather bar called the Chicago Eagle, <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/love-and-sex/2017/11/29/facing-closure-chicagos-oldest-bathhouse-throws-epic-party-ages\" target=\"_blank\">one of many</a> titanic contributions its founder, the consummate leather daddy Chuck Renslow, made to the leather community.</p><p>After Renslow's death in 2016—following years in which Man's Country failed to turn a profit—its end seemed all but inevitable, as it <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/jpddjk/can-gay-dating-apps-replace-gay-bars-opinions-vary\" target=\"_blank\">has</a> for <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/dpk8kk/meet-the-agender-alternative-queer-nightlife-replacing-the-disappearing-lesbian-bar\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> of America's aging LGBTQ venues. Following its final night, the owners held an estate sale for everything and anything inside, from architectural elements to artwork to the disco balls that patterned its dance floors for decades. Before the big teardown, VICE sent photographer <a href=\"http://brittanysowacke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brittany Sowacke</a> to tour the club and capture what made the space charming, otherworldly and utterly unique—the kind of atmosphere increasingly disappearing from antiseptic LGBTQ venues today.<br></p><div><picture><source

Today, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger, who certainly needs no introduction. Late last year, he starred in </i>Killing Gunther<i>, which you can catch now </i><i>on VOD.</i></p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeLp9-k9-LQ\" data-iframely-id=\"ViQu1W8\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/ViQu1W8?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div><p>Going to a movie was almost unheard of as kids. We were poor and living in a village where there was no theater. We had to go to the main capital to do so, maybe once a year. The first movie I ever saw—I didn’t know what it was, a John Wayne movie. My brother and I had no idea how the screen worked, so we were really frightened that we were going to get run over by horses and and nailed with arrows. We were ducking and jumping under our seats. It was a frightening experience, but my mother and father were laughing their head off. It was a wild experience.</p> <p>Austria was too small for me. I felt the opportunities were not there, and that I was in the wrong place. We were occupied by Allied forces, and there was a lot of crime. Every time I saw pictures of America, I thought, <i> That’s where I belong</i>. My big dream was to come to America—the question was just, “How?” </p> <p>When I stumbled onto bodybuilding, I felt that it was an American sport and a means to the end. My vision was, if I won Mr. Universe and all the titles, America would eventually invite me over. At 21 years old, my vision became a reality. I became Mr. Universe for the second time, and I got this telegram from the publisher of <i> Muscle</i>, Joe Weider. He said, “Arnold, you’re the new sensation. I want to you to come to America. I’ll put you up in Muscle Beach, you’ll train with the champions, you can write for our magazine, and we can get you into the movies. That’s why I’m a big believer in having a vision, no matter how young you are. The more clear you are about your vision, the more clear you can be with the action you can take to turn it into reality. </p> <p>I’m not an expert in meditation, but I once worked out with someone in the mid 1970s that was an expert in transcendental meditation. He invited me to the center in Brentwood, where they taught me how to meditate. At the time, my life had a lot of pressure. I was bodybuilding, training to compete for Mr. Olympia again, doing construction work for extra money, going to acting classes, and attending college. There was a lot of stuff on my plate, and I needed to find a way to calm down from my anxiety. </p> <p>Transcendental meditation really helped me. Ever since, I started seeing different goals in my life that I could sort out calmly and emphatically. People always say there’s a lot of Eastern philosophy in me—I don’t know about that, because I’m not an expert, but you can learn a lot from all the different approaches.</p> <p>Everything I visualized—to become rich and famous—happened. As I pursued those dreams, other things started happening that were not my dream. I had no idea I’d do comedies—I just thought I’d be one of those muscle guys in Hercules movies, but I did comedies, dramas, and I had the most successful movie of the year with <i> Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>. I didn’t dream that I’d get involved with charitable organizations and help kids, or hang out with presidents. I didn’t dream I’d become governor of California. I had no idea I’d be a crusader for the environment. When you grow up, your vision changes and you dream about other things. It’s part of evolving as a person—growing up, becoming more mature and interested in issues that are bigger than yourself.</p> <p>I don’t think America’s changed that much since I moved here. When I came here, it was the land of opportunity, and it still is. When I travel around the world, people still want to come to America, California specifically. America was number one, and it still is. Look at how people help each other when there’s fires, floods, and hurricanes, how people help each other. It’s the American spirit, and that’s what I love about this country. </p> <p>There is, of course, upheaval and confusion. When I came over in ‘68, there was the Democratic convention in Chicago, with the riots. The Vietnam war, with people dying everyday on the battlefield—total chaos. The hippie movement, people smoking dope trying to getting rid of the problems. Patty Hearst getting kidnapped. Watergate. Carter coming in and creating an economic disaster. I’ve seen America go through some very difficult moments, and we’re going through difficult moments now, in a way—but I don’t think anyone should ever confuse it with the deterioration of America. </p> <p>I’m a person that doesn’t believe in whining—I believe in action. Don’t sit in front of the TV and say, “Something’s wrong.” Go out and solve problems—for after-school kids, the environment, gerrymandering and redistricting. Instead of complaining, let’s do something about it. Some people say, “Love it or leave it.” I say, “Love it or change it.” That’s me.</p>",

According to Kamloops This Week, he had a 2016 court date adjourned because he was at camp with his hockey team. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/qvv5zv/a-hockey-players-assault-sentence-was-postponed-so-it-wouldnt-hurt-his-internship\" data-iframely-id=\"METpBnL\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/METpBnL?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Over the course of Neurauter’s relationship with the girl, she told police that he once choked her with his hands and later asked her for naked photographs in texts and on Snapchat. Eventually, she told a girlfriend who is 14; the friend sent Neurauter nude photos of herself in an attempt to get him to leave the victim alone. Neurauter was arrested after the friend told her mother what was going on and she called police. </p> <p>The girl read aloud a victim impact statement in court, saying she was paranoid that she would run into Neurauter when out in public. </p> <p>“I was very scared because he knew where I lived and knew where my room was,” she said. </p> <p>The victim’s mother <a href=\"http://calgarysun.com/news/national/outrage-over-delayed-sentence-for-hockey-player-convicted-of-sex-crime-against-child\" target=\"_blank\">told the Calgary Sun </a>she’s frustrated by how many concessions the court has made to accommodate Neurauter’s schedule. </p> <p>“Sorry, he’s unavailable for court because he has a hockey tournament. He’s unavailable for court because he has exams. He’s unavailable to come to his plea on his own because he’s in the middle of studying,” she said. </p> <p>“Let’s postpone his jail sentence until May so he can finish a year in college. Nobody has stood up and said no, during the whole thing—there was not one time where the judge or even the Crown said ‘please, this is not right.’ The victims are the ones who have been paying over and over, every time we went to court.”</p> <p>The case seems to be part of a trend through which the courts accommodate young men guilty of violence against women. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_nz/video/how-women-are-dismissing-roy-moore-sexual-assault-allegations/5a0f0657177dd43f8b6e9cd3?popular=1\" data-iframely-id=\"3aBaH6y\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/3aBaH6y\"></iframe></div></div><p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/pazgx9/a-judge-let-off-a-domestic-abuser-so-he-could-get-into-university\" target=\"_blank\">VICE reported on a case out of Newfoundland</a> in which a 21-year-old man was given an absolute discharge after pleading guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Judge Lori Marshall said the abuser, Lancelot Saunders, will be “very successful in life.” </p> <p>“You’re a young person with your whole life ahead of you and the implications of a criminal conviction, a permanent criminal record, could have longstanding repercussions for you,” she said, noting a conviction would prevent him from getting into college. </p> <p>Hockey player and Queen’s University student, Chance Macdonald, who assaulted a teenage girl at a party, was not sentenced until last September so that his internship could remain intact. </p> <p>Barb Macquarrie, community director at Western University's Centre for Research and Education on Violence against Women and Children, told VICE the justice system is sending the message that these crimes aren’t serious enough to be dealt with immediately. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/pazgx9/a-judge-let-off-a-domestic-abuser-so-he-could-get-into-university\" data-iframely-id=\"1bj0LZC\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/1bj0LZC?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>“I’m sure it took a lot for her to come forward, a lot,” she said of Neurauter’s 13-year-old victim. “She got very minimal validation from the system. It’s almost as if the system is apologizing to the offender.” </p> <p>Macquarrie said she would like to see more straight talk in courtrooms so that offenders like Neurauter understand the gravity of their actions. The alleged choking is a very high-risk behavior that doesn’t appear to have been addressed by the court, she said. </p> <p>“We’re potentially missing some warning signs of somebody who could become a much more dangerous offender,” she said. </p> <p>In sentencing, judges factor in mitigation and rehabilitation, though Macquarrie was skeptical that non-athletes and men of color would be treated with the same leniency as offenders like Neurauter and Macdonald. While Macquarrie said there’s no problem with allowing an offender to continue their education, “unless they really, really come to terms with how problematic this behavior is, they don’t have much of a future anyway.” </p><p>Neurauter's sentence, which includes two years of probation, will commence on May 4. He will also have to register as a sex offender and his DNA will be included in the national database. </p> <p><i> Follow Manisha Krishnan on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/manishakrishnan\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

I want her to run for president,” Meryl Streep <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/01/08/meryl-streep-just-endorsed-an-oprah-winfrey-presidential-run/?utm_term=.00747ec7300b\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the <i>Washington Post</i>. &quot;Call me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Oprah\" target=\"_blank\">@oprah</a>. I've got some Iowa county chairs who would love to hear from you,&quot; Obama's 2012 Iowa campaign manager <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonnobleDMR/status/950383032095117312\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a>. Even conservatives John Podhoretz and Bill Kristol <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/09/27/democrats-best-hope-for-2020-oprah/?utm_campaign=iosapp&utm_source=mail_app\" target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/950399812070985728\" target=\"_blank\">voiced</a> support for an Oprah presidency, proof that 2018 isn't shaping up to be any more sane than 2017 or 2016.</p> <p>I'm not going to deny the power of Oprah's speech, which was undoubtedly the highlight of a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xewyd/the-hits-and-misses-of-the-2018-golden-globes\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes awkward Golden Globes</a>. &quot;We all know the press is under siege these days,&quot; said the billionaire media mogul in one particularly rousing bit. &quot;But we also know it’s the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice, to tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies.&quot;</p> <p>And I'm not going to criticize Winfrey's politics, which seem fairly progressive. What's more, she's done more than most celebrities to actually effect change: In the 90s, for instance, she helped lobby for the <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/oprah-calls-for-action-against-child-predators\" target=\"_blank\">National Child Protection Act</a>, which created a database of known abusers and became known as the &quot;Oprah bill.&quot; </p> <p>But can we let celebrities just be celebrities? Or to put it a little more pointedly, have we learned nothing from Donald Trump?</p> <p>Weirdly enough, in 1999, Trump himself suggested that if he ran for president, Oprah <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/08/trump-1999-lkl-oprah-vp-sot.cnn/video/playlists/oprah-winfrey/\" target=\"_blank\">would be</a> his first choice for running mate. &quot;Americans respect and admire Oprah for her intelligence and caring. She has provided inspiration for millions of women to improve their lives, go back to school, learn to read, and take responsibility for themselves,&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/950398469499510789\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in his book.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/trump-impeachment/5a0e1a0e177dd454a93ddc61\" data-iframely-id=\"xBafkof\"></div> <p>Trump isn't wrong about Oprah, but being an &quot;inspiration&quot; doesn't mean someone should run for president. Trump himself was &quot;inspiring&quot; to many Americans who voted for him despite all his obviously disqualifying traits. We don't need any more &quot;inspirational&quot; politicians, we need people who have actual experience governing. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/public-speaking-tips-from-donald-trump/59ee0f7d177dd41d0b730655\" data-iframely-id=\"RN62sL7\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/RN62sL7\"></iframe></div></div> <p>Oprah, unlike Trump, is actually a self-made billionaire. She doesn't traffic in openly racist rhetoric and hasn't been accused of sexual assault, either. She'd be a step up from Trump for a lot of reasons. But like him, she has no political experience, and no obvious platform beyond her (incredible) personal appeal.</p> <p>Here's what we know about Oprah's political views: She's seemingly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacobkornbluh/status/950411758820364290\" target=\"_blank\">pro-Israel</a>. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/09/oprah-winfrey-neoliberal-capitalist-thinkers\" target=\"_blank\">believes</a> in the American dream in a sort of Obama-esque way. She <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/08/oprah-for-president-in-2020-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/?utm_term=.e7c1852be024\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed</a> Obama for president in 2008 and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/oprah-winfrey-endorses-clinton-224408\" target=\"_blank\">Hillary Clinton</a> over Trump in 2016. She <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080622181458/http://www.la-starz.com/HurricaneKatrina_CelebrityEfforts.html\" target=\"_blank\">donated $10 million</a> to Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Where does she stand on healthcare? Weed legalization? Foreign policy? Housing? </p> <p>Importantly, even though the media has spent the last 12 hours spinning its collective wheels about an Oprah campaign, the candidate herself is actually not a candidate, at least not yet. As recently as June, Oprah <a href=\"http://www.ktvq.com/story/37216816/6-times-oprah-stoked-or-shot-down-2020-speculation\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a>, &quot;I will never run for public office,&quot; but since the Golden Globes she might have had a change of heart. On Monday morning, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/08/media/oprah-golden-globes/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNN reported</a> that according to two sources close to Oprah, she is now &quot;actively thinking&quot; about running for president. </p> <p>If Oprah wants to run for political office, she should go for it—but not the presidency. She should start small, which for her would mean a cabinet post in a Democratic administration or a governorship. We don't have any idea about how she would fare in that sort of job; maybe she'd be amazing at it, but maybe she's more suited to her current incredibly powerful job. If you have enough hubris to want to run for presidency with zero political experience, it's a good indicator that being president probably isn't the right gig for you. And if Trump's presidency has taught us anything, it's this: Don't trust a billionaire to do the job of a politician.</p> <p><i>Follow Eve Peyser on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/evepeyser\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i> </p>",

According to the fire department's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FDNY/status/950375457416982528\" target=\"_blank\">statement on Twitter</a>, two civilians and one firefighter sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the process.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/FDNY/status/950375457416982528\" data-iframely-id=\"QnqASCU\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/QnqASCU?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>The president was not in the building at the time of the fire, but his son and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmqym8/the-gop-really-wants-you-to-sign-eric-trumps-birthday-card-vgtrn\" target=\"_blank\">recent birthday boy</a>, Eric, tweeted his thanks to the fire department's speedy response.<br></p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/950358952851755009\" data-iframely-id=\"7RsGVV6\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/7RsGVV6?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>The fire was pretty small, didn't trigger an evacuation of the building, and no one was seriously injured, giving some on Twitter good excuse to stop <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/9kndma/oprah-winfrey-golden-globes-president-2020\" target=\"_blank\">obsessing over Oprah's potential presidential bid</a> and crack a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OhNoSheTwitnt/status/950367460091420672\" target=\"_blank\">seemingly</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JillW2010/status/950347268225454080\" target=\"_blank\">endless</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaryDiPasqal3/status/950430205029638147\" target=\"_blank\">slew</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DogmaChronicle/status/950347490611560448\" target=\"_blank\">of</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tcgnome/status/950430031599169536\" target=\"_blank\">jokes</a> about Trump's pants being on fire, so there's that.

        "content": "<p><i>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca\" target=\"_blank\">VICE Canada</a></i>.<br><br>It goes without saying that <i> Black Mirror</i> is one of the most bewitching sci-fi thrillers we currently have.</p> <p>Now in its fourth season, the show explores everything from <i> Star Trek</i>-inspired tech nerd revenge in (“USS Callister,”) the plight of overprotective mothers (“ArkAngel,”) and the simulated fates of star-crossed lovers (“Hang the DJ”). But it’s the finale, “Black Museum,” that speaks the loudest.</p> <p>Deemed the “<a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/39748-black-mirror-black-museum-season-4\" target=\"_blank\">White Christmas</a>” episode of the season based on its multiple storyline formula, “Black Museum” is anything but. As Nish (played by Letitia Wright, <i> Black Panther</i>) roams through Rolo Haynes’ Black Museum during a three-hour futuristic pit stop, we almost immediately shuffle in our seats.</p> <p>A dark-skinned black girl walking into an empty horror museum in the middle of the desert? What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>She’s met by Haynes himself, who takes her on a tour through his haunted house of horrors. We, along with Nish, are walked through a series of now-illegal and ethically questionable objects on display: A borderline-BDSM neurological hat that allowed a doctor to overdose on sexual pleasure from his patient’s pain, a neurological device that evicts a person’s consciousness from their body to live rent-free in someone else’s mind, and finally, a digital hologram of an incarcerated black man in a cell. We find that it’s none other than Clayton Leigh, a wrongfully-convicted murderer on death row whose consciousness is now etched in digital eternity. We’re told his story: When Haynes worked as a business med-tech (whatever that is) he visited Clay in jail and offered him a way out of his execution by digitally immortalizing his essence into a permanent hologram in exchange for money for his family.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/59w53k/im-a-black-critic-who-dismissed-the-black-museum-episode\" data-iframely-id=\"jUGh7U4\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/jUGh7U4?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Clay becomes Haynes’ primary attraction, ringing in busloads of sick white people (and one random Asian guy) to pull a lever re-enacting Leigh’s electrocution. Now, all that remains are the vacuous crumbs of Leigh’s previous self.</p> <p>This is the final straw for Nish, who reveals herself to be his daughter here on a redemptive mission to bring Haynes down.</p> <p>Nish points out the protests after Clay’s sentencing and the museum closing down, except for a few racist, voyeuristic one-offs who paid extra to keep Haynes in business. Nish condemns him to an eternal life of electrocution (solidified via souvenir) by locking Hayne’s consciousness into Clay’s virtual one and is finally able to say her goodbyes.</p> <p>Nish burns the museum down, and we find that her dead mother shares occupancy inside Nish’s mind, as well.</p> <p>Nish is proof that not all heroines wear capes.</p> <p>She reflects the unspoken grief that black people—particularly black <i> women</i>—carry. We’re often asked to bury deep emotional scars in our minds, hearts, and souls, and are almost never afforded the luxury of cerebral safety. We’re in constant fear of losing our loved ones; our sons, daughters, fathers, and brothers whose lives are unjustly snuffed out before their time.</p> <p>Because of socio-economic access, we’re also left medically neglected, not always getting the treatment we need for better mental and physical health.<a href=\"https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/ypa55y/black-womens-health-matters-but-you-wouldnt-know-it-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\"> We’re twice as likely to deal with anxiety or depression</a> and have some of the<a href=\"http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/DisparitiesInBreastCancerScreening.html\" target=\"_blank\"> highest breast cancer mortality rates</a>.</p> <p>We are emotional secret-keepers. Much like Nish’s undercover status, we’re asked to forego our feelings for the sake of “socially acceptability” (read: white fragility). We’re denied the full spectrum of our emotions in order to move through our daily professional (and sometimes personal) lives—even when flash anger is due.</p> <p>Nish’s revenge is not only justified; it’s well-deserved.</p> <p>As if operating in a parallel universe, Nish’s fictional character comes at a time when real-life 27-year-old <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vby7qy/did-racism-kill-erica-garner\" target=\"_blank\">Erica Garner</a> (daughter of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\" target=\"_blank\"> Eric Garner who died from a police chokehold</a> in 2014) recently passed following a heart attack and months after giving birth. Erica became an activist in light of her father’s death and not only had to face the state’s<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/03/chokehold-grand-jury/19804577/\" target=\"_blank\"> glaring miscarriage of justice</a> but all the media discourse that also came with it.</p> <p>Much like Nish and Clay, “Black Museum” also puts us face to face with past realities like the<a href=\"http://www.history.com/news/the-father-of-modern-gynecology-performed-shocking-experiments-on-slaves\" target=\"_blank\"> gynecological experimentation of enslaved Black women</a>, the<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/05/16/youve-got-bad-blood-the-horror-of-the-tuskegee-syphilis-experiment/?utm_term=.5bb10b1b483e\" target=\"_blank\"> Tuskegee syphilis experiment</a> in the 1930s, the<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\"> forced sterilization of Native American women</a> in the 1970s, and beyond.</p> <p>It’s horror histories like these that make this episode so daunting.</p> <p>In the past, radicalized characters on <i> Black Mirror</i> (and many British shows for that matter) feel almost inadvertently present and largely ignored, leaving audiences to interpret racial subtext for themselves. <i> Skins</i> (considered the British Degrassi) barely acknowledges faith-based and racial differences. Race is almost entirely ignored in gritty supernatural drama <i> Misfits</i> to the point where it almost <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Misfits_(TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\">feels unnatural when Nathan acknowledges Curtis’ Blackness</a>.</p> <p>But it’s hard not to read into the corrective Godlike punishment for Biblical transgressions in episodes like “White Bear” where Victoria (Lenora Crichlow), a Black woman, is repeatedly shocked out of her memory after participating in a child murder, later becoming a shamebot to be paraded through the streets in a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK7L1AR-NcQ\" target=\"_blank\"> Cersei-esque Walk-of-Shame</a>.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/embed/video/vice-talks-film-with-riz-ahmed/58e4d272c7777fef2466e02f?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=mbp9my&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>It’s equally as difficult to turn a blind eye to Bing’s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHjIXCCHh3s\" target=\"_blank\"> cog-in-the-machine breakdown</a> in “Fifteen Million Merits” where Bing (Daniel Kaluuya) is a part of a simulated slave-like institution that requires its society to ride bikes to power their surroundings and earn “merits.” In a fight against the system that pressured his love into a life of pornography, Bing punches his screen, hides a piece of glass, gets his merits up, and manages to get back on the show to threaten to take his own life. But his protest is quickly turned to parody as he becomes a part of the show and is offered a weekly spot in exchange for a nicer pod—to which he accepts. <br><br> It, like “Black Museum,” is a painful episode about forcing the hands of the disenfranchised. Like Bing, Clay also isn’t left much of an option—either participate in a soul-sucking science project-like system and die (figuratively), or don’t participate and die at the hands of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/mass-incarceration-black-americans-higher-rates-disparities-report\" target=\"_blank\">system positioned against Black men</a> anyway (literally).</p> <p>Both episodes take advantage of marginalized persons wanting a better life. In “Fifteen Million Merits,” things couldn’t be any more clear: Bing’s struggle, though entertaining, is not meant to be taken seriously. And while Bing’s “rage” is contained through a system, Clay’s objections in “Black Museum” are to be contained in chains. In a cell. In the afterlife.</p> <p>In both cases, both characters are reduced to—and only kept—for one thing: profit.</p> <p>But “Black Museum” is the first time we see <i> Black Mirror</i> addressing race head-on. Does it do justice?</p> <p>As progressive as the dystopic methods in each episode are, the age-old message remains ironically regressive; that Black pain, Black trauma, and Black bodies are meant to be on literal display for an audience’s enjoyment. In some ways, it feels like the torture porn that we’ve seen time and time again: Is a commodification of the Black struggle.</p> <p>It’s a recurrent theme that leads one to ask, &quot;what is Charlie Brooker’s <i> deal</i>?&quot;</p> <p>The aforementioned episodes all obsess over the plight of being trapped in an oppressive system designed to capitalize off of [Black] suffering. They break down the mind, preserve the body, and make a mockery of pain. They leave their victims with no choice but to participate until their nothing left but hollow, empty shells.</p> <p>One can’t help but compare it to our current desensitized culture where Black deaths are widely spread across the internet like a WorldStar fight. Black people dying at the hands of injustice has become so commonplace that our world feels simulated, too. Troy Anthony Davis. Eric Garner. Sandra Bland. Tamir Rice. Mike Brown. Trayvon Martin. The list is endless.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4gmw5/why-netflix-has-decided-to-make-diversity-a-top-priority\" data-iframely-id=\"zBmyBxt\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/zBmyBxt?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>“Black Museum” also comes at an interesting time when Afrofuturism is finally starting to pick up steam. Sci-fi has<a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/how-the-x-men-reflected-the-fight-for-civil-rights-1790875215\" target=\"_blank\"> historically been used to critique systemic regimes</a> (e.g. <i> X-Men</i> or literally any Octavia Butler book), and with Afrofuturist movies like <i> Black Panther</i> and music videos like <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriennegibbs/2017/12/30/jay-z-makes-america-great-in-hotly-discussed-star-studded-family-feud-video/#5a48ded634fd\" target=\"_blank\">“Family Feud</a>,” we’re only now exploring messages outside of blaxploitation within the (sub)genre. Films like Jordan Peele’s <i> Get Out</i> that explore the nuances of experimentation on Black bodies for white advancement are only the beginning.</p> <p>But whether we’re romanticized for our sexual prowess, idolized for our artistic “eye,” or straight up demonized and locked away, make no mistake—”Black Museum” is an episode about mental incarceration. Perhaps what stings most are the ripples of a quadruple homicide effect: Clay’s unjust execution by the state, his digital remains in a continuous loop of torture, his wife’s overdose, and the annihilation of his mind. He can barely even recognize his own daughter by the end of it all, and who can blame him?</p> <p>Nevertheless, there’s a tinge of hope by the episode’s end. Clay’s wife living on as an inhabitant of Nish’s consciousness is a powerful testament to the reclamation of the Black mind. For a show that has a proven obsession with Black suffering, it seems like a subtle step in the right direction.</p><p><i>Follow Lindsey Addawoo on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindseyaddawoo?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"> Twitter.</a></i></p>",

It has also wiped out more than $8.5 million of outstanding debt in about 11,000 other cases.</p> <hr> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/inside-americas-for-profit-bail-system/569e4845a53059873bd601c6\" data-iframely-id=\"WvL3aq\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/WvL3aq\"></iframe></div></div> <hr> <p> “It’s not easy for government to look at a practice, admit it was wrong, and make a refund, but it’s the right and moral thing to do,” said John M. Gioia, a member of the county’s Board of Supervisors, which <a href=\"http://contra-costa.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?publish_id=cb4cb4f3-df9c-11e7-a872-00505691de41\" target=\"_blank\">made its decision</a> on the issue in December.</p> <p> Until last year, California state law allowed counties to bill parents for the cost of their children’s incarceration, a common policy nationwide that has recently come under wide criticism. <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/02/your-kid-goes-to-jail-you-get-the-bill\" target=\"_blank\">The Marshall Project</a> wrote about the practice in March, and in October, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/10/11/california-ends-practice-of-billing-parents-for-kids-in-detention\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> it statewide.</p> <p> Even under the previous law, California parents were not supposed to be billed if their son or daughter was ultimately found not guilty. But most counties either did not know about the provision or did not follow it.</p> <p> Billing parents for the cost of their children’s incarceration is rooted in a decades-old belief among policymakers that families are responsible for supporting their delinquent children and should not expect government to pick up the tab. But critics have challenged the policy around the country, arguing it is akin to taxing parents for a child’s loss of liberty.</p> <p> In California, advocates began fighting the fee system locally in 2016, winning moratoriums in several counties, including Contra Costa. Philadelphia also stopped the practice last year, soon after The Marshall Project story.</p> <p> Contra Costa appears to be the only California county to take the additional step of discharging all outstanding debt and repaying parents who had been improperly billed.</p> <p> Probation officials there have spent the past several months going through more than 3,000 payment accounts, searching for parents who were billed even when their child was not guilty. They are now mailing <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/4344108-Contra-Costa-Overpayment-Letter\" target=\"_blank\">form letters</a> to the last known addresses of those families, notifying them of the refund effort.</p> <p> There will also be a claims process for parents who believe they were unfairly assessed the fees earlier than 2010 or for reasons other than innocence. This could include cases in which indigent families were billed without an adequate way for them to demonstrate their income level, which was also required by the old law.</p> <p> “You never like to lose revenue, but this was a real hardship for folks—and we’re able to absorb the cost of paying them back,” said Todd Billeci, the chief probation officer in Contra Costa.</p> <p> Some activists, though, believe the Board of Supervisors has not gone far enough.</p> <p> Rebecca Brown, director of <a href=\"http://reentrysolutionsgroup.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Reentry Solutions Group</a>, a criminal justice advocacy organization that spearheaded the effort to get the fees banned and the money paid back, says the county is getting off easy. She points out that only the “wrongfully” billed parents are getting repaid, even though California law now says the whole payment system is illegal. And the probation department is refunding accounts only going back to 2010, before which it says it does not have adequate records.</p> <p> “The real reason that the county wants to claim the records don’t exist is that it opens the door to a) a lot of work and b) a much bigger pool of potential reimbursements,” Brown said. “The message is that justice reform isn’t that important in itself and shouldn’t actually cost the government anything.”</p> <p> News of the refund was bittersweet for Mariana Cuevas, whose story The Marshall Project reported last year. Her son was imprisoned more than 300 days for a crime he did not commit, but she was nonetheless billed nearly $10,000 for his detention, most of which she was not able to pay.</p> <p> Cuevas, a house cleaner in the city of Antioch, spoke at the county meeting in December when the decision to issue refunds was made.</p> <p> “Money for people who are working to survive can never be too late,” she said in an interview.</p> <p> But her son was still wrongfully jailed for all those months. “It doesn’t fix it,” she said.</p> <p><i> A version of this article was originally published by the <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/11/21/43-states-suspend-licenses-for-unpaid-court-debt-but-that-could-change?ref=hp-1-111\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall Project</a>, a nonprofit news organization that covers the US criminal justice system.

These days, managers are your friends, offices come with acceptable coffee and the occasional free beer, and suits are the last vestige of a time when work looked like, well, work. &quot;Casual Friday&quot;—the fun little bone work throws your way to give the illusion that all this labor isn't actually a burden because how can KPI analysis sessions be a burden when you're wearing jeans?—has become a way of life.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/embed/article/bj7wy4/all-hail-2002-the-worst-year-in-fashion-history?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=mbp94n&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>For the best part of half a century, a suit was what a man (not every man, it should go without saying) wore. At work or in the pub, sipping on a pint of beer, men buttoned their jackets and adjusted their hats, living out life in glorious monochrome. </p> <p>The backlash began in the late-60s, when hippies, in their stoned and infinite wisdom, realized that being tied to the bondage of capitalism through dress might have a negative impact on themselves and others. </p> <p>A decade later, punk sought to further discourage the impressionable youth of pre-Thatcher Britain from joining the corporate rat race by persuading them to spend lots and lots of money on flannel and T-shirts in <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vdz5pd/remembering-malcolm-mclaren\" target=\"_blank\">west London boutiques</a>—an inconsistency that was nicely rounded out 40 years later, when Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's son decided to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/8gkwwx/joe-corre-burn-punk-memorabilia-photos\" target=\"_blank\">burn millions of dollars</a>' worth of punk memorabilia rather than selling it and donating the money to, I don't know, literally any one of the services decimated by years of conservative policy.</p> <p>After the 1980s, which—if every documentary I’ve ever seen about the period is correct—saw the entire country howling into cell phones while sucking oysters out of each others' breast pockets, came the 90s. The suit’s decline was approaching terminal. Yes, you probably still wore one to work, but you certainly didn't on the terraces or in clubs on a Saturday night. Unless you were Jarvis Cocker—which you probably weren’t. </p><hr><p><b><i>WATCH:</i></b></p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_uk/video/vice-why-should-i-give-a-shit-about-fashion/59c3923550c7fa7d044777ce\" data-iframely-id=\"zUCVp2Y\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/zUCVp2Y\"></iframe></div></div><hr><p>The suit now stands in as a means of division between the workforce and the higher-ups, the haves and the have-lesses. This, perhaps, is why in many lines of work, we’ve seen a sartorial softening. In this post-crash, post-occupy world, companies increasingly understand that they need to be seen as cuddlier than they ever deemed necessary before.<br></p> <p>Outside of the still-suited world of finance, an easy, if incredibly superficial, way to engender an artificial sense of friendliness is to get the MD to start wearing a chore jacket and some perfectly pin-rolled denim jeans around the office. Use some petty cash to get him a blazer for when he has a business trip to Cologne to meet with potential investors, and everyone’s happy.</p> <p>Since the crash, it's been tempting to see suit-wearers as a devilish sub-sect of humanity. Viewing them as the braying ball of coke-snorting, expense-fiddling, bonus-receiving brokers and bankers who seemingly single-handedly sent the entire world into an economic head-spin is both a bit reductive <i> and</i> really cathartic.</p> <p>Think about how you react to the sight of a group of suited and booted guys in a bar or a club after work on a Friday night. If they colonize the table next to yours at six, or seven, you’ll probably be able to tolerate their guffawing, boorish banter: Everyone’s entitled to smash through four to six pints of strong beer after a hard week. Any later and it becomes distracting. They look out of place but exude a kind of monied confidence that often bulldozes into outright arrogance. I’d wager that most people reading this have an instinctual &quot;Oh God&quot; response when a horde of guys in oxfords barge their way to the bar, having decided that Corsica Studios was the perfect place to reminisce loudly about their last corporate away-day.</p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/embed/article/59d8v5/i-bullshitted-my-way-to-the-top-of-paris-fashion-week?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=mbp94n&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>That response is understandable. After all, the suit outside of a smattering of very specific non-work contexts can only ever remind of us of work—work being something that many of us dream of escaping. </p> <p>The en-masse arrival of the suit also often spells danger for allegedly-trendy areas. Gentrification occurs in three stages, and those stages are glaringly obvious if you take a second to lower your gaze and have a look at what people are wearing on their feet. The tatty Vans of the young artists become the gleaming Red Wings of the media professionals. Then, as night follows day, the boots become a pair of incredibly well-polished jet black penny loafers. The suits have arrived. The process is complete. </p> <p>All that is why, when David Cameron demanded that Jeremy Corbyn &quot;put on a proper suit, do up your tie, and sing the national anthem&quot; in early 2016, he wasn’t simply requesting that the honorable gentleman tidy himself up for another thrilling parliament encounter. Rather, Cameron was implicitly voicing a fear that a nice suit was the measure of the man was coming to an abrupt end. </p> <p>Let’s hope he was right.<br><br><i>Follow Josh Baines on</i><i> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bain3z\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter.</a></i></p><br>",

In 2016, a lot of those counties in that strip were painted red, as Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d348kw/these-pro-trump-midwestern-districts-could-swing-the-2018-midterms\" target=\"_blank\">flipped just enough of the Upper MIdwest</a> to score an electoral college victories. When I left you readers before the holidays (welcome back) I focused on districts that Obama won in 2008 in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan, but now I want to turn to the districts in other states—in that belt and elsewhere—where Democrats have been successful as little as ten years ago. With Democrats poised to have their best year since 2008 in the coming midterms, all these places deserve a closer look:</p> <h2> Pennsylvania’s 15th Congressional District (Lehigh Valley)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 44–Trump 52</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 48–Romney 51</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 52–McCain 47</i></p> <p> Ostensible moderate Representative Charlie Dent had no problem propping up the war criminals of the Bush administration or opposing everything Obama did—but found Trump a step too far. He <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/evvy9e/one-of-the-last-republican-moderates-is-quitting\" target=\"_blank\">announced his retirement last year</a> and now Republicans have to defend an open seat <a href=\"http://www.politicspa.com/ppp-pa-8-and-pa-15-voters-do-not-approve-of-gop-tax-plan/85856/\" target=\"_blank\">where a generic Republican and Democrat are polling evenly</a>. Notably, if the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/us/pennsylvania-republicans-gerrymander.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pennsylvania redistricting lawsuit</a> is successful, this district is almost guaranteed to get about 4 to 5 points more Democratic as the Lehigh Valley (Lehigh, Northampton, and Carbon counties) is almost perfectly sized to be a single congressional district. </p> <p> The Republican field has been quick to develop, with a few local elected officials announcing their runs already. The Democratic field has been slower: The most talked-about potential candidates have been former state party chair TJ Rooney, Bethlehem City Councilman Willie Reynolds, and Northampton County DA John Morganelli, but only Morganelli has made his campaign official yet. </p> <p>Rooney is well-regarded for leading the state party during the 2008 wave and would be a great get for Democrats and Reynolds is a fresh face with local elected experience. But nominating Morganelli would be a massive mistake. He’s an immigration hardliner <a href=\"http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/northampton-county/index.ssf/2016/12/tweet_to_the_top_morganelli_fo.html\" target=\"_blank\">who sent fawning tweets to Trump</a> after the election. Maybe Democrats need candidates like that in districts where Trump won by 20 points, but not here. Especially because the 15th contains the city of Allentown, which is nearly half Hispanic or Latino. Good luck turning those voters out in a midterm election with Morganelli. </p> <hr> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/public-speaking-tips-from-donald-trump/59ee0f7d177dd41d0b730655\" data-iframely-id=\"RN62sL7\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/RN62sL7\"></iframe></div></div> <hr> <h2>Pennsylvania’s 16th Congressional District (Lancaster)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 44–Trump 51</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 46–Romney 52</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 50–McCain 49</i></p> <p> Pennsylvania’s 15th District, along with the Sixth and Seventh, would likely be better for Democrats under a fairer map—that’s because under that map, they’d all take chunks out of what’s now the 16th District. Lancaster County (most of which is in the 16h) is heavily Republican and belongs with other parts of Pennsylvania on the periphery of greater Philadelphia in Berks County. So if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court comes to its senses, you can take this seat off the board.<br> <br> But for now you can leave it on. Freshman Representative Lloyd Smucker appears poised for a rematch with nonprofit executive Christina Hartman, who underperformed Clinton in a 54-43 loss in 2016. But this area contains a lot of swing voters who supported Republican congressional candidates in expectation of a providing a check on President Hillary Clinton, so Democrats shouldn’t write her off as a retread, at least not yet.</p> <h2> Pennsylvania’s Eighth Congressional District (Bucks County)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 48–Trump 48</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 49–Romney 49</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 53–McCain 46</i></p> <p> The Eighth supported the Republican presidential candidate by only a few thousand votes in each of the last two elections. So you’d expect it to be one of the most hotly contested House races in 2018, right? Well, for a while it looked like it might be a sleeper. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick cultivated a moderate reputation, and Democrats weren’t able to land a star recruit here early on. </p> <p> But with the 2018 environment poised to be a terrible one for Republicans, the Eighth is most certainly in play. Navy vet and attorney Rachel Reddick is running a feisty campaign, but some local Democrats aren’t happy that until recently <a href=\"http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/20171210/has-rachel-reddick-sunk-her-congressional-campaign-in-bucks\" target=\"_blank\">she was a registered Republican living out of state with a spotty voting record</a>, so she may be joined in the primary by wealthy philanthropist Scott Wallace, who could self-fund a campaign but <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/democrats-rise-take-republican-rep-fitzpatrick-bucks-county/\" target=\"_blank\">also has dubious ties to the district</a>. Regardless of their faults, they can be emboldened by a recent poll showing Fitzpatrick <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/943596029068312576.html?refresh=1514792790\" target=\"_blank\">losing 47-41 to a generic Democrat</a>. </p> <p> If that’s not enough for Fitzpatrick to worry about, he faces a primary challenge from a right-wing Bucks County Assistant DA Dean Malik. In a total coincidence, the similarly named Valerie Mihalek is also running in the primary and will likely peel votes from Malik. Mihalek happens to be a former staffer for Fitzpatrick’s brother Mike, who represented this seat before Brian took over. Not only is American democracy an aristocracy, but it can also be quite stupid. </p> <p> Of note, the Eighth isn’t expected to change much if the redistricting lawsuit is successful, but it could get a point or so more Democratic.</p> <hr> <p> <i><b> Read past installments from this column: </b></i> </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/house-party\" data-iframely-id=\"hAnnWMH\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/hAnnWMH?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <h2>Nebraska’s Second Congressional District (Omaha)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 46–Trump 48</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 46–Romney 53</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 50–McCain 49</i></p> <p> The Second is another Obama ‘08 district that Trump won only narrowly, but Democrats have reason to be optimistic here because former Representative Brad Ashford is running. He narrowly lost his seat last year, but any Democrat who could beat an incumbent in 2014 (as Ashford did) has the political skill to win in 2018. Already this is being rated as one of next year’s closest races, and if you live in Omaha I hope you’re used to political ads during Huskers games. At least those ads will be more entertaining than anything Mike Riley put on the field.</p> <h2> Florida’s Sixth Congressional District (Volusia County)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 40–Trump 57</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 47–Romney 52</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 50–McCain 49</i></p> <p> From 1992–2008 Democrats won Volusia County (home to Daytona Beach for all you spring breakers out there) in every presidential election even though they only carried Florida twice in that period. But since 2008 the county, home to a lot of Fox News-watching retirees, has turned sharply Republican, backing Trump 54-41. The Sixth contains all of Volusia and some surrounding, more Republican areas. </p> <p> Still, Democrats insist that the Sixth is up for grabs next year, as incumbent Ronald DeSantis is running for governor. He just announced his run <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-rep-ron-desantis-announces-run-for-governor-of-florida/\" target=\"_blank\">last week</a>, so the Republican field has yet to develop. But Democrats have already recruited a credible candidate in Nancy Soderberg. A former diplomat, in 2012 Soderberg lost a race for state senate in a district that voted nearly 2-1 for Mitt Romney, but she did perform better than Obama. It’ll be hard to reverse the trend toward Republicans here, but one issue that could help her is Trump’s recent order lifting restrictions on drilling off the Atlantic Coast. Nobody wants to hang out at Caribbean Jack’s if there’s an oil rig in the background.</p> <h2> Florida’s 18th Congressional District (Treasure Coast)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 44–Trump 53</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 48–Romney 51</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 51–McCain 48</i></p> <p> Representative Brian Mast <i> should </i>be in good position. His district is trending Republican and Mast, a Bronze Star winner who lost his legs in combat, has a good bio. But this being Florida, Mast has already been linked to a company <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/florida-mast-marketing-scandal-236103\" target=\"_blank\">caught up in an FTC investigation</a>. And Democrats have two credible candidates in Navy vet Pam Keith and former diplomat Lauren Baer. With Mast <a href=\"http://postonpolitics.blog.mypalmbeachpost.com/2017/12/21/dem-pollster-brian-mast-vulnerable-trump-and-tax-cut-unpopular/\" target=\"_blank\">only up 45-44 over a generic Democrat</a> the primary victor will have a good shot at making it to Congress. And that poll was taken before the the oil drilling announcement.</p> <h2> New York’s 11th Congressional District (Staten Island)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 44–Trump 54</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 52–Romney 47</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 48–McCain 51</i></p> <p> The 11th has the distinction of being the only district in America that voted for John McCain but not Mitt Romney. That’s most likely due to President Obama’s handling of Hurricane Sandy, which hit Staten Island and Southern Brooklyn (both in this district) hard. But as you can see, President Trump’s schtick plays well on Staten Island as well. (For those unfamiliar with the tristate area, Staten Island is home to most of our cops and Jersey Shore cast members.)</p> <p> The current congressman for Staten Island is Dan Donovan, also known as the prosecutor who let the cop who killed Eric Garner walk. Donovan won the seat in a 2015 special election after Michael Grimm, who pled guilty to tax fraud (and, in typical Staten Island fashion, threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony) resigned. Last year Donovan was re-elected with ease but he’s had to vote against measures like the AHCA and the tax bill because of the penalties they impose on New York City (he’s the only Republican representing part of it). <br> <br> This means Donovan has pissed off Steve Bannon, who recruited to run against him…..Grimm himself! Grimm’s insisting that he was a political prisoner and his candidacy could hobble Donovan, and not just in the primary. (Grimm has recently indicated he’s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvqqxw/who-stole-the-four-hour-workday-0000406-v21n8\" target=\"_blank\">backing away from Bannon</a> after the latter pissed off Trump.)</p> <p> New York has about seven different party lines for candidates to run on. Candidates run for multiple parties’ nominations and the parties are allowed to cross-endorse candidates. For example, in 2010 (when this area was in the 13th District) Grimm actually received fewer votes (55,822) than his opponent, former Democratic Representative Michael McMahon (56,412), on the major party lines. But Grimm got more votes (9,204) than McMahon (4,361) from the minor parties who cross-endorsed them (the Conservative Party for Grimm, the Independent Party for McMahon) and Grimm won the race. And Grimm <a href=\"http://www.silive.com/news/2017/08/with_gop_behind_donovan_grimm.html\" target=\"_blank\">appears to be gunning for the Conservative Party line this year</a>, which could cost Donovan in a close election even if he wins the Republican nomination.</p> <p> On the Democratic side there’s seven candidates running here, but the frontrunner appears to be veteran Max Rose. He has raised good money and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNEEFvPCTZ4\" target=\"_blank\">has the outerborough appeal down pat</a>. And thanks to Grimm’s run, he could become congressman with less than 50 percent of the vote.</p> <h2> New York’s 23rd Congressional District (Southern Tier)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 40–Trump 55</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 48–Romney 50</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 50–McCain 49</i></p> <p> The 23rd contains the college town of Ithaca (and surrounding Tompkins County) along with a slice of New York’s most Republican area: the Southern tier of counties along its border with Pennsylvania. In 2016 Hillary Clinton won Tompkins County 69-25, but it only comprises about 15 percent of the district’s votes. She lost the rest of it 35-60.</p> <p> So the district is an uphill climb for any Democrat, but winning here is not impossible. Tompkins County Legislator Nate Shinagawa held Representative Tom Reed under 50 percent when he ran here in 2012 but, like a lot of talented upstate New Yorkers, Shinagawa has since left the state for a better job. There are seven Democrats running to take on Reed this year, but none have really raised credible money or made many waves.</p> <p> So it’s time for left wing groups like Our Revolution and DSA to step up, as it’s hard to think of a district more ripe for a Berniecrat candidate than the 23rd. (Sanders won every county there in the New York primary.) The main voting base for the district is a college town, with the rest of the area being economically stagnant. Like most of Upstate New York it shifted sharply from Obama toward Trump. These are perfect conditions for a left-wing upstart campaign. So hopefully those groups can endorse (and direct donations to) one of the candidates already running or run one of Sanders’s delegates from the area.</p> <h2> Indiana’s Second Congressional District (North Central Indiana)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 36–Trump 59</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 42–Romney 56</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 50–McCain 49</i></p> <p> That 2016 presidential topline is brutal, but Democrats have reason for hope here. Senator Joe Donnelly used to hold this seat and no doubt his well-funded campaign will be working hard to turn out his old base, which is heavily Catholic (Notre Dame is in this district) and consists of many ersatz Democrats who vote Republican because they’re pro-life. The last time Donnelly ran for Senate the Democratic candidate for this seat only narrowly lost to now Representative Jackie Walorski. </p> <p> Now Democrats think they have a viable candidate in Mel Hall, a former healthcare executive. But he still has an uphill climb: Walorski, who in the state legislature earned the moniker Wacky Jackie from HuffPo, has won by more than 20 percent in each of her last re-election campaigns. Hall has some of the local party infrastructure backing him, but there are a couple of candidates running to his left because he’s talked about working with Trump. And, much like in New York’s 23rd, there’s a case to be made that a district consisting of a big college town and economically stagnant outlying areas that voted for Sanders in the primary is prime territory for a Berniecrat.</p> <h2> Ohio’s Tenth Congressional District (Dayton)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 44–Trump 51</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 48–Romney 50</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 49–McCain 49</i></p> <h2> Nevada’s Second Congressional District (The state outside Las Vegas)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 40–Trump 52</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 45–Romney 53</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 49–McCain 48</i></p> <h2> Washington’s Third Congressional District (Southwest Washington)</h2> <p> <i> 2016: Clinton 43–Trump 50</i><br> <i> 2012: Obama 48–Romney 50</i><br> <i> 2008: Obama 51–McCain 47</i></p> <p> I’m lumping these three districts together because nobody thinks Democrats have much of a shot in these seats today, but all three of their congressmen have been the subject of retirement rumors. Nevada Representative Mark Amodei has been the most up front about the ones surrounding him—he said he’ll decide if he’s running for re-election in March. Washington Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler’s been more coy but she’s the mother of a special needs child and that can be difficult when you have to fly cross-country for work. Ohio Representative Mike Turner hits the House retirement trifecta—poor fundraising, an ostensible moderate, and he’s going through a divorce—but he insists that he’s going to run for re-election. All of their seats would become immediately competitive if they retired, but for now Democrats aren’t paying too much attention here.</p> <p> We started our series in November and since then we’ve covered every GOP-held seat won by a Democratic presidential candidate in the last three cycles. And so much has happened since we started the series, next week we’re going to catch you up on recent developments in these competitive House seats.</p> <p><i> Robert Wheel (a pseudonym) is an attorney who lives in New York.

The teaser doesn't seem to give us a look at any actual footage from season two, but the minute-long clip perfectly captures <i>Atlanta</i>'s strange, beautiful, and surreal tone.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/RealTalkUPROXX/status/950213230735118337\" data-iframely-id=\"UMXEB4S\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/UMXEB4S?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>It's only fitting that FX decided to premiere the season two teaser during the 2018 Golden Globes since the first season of <i>Atlanta</i> took home a <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/820781/why-donald-glover-can-t-believe-atlanta-won-two-golden-globes\" target=\"_blank\">pair of awards at last year's ceremony</a>. But ultimately, the clip would be just as exciting if it was dumped on YouTube one day without any fanfare—it's just good to know we'll be getting more <i>Atlanta</i> soon.</p> <p>The first episode of season two, called <i>Atlanta: Robbin' Season</i>, drops March 1 and the show's creators have promised that the new season will have a more cohesive, season-long arc, Vulture <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/atlanta-season-two-robbin-season-how-it-got-its-name.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>, inspired by, uh, the 1992 cartoon <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlSdwrCcDXU\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Vacation</a></i>.</p> <p>&quot;<i>Tiny Toons Summer Vacation</i> was broken up into a bunch of episodes, but if you watched them all together they were a movie,&quot; co-creator Stephen Glover said at a panel last week. &quot;We took that idea. It’s a whole story, but told in a bunch of little parts.&quot;</p> <p>Sunday's new trailer doesn't exactly give off the <i>Tiny Toons</i> vibe, what with all the <a href=\"http://emptyeasel.com/2007/07/20/chiaroscuro-in-painting-the-power-of-light-and-dark/\" target=\"_blank\">chiaroscuro</a> and lack of talking animals, but maybe season two will end with Earn enrolling at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b1z5AvIuGQ\" target=\"_blank\">Acme Looniversity</a> or something. We'll have to wait until March to see. </p>",

        "content": "<p> For a ceremony that seemed prime to be celebrating breaking the culture of silence that enabled predators like Harvey Weinstein to get away with so much for so long, the 75th Golden Globe Awards were unusually silent. The red carpet started off hot, with<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmackau/status/950142065480028160\" target=\"_blank\"> Debra Messing calling out E!</a> for paying their female co-hosts less than their male co-hosts while being interviewed by E!, but the actual awards show was mostly unremarkable, if not outright disappointing.</p> <p> As host, Seth Meyers did about the best that he could, delivering a fairly tame opening monologue before essentially getting out of the way and letting the ceremony unfold. For the most part, presenters followed suit—with the exception of Geena Davis, who took a jab at the self-congratulatory attitude that awards shows can often take, sarcastically remarking, “I love that we fixed everything,” and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/THR/status/950208837805420545\" target=\"_blank\">Natalie Portman</a>, who called out the fact that all of the motion picture best director nominees were male. All of the following reaction shots were nothing if not awkward, though Guillermo del Toro’s win for <i> The Shape of Water</i> (which also garnered an award for Alexandre Desplat's score) felt well deserved, as he defied being played off the stage and sung the praises of monsters, imperfection, and other-ness.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/VICE/status/950213863751995393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-iframely-id=\"gJy4b5w\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/gJy4b5w?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p> Unsurprisingly, though, it was Oprah who gave the most electrifying speech of the night. Accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, she spoke of the effect of seeing Sidney Poitier win the Oscar for <i> Lilies of the Field</i>, noting that she had “never seen a black man being celebrated like that.” She also spoke about the lives of Recy Taylor and Rosa Parks, making what was possibly the night’s only cogent call to the #MeToo movement: “[Taylor] lived, as we all have lived, in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men, but their time is up.”</p> <p> But change doesn’t happen overnight, and the Globes are no exception to the rule. Gary Oldman, who <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/dracula-wife-split-horror-show-article-1.933283\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly assaulted</a> his ex-wife and gave an<a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/gary-oldman-blasts-liberal-hollywood-defends-mel-gibson-and-alec-baldwin-1201243936/\" target=\"_blank\"> unpleasant, racist, and anti-Semitic interview</a> to <i> Playboy</i>, took home the prize for Best Actor in a Drama for <i> Darkest Hour;</i> in the hours since James Franco’s win for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for <i> The Disaster Artist</i>, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/james-franco-golden-globes-ally-sheedy.html\" target=\"_blank\">multiple accusations</a> against him have begun cropping up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/audreyalison/status/950254414689808384\" target=\"_blank\">on social media</a>. Then there’s the fact that Kirk Douglas, who's in the past faced allegations of <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5893793/did-robert-downey-jr-really-just-accuse-kirk-douglas-of-a-brutal-rape\" target=\"_blank\">rape against actress Natalie Wood</a>, was one of the presenters for Best Screenplay (won by Martin McDonagh for <i> Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</i>) and received a standing ovation from the gathered crowd.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/VICE/status/950211851786313729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-iframely-id=\"Pdg2wWk\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/Pdg2wWk?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p> It all seems like a cosmic stroke of irony given that <i> Big Little Lies</i>—a series about women banding together against an abusive man—took home four awards, winning Best Miniseries or Television Film, with Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern, and Alexander Skarsgård winning in their respective acting categories. Of the four speeches, Dern’s was easily the best, as she called for the promotion of restorative justice as well as calling out the toxicity of a culture that would silence victims and prevent them from speaking up.</p> <p> It was also strange to see that <i> Lady Bird</i>, which won Best Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy (Saoirse Ronan), hadn’t garnered a Best Director nomination for Greta Gerwig, given the film’s other nominations. Even Barbra Streisand pointed out the metaphorical gap, noting that she's still the only woman to have won the Golden Globe for Best Director (for <i> Yentl</i> in 1984). </p><p>That sense of inequity persisted throughout the night, as most of the speeches made by men veered away from being remotely political—take Ewan McGregor’s acceptance speech for <i> Fargo</i>, for instance, or Sam Rockwell’s for <i> Three Billboards</i>—and <i> The Greatest Showman</i>, a facile offense in a progressive work’s clothing, took home the prize for Best Original Song. Even the acceptance speeches for <i> Coco</i>, which won for Best Animated Feature, and <i> In the Fade</i>, for Best Foreign Language Film, were fairly pedestrian.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/VICE/status/950208980906856454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-iframely-id=\"PsHMG3U\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/PsHMG3U?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p> Still, HFPA President Meher Tatna’s speech on the importance of journalism (and the announcement of two grants to fund and protect investigative journalists) was heartening, even more so as stories about women and diversity began to carry the day. <i> The Handmaid’s Tale</i> won for Best Actress in a TV Drama (Elizabeth Moss) as well as Best TV Drama, and <i> The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i> won the equivalent awards for TV Musical or Comedy (with Rachel Brosnahan winning for her performance as Mrs. Maisel herself). Allison Janney, with <i> I, Tonya</i>’s sole win, noted the movie’s message about class, as well as shouting out the real Tonya Harding, who was in attendance at the ceremony.</p> <p> There were a few firsts over the course of the night, too. Aziz Ansari made history as the first Asian actor to win the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a TV Musical or Comedy, and Sterling K. Brown became the first black man to win the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a TV Drama. Sterling’s speech, in which he spoke about the importance of his role as having been written for him, and thereby allowing him to be seen, was particularly resonant in a room—and among nominations—that were predominantly white.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/VICE/status/950198013116469248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-iframely-id=\"vsBFP65\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/vsBFP65?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p> It feels like a relevant point for a ceremony in which <i> Three Billboards</i> dominated, winning in four out of the six categories it was nominated in, with Frances McDormand’s acting win and the prize for Best Drama rounding out its recognitions. The film is great in some regards and weak in others, specifically in its handling of race, which is a sticking point that has been—but should not be— overlooked in the struggle towards intersectional feminism and intersectionality as a whole. <i> Get Out</i>, for instance, was shut out despite being one of the best films of last year, as was <i> Call Me By Your Name</i>.</p> <p>Oprah aside, this year’s Golden Globes were underwhelming, with most people still afraid to address the elephant in the room, and hypocrisy extended to some of the honors bestowed and the Time’s Up pin worn by artists who have collaborated with Woody Allen and Roman Polanski. But the show wasn’t entirely disappointing. People <i> are</i> speaking out, and the world has become all more eager to listen. </p>",

        "content": "<p>Keef smoking originated in North Africa and the Middle East. In the Rif region of Morocco, for instance, people have been smoking it for hundreds of years. Derived from the Arabic word <i>kayf</i>, which means “pleasure,” it is sometimes written in English as <i>kif</i> or <i>kief. </i>All of these terms refer to the sticky THC crystals that make your buds look frosty AF. Apparently, keef has been a big thing with Western stoners for quite awhile, too. Look no further than T.W. Coakley’s semi-autobiographical novel, <i><a href=\"http://feralhouse.com/keef/\" target=\"_blank\">Keef: A Story of Intoxication, Love &amp; Death</a>. </i>The book chronicles the New England author’s experiences smoking the stuff to attain “keef wisdom” back in 1897. </p> <p>Drawing comparisons to Edgar Allen Poe’s work for its supernatural flair, the book was listed as one of the most important publishing events in that year's edition of <i> Appleton’s Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events</i>. (Other novels that made the list include H.G. Wells’s <i>The Invisible Man</i> and Rudyard Kipling’s<i> Captain Courageous</i>.) Had it been lost to time, we might not know that people once saw keef as both a “wonder-working-weed” with the power to accelerate the cognitive processes and a “witching drug” that could be used to search for a love that transcended even death. </p><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515188462442-KEEF-Title-Page-Color-078-FINAL.jpeg\"></picture><div></div></div><p>Thankfully, <i> Keef</i> was re-released by Process Media in 2017 through a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.realkidshades.com/rks-library.html\" target=\"_blank\">RKS Library</a>, which houses the second largest collection of drug lit in the world.

Gertz: </b>Born in Cambridge, MA in 1865 and trained as an artist, Coakley studied the law and was admitted to the bar in 1886, but very soon devoted himself to writing full-time as a newspaper and magazine journalist. <i> Keef</i> was Coakley’s first and only novel, inspired, it appears, by his attraction to the oriental-themed paintings of Benjamin Constant and Rudolph Ernst. Which were, in turn, inspired by those painters’ travels to Morocco.</p> <p><b> Why did he write and publish </b><b> <i> Keef</i></b><b>?</b><br> Much of the story takes place in New York, where Coakley had lived and worked for years. It was during this period that real hashish houses and Turkish smoking parlors were popular. They had been attracting crowds of customers since the early 1880s. It is highly probable that Coakley either visited such an establishment for research purposes, or enjoyed a visit as a patron.</p> <p>The original publisher announced the book thusly: &quot;Charles E. Brown &amp; Co. have just issued a romance entitled <i>Keef: A Life Story in Nine Phases</i>, by Timothy Wilfred Coakley, of the Boston Bar. It is the story of a Jewish painter, who in search for higher inspiration finds that the Oriental herb gives him the exaltation for which he is pining. The form of a beautiful woman at last appears before his vision. And the story tells how he finds the original of his ideal and how her life is associated with his. It is cleverly written. Curiously enough, just about as the book was put on the market, Mr. Coakley was called upon to give professional advice to a client who bore the name of Keefe.”</p> <div><picture><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg?resize=900:*\" media=\"(min-width: 53.125em)\"><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189233464-Smoking-the-Hookah-by-Rudolf-Ernst-1885.jpeg\"></picture><div><i>Smoking the Hookah</i> by Rudolf Ernst, 1885</div></div><p><b> What is the concept behind “keef wisdom” and how does one attain it?</b><br> As Dr. Siegal notes in the preface,&quot;Cannabis wisdom involves some consumption of cannabis itself, usually keef, never forbidden in the Islamic moral codes. It draws heavily on memories, themes, and everyday conversations derived from being under the influence. The storyteller must then weave such experiences with characters, settings, and plots that create meaning in a world which might otherwise reject the significance of keef or other cannabis preparations. The best illustrations of this wisdom are found in the keef literature discussed in the introduction. The novel by T.W. Coakley was the first in this genre, appearing in the century before the work of other writers like Paul Bowles and Jean Genet.&quot;</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/bong-appetit-kief-cherry-chocolate-ice-cream-with-cannabis-crumble/59e7ca13177dd4329a770cc1\" data-iframely-id=\"w4sidIS\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/w4sidIS\"></iframe></div></div> <p><b> How did a book about smoking keef get compared to Edgar Allen Poe?</b><br> <i>Keef</i>’s often eerie spiritual dimension is definitely inspired by Poe. Coakley was born 16 years after Poe’s death and, as Dr. Siegal notes, it’s as if Coakley discovered an unpublished manuscript by E.A.P. <i>Keef</i> is simply a masterful imitation of Poe's style. It’s both writers’ exploration of the inner landscape of the human mind that draws favorable comparisons. Ultimately, however, readers will have to decide, which should be a pleasant decision to make indeed. </p><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189361641-Riding-A-Flying-Carpet-by-Viktor-Vasnetsov-1880.jpeg\"></picture><div><i>Riding a Flying Carpet</i> by Viktor Vasnetsov, 1880</div></div> <p><b> Hookahs, flying carpets, and Arabia—keef has a lot of wild images associated with it. Can you explain?</b><br> Chalk it up to Oriental Romanticism, the West's fascination with the exotic mysteries of the East, which began in the late 18th century and took off during the 19th. Female sexuality played a role; the erotic was never far in the background. It provided subtext—those mysteriously alluring and tempting women behind veils. Oriental Romanticism was, obviously, a wishful and gross distortion of reality and remains a bane to true understanding of Eastern cultures.</p> <p><b> Do you think it’s safe to say that drugs have always been a part of the human experience?</b><br> Yes. Dr. Siegel’s research has firmly established that mammals are attracted to plants that will alter consciousness. Little children spinning in circles to make themselves drunk-like dizzy is an example of humans deliberately altering their mental state to enjoy the results. It begins at a young age.</p> <div><picture><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515189581627-Original-1897-cover-of-Keef-by-TW-Coakley.jpeg\"></picture><div>The original, 1897 cover of <i>Keef</i> by T.W. Coakley</div></div><p><b> Why?</b> <br> The drive to alter consciousness represents a human instinct beyond sex, hunger, and sleep. It is, I believe, the drive to transcend quotidian reality. Transcendence can be achieved via religion or any activity that takes the individual out of their sense of temporal existence. Any activity that promotes flow, the ability to get lost in your head and/or in what you’re doing and lose all sense of time and ego, can lead to transcendence.</p> <p><b> What was it like working with Dr. Siegal putting together the RKS Library?</b><br> Dr. Siegal’s joy in discovering lost books is contagious. He’s like a little kid with a new toy. He cannot leave it alone. And he needs to know everything that can be known. He’ll often call or write with some new tidbit he’s unearthed. It’s fun to play in the literary sandbox with him.</p> <p><b> What can modern marijuana smokers learn from this book?</b><br> That today you can buy cannabis at your local dispensary with an equal or higher THC count than keef, but you will not experience the enticing visions associated with keef in literature. Mindset and physical setting highly influence how a psychotropic drug will be experienced, and the user’s native culture will provide context. You may have waking dreams but, rather than being rapturously transported to an exotic world featuring veiled and alluring women of the East during an ecstatic hallucination, you’re more likely to keep keef-inspired company with barmaids from Hooters imagined within curls of smoke, perhaps crave a Snickers candy bar, and/or simply zone-out in front of the TV watching reruns of <i>Lost in Space</i>.</p><p><i> Follow Seth Ferranti on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matthewt_ny\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

The main advertisements for these movies are photos of that sticky moment. And many of the loads appear so massive they seem unreal. That's because they are.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/qkbwd5/an-oral-history-of-the-moneyshot?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=wjpzdb&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>Since the magazine era, photographers have used “fake cum” to create artificial pop shots or bulk out real loads, so they can play with them for the ideal image. It’s just more reliable than counting on male talent to give you the right amount and placement, and means a producer can shoot promo cum shot stills before or after the actual scene. Some fans may view this as a betrayal, muses performer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexisfawx?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Alexis Fawx</a>, lessening the authenticity of a shot, misrepresenting advertised scenes, or otherwise mucking with the integrity of a fantasy. But within the industry, fake cum photos are just a given. It’s “nothing I think twice about when it’s time to ‘squirt me with <i> semen</i>,’” says star <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lilylanexxx?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Lily Lane</a>.</p> <p>Fake loads are also used in filmed scenes. A director might use movie magic (or a <a href=\"https://www.simplipleasure.com/blogs/dildo-buying-guides/ejaculating-dildos-buying-guide\" target=\"_blank\">realistic dildo with a pump inside</a>) to make it look like a male performer is actually cumming gobs of fake jizz if he just can’t cum—insurance for the money shot. Similar tactics come into play for creampie and cum play fetish films, or played with by stars in real time on livestreams.</p> <p>Beyond the adult industry, <a href=\"https://www.lushstories.com/forum/yaf_postsm1604784_Fake-Cum.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">cumplay fetishists</a> seek fake cum for personal use. People who want to ejaculate but can’t—individuals with vaginas who like to fuck others with dildos or people with penises who suffer from erectile dysfunction issues—buy fake cum as well. And of course there’s always a limited market for fake cum for <a href=\"http://howtorevenge.com/articles/make-fake-semen/\" target=\"_blank\">pranks</a>, <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/6vg58m/the-j-pop-world-why-one-anti-idol-group-is-covering-themselves-in-fake-semen-akb48-dis-2014-57a20789ce6c3edef347e6a8\" target=\"_blank\">stunts</a>, and risqué mainstream movies. “I used to be the art director for a horror production company,” says adult performer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glassolive/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Olive Glass</a>. “We had to use fake blood and semen all the time.” </p> <p>All of which is to say: fake cum is everywhere, if you actually know where to look. Its popularity is on the rise, too, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susannahbreslin/2017/08/31/sex-toy-reviews/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">says Sherri Shaulis</a>, a sex product editor at <i> Adult Video News</i>. </p><div data-embed-id=\"1515174201846\"><iframe width=\"560\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/embed/565ca5cb15d0aae653606acf\" height=\"315\"></iframe></div> <p>Those interested in using fake cum have options that range from professional grade to DIY. <a href=\"http://howtorevenge.com/articles/make-fake-semen/\" target=\"_blank\">According to common</a> <a href=\"http://www.ranker.com/list/things-used-as-nasty-substances-in-movies/nathan-gibson\" target=\"_blank\">internet lore</a>, most fake cum is methyl cellulose, a goopy gel used in old school K-Y Jelly lube, some cosmetics, and countless sci-fi and horror films as slime or spit. But just about every adult performer I’ve asked tells me they use the face cleanser Cetaphil. </p><p>It “looks just like cum,” says woodman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnnysins?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Johnny Sins</a>. &quot;But doesn’t taste that great.” As such, on the occasion porn stars have to have “cum” in their mouths for a long time, some studios use piña colada mix instead.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/9ad5k8/we-asked-a-male-porn-star-how-to-jizz-good?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=wjpzdb&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>However it’s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3ydyq/most-vagina-tightening-products-are-bullshit\" target=\"_blank\">never a great idea</a> to put soap or food products <i> inside </i>a vagina. So for internal fake cum work, there are lubes augmented to look more like cum, like <a href=\"https://medium.com/@beyondexquisites/involve-into-the-imaginary-sexual-world-via-fake-cum-lube-1ca70fa316e0\" target=\"_blank\">Cum Lube</a> and <a href=\"http://forced-womanhood.com/favorite-recipes-for-fake-cum/\" target=\"_blank\">Spunk</a>. Max Huhn's company <a href=\"http://magicmoneyshot.com/how-to-make-fake-cum/\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Money Shot</a> mass-produces a substance called “Kum.” He argues it's the most convincing fake cum. He thinks most lubes don’t do a great job of replicating cum because they have to focus too much on being, well, lube: something you can use safely in penetrative sex. He argues his product, which he will only say is the result of significant trial and error, is the closest one can get to a realistic cum shot—and something that’s definitely OK to get in a performer’s mouth. The company also sells an “authentic” version made to <i>taste</i> like actual semen.</p> <p>Huhn says Kum sells, and half of its buyers are individuals. Which makes sense, as its focus on look and taste would appeal to cumplay fetishists on the hunt for something safe and convincing in an interactive context. </p> <p>For those looking to make their own fake cum, there are an almost infinite number of DIY recipes out there. (A couple performers told me about directors and photographers resorting to DIY recipes when they had no Cetaphil on hand, and needed to shoot something <i> now.) </i>Prank site <a href=\"http://howtorevenge.com/articles/make-fake-semen/\" target=\"_blank\"><i> How to Revenge</i></a> lists one using egg whites, plain yogurt, water, cornstarch, and just a pinch of salt. <a href=\"http://forced-womanhood.com/favorite-recipes-for-fake-cum/\" target=\"_blank\">Adult forums</a> <a href=\"https://www.lushstories.com/forum/yaf_postsm1604784_Fake-Cum.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">include other</a> <a href=\"https://www.stripperweb.com/forum/showthread.php?168951-secret-fake-sperm-recipes-anyone\" target=\"_blank\">egg or yogurt-based recipes</a>. Some call for French vanilla creamer, coconut milk, or kitten milk replacement formula. <a href=\"http://www.cuckoldplace.com/31_40529_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">On the web</a>, <a href=\"http://magicmoneyshot.com/how-to-make-fake-cum/\" target=\"_blank\">you can also find recipes</a> using shampoo, lotions, body wash, flour, baby powder, condensed milk, or just about anything else white or gooey in a grocery store.</p> <p>But these DIY recipes all come with risks, depending on how they’re used. Any food product or cosmetic could cause serious issues if used in a sensitive place like eyes or, say, vaginas. And some of them just aren’t—according to forums and porn stars alike—very convincing to begin with.</p> <p>Whatever your bag or desire, there's likely a fake cum product or recipe for you. We truly do live in an amazing era. And a sticky one. </p><p><i>Follow Mark Hay on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goraladka?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><i> Welcome back to Can't Handle the Truth, our Saturday column looking at the past seven days of fake news and hoaxes that have spread thanks to the internet.</i> </p> <p>Ever since fake news became America's boogeyman in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.ddAb9XAPR#.vmgEe6wYk\" target=\"_blank\">about the middle of November, 2016</a>, academia has been trying document and quantify the causes and effects of the phenomenon. This week, a trio of political scientists <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">published an analysis</a> of news-consuming habits of voters in 2016. Some results were what you'd expect: &quot;Almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10% of Americans with the most conservative information diets.&quot;</p> <p>One unusual observation in the study, though, is that &quot;visits to fake news websites are highest among people who consume the most hard news and do not measurably decrease among the most politically knowledgeable individuals.&quot; In other words, whether you're a right- or left-winger, fake news is mostly consumed by voracious news junkies, and—perhaps more importantly—as just a small part of a balanced news diet with much healthier elements. Maybe that's why the <i> New York Times </i>ran a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/health/fake-news-conservative-liberal.html?smid=tw-nytnational&smtyp=cur\" target=\"_blank\">headline</a> about the study acknowledged that fake news was widely consumed but had &quot;little impact.&quot; That, however, is a pretty dubious takeaway. </p> <p>If you're just talking about the 2016 election, it's possible to minimize the effects of fake news. But just look around and it's obvious something is seriously wrong: Flat Earthers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16424622/reddit-conspiracy-theories-memes-irony-flat-earth\" target=\"_blank\">seemed to be gaining momentum</a> all last year, despite the earth being round. <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8085816/teigen-legend-pizzagate-conspiracy-timeline\" target=\"_blank\">The Pizzagate crowd</a> keeps finding new and exciting ways to harass public figures. There may not be an obvious causal thread between those phenomena to garbage fake news websites like <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.online/\" target=\"_blank\">The Last Line of Defense</a>, which are the focus of the study, but that doesn't mean that they aren't related.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvwkmv/the-ten-most-toxic-pieces-of-fake-news-in-2017\" target=\"_blank\">Like I said last week</a>, the widespread existence of lies that flatter people's partisan beliefs seems to be a symptom of some larger problem (or constellation of problems) in the US. I wish I could be reassured by that study, but I'm not. </p> <p>Anyway, here are some of this week's lies:</p> <h2> <strike>Chocolate is on the brink of extinction</strike> </h2> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/when-chocolate-extinct-2017-12\" target=\"_blank\">an article this week from Business Insider</a>, &quot;Chocolate is on track to go extinct in 40 years.&quot; The story was viral dynamite (as was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/11/15/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-maker-says-were-running-out-of-chocolate/?utm_term=.a2db87ba77a7\" target=\"_blank\">a similar story</a> in the <i>Washington Post</i> three years ago), because chocolate is one of those foods like bacon that people feign an obsession with in order to seem funny or interesting. Fortunately, the Cathys of the world can reserve their outbursts of &quot;Ack!&quot; for scarier news. Chocolate is most likely here to stay.</p> <p>In short, the piece is overstating the perils of climate change. It cites <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-and-chocolate/\" target=\"_blank\">real</a> (and totally scary) stories from a few years ago about tropical diseases that attack cacao and the ways that climate change is <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-chocolate\" target=\"_blank\">reducing</a> the amount of land on which the crop can be cultivated. It's really just the headline misses the mark, and sometimes that's all that matters since people don't tend to read entire articles, or even click through to the actual story. </p> <hr> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/who-was-the-internets-biggest-villain-in-2017/5a3d4f01177dd4223c6a9713?latest=1\" data-iframely-id=\"28dCVRI\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/28dCVRI\"></iframe></div></div> <p>Cacao farmers do face climate change–related challenges, and as Business Insider noted, scientists are working with chocolate companies to overcome these difficulties. But as the 2014 <i> Post</i> piece about this problem noted, the problem is largely one of too much demand. &quot;By 2020, the two chocolate-makers warn that [chocolate consumption] could swell to 1 million metric tons, a more than 14-fold increase; by 2030, they think the deficit could reach 2 million metric tons.&quot; While this brings to light serious questions about the long-term availability of cheap chocolate, there's absolutely no evidence anywhere to suggest that the world will actually run out of chocolate. </p> <h2><strike>Trump craves televised gorilla fights</strike></h2> <p>&quot;The Gorilla Channel&quot; is the latest creation from Pixelated Boat, a popular Twitter account probably best known for the <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/milkshake-duck\" target=\"_blank\">Milkshake Duck</a> meme. Boat created this fake book except on Thursday, and it's now a widespread (and probably permanent) Twitter meme. Here's the tweet:</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/pixelatedboat/status/949100087350710272\" data-iframely-id=\"EEC6EO9\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/EEC6EO9?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>Imagine! A whole channel of nothing but gorillas, and just for the president! Actually, thanks to my VICE News colleagues, you don't have to imagine it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAfiAUTDCW0\" target=\"_blank\">It literally already exists now</a>.</p> <p>Obvious Twitter jokes that get mistaken for the truth can get you suspended, as happened with VICE contributor Krang T. Nelson, when that user <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evbpkn/twitter-suspended-me-for-trolling-white-supremacists\" target=\"_blank\">pretended to be a violent leftist</a> in the process of overthrowing the government. But as Boat has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixelatedboat/status/949399641203748865\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledged</a>, this is a somewhat lower-stakes joke format—it was around at least as <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wd4bgz/i-accidentally-fooled-conservative-twitter-with-a-fake-lena-dunham-quote-106\" target=\"_blank\">far back as 2014</a>, when writer and VICE contributor Kaleb Horton tweeted out a fake excerpt from Lena Dunham's book and right-wing Twitter users believed it was real. </p> <p>The steps involved are all very familiar by now: 1) Come out on social media with some revelation so unbelievably silly that, come on, no <i>reasonable</i> person could ever possibly believe it, no way, not in a million years. 2) Have a good number of fans who read your posts and totally &quot;get&quot; you. 3) Have those fans distribute the hilarity to their followers (who, sadly, might not &quot;get&quot; you). 4) Some of those second-tier recipients of the joke<i>—</i>like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/949343808298278913\" target=\"_blank\">Farhad Manjoo from the<i> New York Times</i></a>—will be confused because the post is getting a lot of shares, including some from people who think it's real. 5) Jackpot: the dum-dums believe your obvious joke and lose their shit. 6) LOL.</p> <p>Some laugh. Others have their confused brains filled with still more internet bullshit. Is the world better because we dance this eternal dance? I leave that question to you, dear reader.</p> <h2> <strike>Trump doesn't know who John Boehner is</strike> </h2> <p>Pixelated Boat's fake excerpt was ostensibly pulled from the brand new Trump administration tell-all, <i><a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/fireandfury/michaelwolff/9781250158079/\" target=\"_blank\">Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</a>,</i> by Michael Wolff. The book is full what appear to be candid opinions from insiders about the competence—or lack thereof—of the commander in chief. The revelations in <i>Fire and Fury</i>, which was published on Friday, were a big deal even before physical copies were in stores. Promotional excerpts were so incendiary that by the middle of the week, they'd already <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3n788/steve-bannon-is-less-important-than-ever\" target=\"_blank\">driven a wedge</a> between Donald Trump and former White House advisor Steve Bannon.</p> <p>Already, many journalists have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/media/michael-wolff-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a> mistakes in the book, some of them the obvious sorts of things any competent fact-checker would have flagged. And that was just after combing through the sections that had already been published ahead of the book's release. In one obvious example, Wolff claimed that Trump said he didn't know who former House Speaker John Boehner was—but Trump has golfed with Boehner. At least one source for Wolff's book <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/948570026902196225\" target=\"_blank\">has denied saying what Wolff reported he said</a>. </p> <p>Then again, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-exec-phil-schiller-denies-unflattering-story-from-book-the-one-device-2017-6\" target=\"_blank\">people</a> <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/5972269/torii-hunter-says-homosexuality-is-not-right-then-claims-he-was-misquoted\" target=\"_blank\">often</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/richard-sherman-claims-he-was-misquoted-newspaper-responds/\" target=\"_blank\">claim</a> <a href=\"https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/09/tom-hardy-denies-gay-rumors-claims-was-misquoted/\" target=\"_blank\">they've</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/michael-sams-dad-claims-he-was-terribly-misquoted-by-ny-times/\" target=\"_blank\">been</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/fa-dave-whelan-misquoted-jewish-people-ban\" target=\"_blank\">misquoted</a> when the public reacts strongly to something they've apparently said. Wolff himself says the quotes in the book from major bigshots (like the president) will be backed up by <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-steve-bannon-michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-audio-recording-770431\" target=\"_blank\">audio recordings</a>. Also, nonfiction books—including really important ones like the <a href=\"http://supp.apa.org/style/pubman-reprint-corrections-for-2e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</a>—sometimes go to press with errors that have to be corrected in later editions. </p> <p>Trump and his allies would have called the book &quot;fake news&quot; regardless of its accuracy. And its worth noting that the book's broader thesis about an unprepared president who isn't trusted by his own staff is a story some of the most plugged-in people in DC <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/the-wolff-lines-on-trump-that-ring-unambiguously-true-2522675021.html\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledge as true</a>. At the same time, small but obvious mistakes in a work of journalism can lead people to distrust the larger conclusions. The book is clearly not 100 percent wrong, but in this case it seems hard to figure out which parts to take seriously but not literally.</p> <p><i>Follow Mike Pearl on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mikeleepearl\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i> </p>",

        "content": "<p>The other night, a stranger with an ambiguous-looking avatar and a private account DMed me on Instagram to tell me he was gay. He then asked how I reconcile my homosexuality with being Muslim (he'd likely just seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6jvoU0zFis\" target=\"_blank\">a video</a> about my relationship with my Muslim father.)</p> <p>It was late and I was sick; I didn’t want to respond. But I make a point to when the message is about coming out, which I’ve <a href=\"http://www.papermag.com/coming-out-is-hard-even-when-its-not-2445116271.html\" target=\"_blank\">written</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/khalid-el-khatib/in-defense-of-waiting-to-_b_1429939.html\" target=\"_blank\">about</a> often, and I wanted to tell him that despite having a Muslim father, I've never identified as Muslim. We went back and forth briefly until I politely declined coffee, and suggested that finding someone in his life to talk to would be more fulfilling than a stranger on the Internet. I wished him luck and signed off, “Congrats, being gay is great.”<br></p> <p>I have conversations like that on Twitter or Instagram almost weekly, but I have just a couple thousand followers on each. Meaning the inbox of a successful Instagay—the burgeoning cult of beautiful gay men on Instagram, with follower counts that reach into five or six digits—must be inundated.</p> <p>Chances are, if you’re a gay man, you either follow or have encountered an Instagay online. They’re “different than your average hot selfie-taking guy or women on Instagram,” as <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2013/07/instastuds-hot-gay-men-on-perma-display.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <i> New York Magazine</i> </a> once put it. “These men are more relentless and artful [...] their images as well-selected, aspirational, and powerfully seductive as an underwear or fragrance ad campaign.”</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Instagay phenomenon is often criticized for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinpokeeffe/status/935251327805825024\" target=\"_blank\">being vapid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newnownext.com/la-basics-instagram-gay-instagay-ken-doll/09/2017/\" target=\"_blank\">misrepresenting modern gay life</a>. It seems like many Instagays <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/6V63TIOquE/?taken-by=bennyptweets\" target=\"_blank\">know</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKynE5cDku_\" target=\"_blank\">each</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG0XJ3ALWUy/\" target=\"_blank\">other</a>, and so their world is unique. Through <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKMKhMJjQEI/?taken-by=kylekrieger\" target=\"_blank\">travelogues</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BX8lo9ag0PE/?taken-by=travisbryantnyc\" target=\"_blank\">lavish grooming routines,</a> and daily appearances at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZU4aOlHTfy/?taken-by=mattbishop.nyc\" target=\"_blank\">Barry’s Bootcamp</a>, one imagines endless disposable income (seemingly without real work to produce it).</p> <p>Despite some ridicule, there’s no shortage of Instagays who have crossed the elusive 500,000 follower mark, from writer/director <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxisms/\" target=\"_blank\">Max Emerson</a> to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/justinickpgh/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin and Nick</a>, a gay couple based in Pittsburgh. Ask a gay man to close his eyes and picture one, and he might see <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laurent.xiv/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Charles-Laurent Marchand</a>, a 26-year-old former runway model studying to be a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BX8v7gwBkaA/?hl=en&taken-by=laurent.xiv\" target=\"_blank\">pastry chef</a>. Followers travel the world alongside him, often in first class; in one story, he stripped down to Versace briefs in a lie-flat bet. He <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BaCmekfBkEt/?hl=en&taken-by=laurent.xiv\" target=\"_blank\">broke 400,000 followers</a> last October.</p> <p>And not unlike his peers, brands familiar to any Instagay follower are peppered throughout Charles’ feed, from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb5Iz1Xh1hX/?hl=en&taken-by=laurent.xiv\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Wellington watches</a> to the dating app <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ_vWhThMBK/\" target=\"_blank\">Chappy</a>. Many, unsurprisingly, are sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZq2LKahn2u/?hl=en&taken-by=lucas.bloms\" target=\"_blank\">protein powders</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVDF18yD6Ds/?hl=en&taken-by=jayetothekaye\" target=\"_blank\">teeth whiteners</a>. A recent <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/digital/what-is-the-real-cost-of-instagram-influence-infographics/#/\" target=\"_blank\"> <i> Ad Week</i> piece</a> noted Instagram influencers with 100,000 followers can earn nearly $800 per post—ample incentive to keep those underwear pics coming.</p> <p>Over the past few years, these men have captured a not-insignificant slice of the popular queer imagination. And while gay culture has always slavishly worshipped unrealistic ideas of beauty, from <a href=\"http://bilerico.lgbtqnation.com/2011/02/a_short_history_of_physique_magazines.php\" target=\"_blank\">physique model magazines</a> and the cult of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkq3q5/tom-of-finlands-art-still-resonates-because-it-mixes-pride-and-shame\" target=\"_blank\">Tom of Finland</a>, Instagay culture may take this worship to a new level.</p> <p>After all, Instagays are algorithmically-calibrated thirst traps, a new kind of social media star whose fame is predicated on a heady combination of sculpted abs and the lavish trappings of “influencer” culture. What if these are our new gay icons? And what happens when a new queer generation looks to them as role models and idols, people whose lives are their proof that it gets (much, much) better? Is the superficiality of Instagay culture really something they should look up to? How many of them are reaching out to Instagays for help through dark times, as they do to me? And how many of them have nowhere else to turn?</p> <p>I sought to ask the Instagays directly. And if you’re looking for Instagays, there’s one surefire way to find them: On New York-based artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnmacconnell/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">John MacConnell’s page</a>, where he’s sketched hundreds of men, most of whom are Instagays, in their underwear or less.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb-ek1eFRfY/?taken-by=johnmacconnell\" data-iframely-id=\"kjrL0GX\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/kjrL0GX?summary=true&amp;app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>After DMing John, 33, to talk about his experience, he invited me over to his Nolita apartment. By the time I climbed six flights to reach him, I had sweat through my white dress shirt, and no filter could glamorize me—I was the opposite of an Instagay. Nonetheless, he sketched me while I interviewed him, flicking on a spotlight and directing me towards a stool.</p> <p>“It’s so hot,” I said as I fanned myself with my notebook.</p> <p>“You could take some clothes off,” he smirked as he threw his sketchbook open.</p> <p>I fixated on how I sat while John drew me, and I asked if his other subjects did, too. He quickly painted a picture of his most-followed models as illusionists. “They know their angles, they know exactly how to twist at the waist,” he said. Yet their conversations often betray insecurities lurking beneath. “The people who work out the hardest often are because they’re self-conscious,” he said. “And I don’t get the best drawing from the people with the best bodies, either.”</p> <p>Still, it’s hard to find someone with a bad body on his feed. I ask if he thinks his work contributes to <a href=\"https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/yppgej/how-coming-out-and-hating-your-body-are-linked\" target=\"_blank\">body dysmorphia in the gay community</a>. His answer almost sounds media trained. “I’m drawing what I want to draw and people are choosing whether they want to consume it. I can’t speak to how they experience my work,” he replied. “People are selective about what they see.” He’s not defensive, but I realize I’ve put him in an unfair position. He’s an artist, this is his art, and the role—if any—that Instagays play in body dysmorphia within our community is almost impossible to parse.</p> <p>He’s more comfortable talking about the good he’s seen from Instagram. He told me it’s elevated his profile as an artist, that he’s used it to sell countless works of art, make friends and raise thousands for charity.</p> <p>After our interview, he shows me his sketch. I don’t think it looks much like me, no better, no worse—more angular, maybe. I wonder if I was too distracting with my questions or if John’s ballpoint pen often acts as a chisel.</p> <div> <div> <div><div><div><div><picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515096489345-image1-3.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515096489345-image1-3.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515096489345-image1-3.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515096489345-image1-3.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515096489345-image1-3.jpeg?resize=749:*\" media=\"(min-width: 40.625em)\"> <img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515096489345-image1-3.jpeg\"> </picture></div></div></div></div> </div> </div> <div> <div></div> </div> <p>The next night, I met <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brogan_nyc/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Logan Fletcher</a>, 26, for drinks in Hell’s Kitchen. He’s a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbda3nRlgz4/?hl=en&taken-by=johnmacconnell\" target=\"_blank\">frequent</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bap2QYBl2aF/?hl=en&taken-by=johnmacconnell\" target=\"_blank\">subject</a> of John’s sketches; with 30,000 followers, he’s still building his base. His sponsored posts are infrequent and most often for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BapvlbhB4p3/?hl=en&taken-by=brogan_nyc\" target=\"_blank\">The Underwear Expert</a>, an “underwear of the month” club. “I just get free underwear,” he told me.</p> <p>He looks like a Disney prince, blonde and tall; he brings up the fact that he’s 6’2” several times throughout our conversation, even when it’s irrelevant. And his personality matches his looks: he’s charming and refreshingly authentic, and over the course of a couple hours, he talks about everything from his ex to his obsession with drag queens.</p> <p>He’s transparent enough to show me his DMs. They’re mostly compliments, and they’re pretty benign, though he does get messages from guys struggling to come out. And he responds.</p> <p>He talks about his upbringing, and I’m surprised to learn he spent high school in gay conversion therapy, twice a week for three years. “I’ve been that kid in Middle America who had no one to talk to,” he said. “When I came out, my family took my phone and computer away so I couldn’t connect with other gay people. I’ve been that kid who feels like there’s nowhere to go, who looked to self-harm as a solution. I would hate for someone to feel like no one cared.” And he’s smart about how he replies. “I’m always very clear that I’m not a professional, and I might not have solid advice. I try to send them to other resources or organizations where I can.”</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbmzxBjBhT6/?taken-by=brogan_nyc\" data-iframely-id=\"cyFiz6K\"></div><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbmzxBjBhT6/?taken-by=brogan_nyc\" data-iframely-id=\"cyFiz6K\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/cyFiz6K?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As we keep talking, I push back a little—his Instagram doesn’t talk much about where he’s from or reveal how layered he is. “You post with your shirt off more than on,” I told him.</p> <p>“That’s accurate,” he said.</p> <p>I ask if he feels a responsibility to speak out, to use his platform to share meaningful stories. As we talk it out, I wonder if I’m taking it all too seriously—I scroll through his feed while he talks, through dozens of photos of him <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BYRjojjBxOn/?hl=en&taken-by=brogan_nyc\" target=\"_blank\">playing with dogs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BWq5XYjhJcJ/?hl=en&taken-by=brogan_nyc\" target=\"_blank\">posing in the mirror</a>. Maybe his feed—and maybe the Instagays—are more harmless than people think. Logan re-grounds the conversation. “I just post what I wanna post. Hopefully it helps someone out because I keep it positive,” he said. “Even if it’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ2gfVJhR7C/?hl=en&taken-by=brogan_nyc\" target=\"_blank\">me dressing up as a dog</a> because I’m fucking stupid and silly, then cool—hopefully it helps someone out.”</p> <p>He talks briefly about <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb755m/a-march-for-chechnya-this-weekend-rallied-all-of-gay-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">Instagays who are speaking out</a> and cites examples of posts where they tell their coming out stories or support an initiative like GLAAD’s Spirit Day; he qualifies that the speaking out is something, even if it’s only “twenty percent of the time.” Then he nicely articulates what I already know. “To expect anyone to be on a mission [to do good] all of the time isn’t realistic.”</p> <p>The next week I connected over the phone with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamjoshuacummings/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua Cummings</a>, 26, a fitness model and aspiring actor and writer. As a person of color, I was curious to see how his experience with Instagram differed from John’s or Logan’s. I also wanted to know whether he approaches Instagram differently given his career (modeling and acting) is most directly impacted by it; John works as an art director and Logan works in sales.</p> <p>Our early conversation was more aligned with my expectations of an Instagay—he possessed a confidence that bordered on arrogance, and threw around words like “my brand” and “my art” when referring to his feed and his body. His Instagram posts are primarily <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BM9WTwzDXaz/?taken-by=iamjoshuacummings\" target=\"_blank\">gym shots</a>, and his stories comprise workouts, facials, haircuts, and other pampering treatments.</p> <p>But as we talked, he revealed a vulnerability rooted in his upbringing not dissimilar to Logan’s, one that’s also wholly absent from his feed.</p> <p>Joshua grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. He was one of eight children in a family that was “very much into the church.” He came out when he was fourteen; at the time, he was dating a guy six years his senior. His family didn’t take that, or his coming out, well, and he moved out when he was fifteen to live with the older man.</p> <p>He came to New York alone when he was eighteen, and spent his first week there sleeping in Penn Station. Suddenly, his arrogance comes across as defiance, a relentless ambition to prove himself. “I told my mom I wanted to be a model when I was 15. She told me there was never gonna be someone like me on a magazine,” he said. “I sent her four magazines featuring me this year.” </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcAyg2kB2GF/?taken-by=iamjoshuacummings\" data-iframely-id=\"2lc0uEa\"> </div> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcAyg2kB2GF/?taken-by=iamjoshuacummings\" data-iframely-id=\"2lc0uEa\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/2lc0uEa?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Despite their complicated coming out stories, Joshua and Logan’s Instagram experiences differ in many key ways—namely, their DMs. While the compliments and flirtations in Logan’s inbox only occasionally go too far, the majority of Joshua’s DMs are explicit. “I’m objectified a lot,” he told me. “Many people, especially white gay men, treat me like an escort. They flat out offer me money, they ask to see my dick.”</p> <p>Still, despite what may be constituted as harassment, he said that, largely thanks to Instagram, “I’ve come to understand who I am, what I want, and what I can do.”</p> <p>When he poses for photographers, he tells me he aims to look “strong and sexual.” And he seeks out photographers who don’t typically shoot black men. “My Instagram is a showcase of what African-American men can do,” he told me—not a showcase of how he’s struggled. “I don’t want total strangers to know all of that. I tell my story and my life through the photographs I’m in; that gives hints of what I’ve been through.”</p> <hr> <p><i>Watch therapist Zach Rawlings discuss body image issues in the gay community:</i> </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/gay-body-liberation/588f8cf08f1ad3ed786007dc\" data-iframely-id=\"iZCiLKj\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/iZCiLKj\"></iframe></div></div> <hr> <p>A couple of weeks after interviewing Logan, he referenced our conversation and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbOBTyehWAN/?hl=en&taken-by=brogan_nyc\" target=\"_blank\">posted with a lengthy caption</a> about his coming out, conversion therapy and all. I’m struck that the deeply personal post, with 1,400 likes, isn’t more popular—a gym selfie on Logan’s feed can easy see over twice that number. But it's barely surprising, given the quick scroll nature of Instagram consumption.</p> <p>If anything, Instagays are as flawed and complicated as the rest of us. But their feeds are filtered to make them appear simpler than they are, and if follows and likes are indication, that’s how we like it.</p> <p>As I wrote this piece, friends asked if it would be an exposé. Ask a typical queer person, and you’ll get a slew of opinions. Shirtless pictures signal vapidity, they’ll say. If they have too many sponsored posts, they're greedy or inauthentic. (And it <i> is</i> astounding <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcDgpZ2nKW7/?hl=en&taken-by=maxisms\" target=\"_blank\">how</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BaACINblrSe/?taken-by=bennyptweets\" target=\"_blank\">creatively</a> an Instagay can draw a connection to a brand.) Posts about mindfulness or inspirational advice that aren’t done right can come across as foolish.</p> <p>It’s a vicious cycle: The more followers a guy gets for his sexy pics, the easier to becomes to monetize their feed and expand their &quot;brand,&quot; and the more valid their clout and influence becomes. But that elevated profile only exposes them to more criticism. The validation begets vilification; like a Shakespearean drama, we build them up only to tear them down.</p> <p>All the criticism reminds me of something both John and Logan said during our conversations—John when I asked about how contrived some of his posts were, and Logan when I prodded him on the logic behind those <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ4xbjFB6Nu/?hl=en&taken-by=brogan_nyc\" target=\"_blank\">sexy dog costume shots</a>. “It’s just Instagram,” they told me.</p> <p>Well, it is.

        "content": "<p>Here it is, plain and simple: I don’t want your cum on my face. I don’t want it on my tits, or anywhere else on my body for that matter. When it comes to sex, I don’t enjoy being demeaned. I don’t appreciate dirty talk that pins me as anything less than equal to you, and I definitely don’t appreciate the pleasure certain men have derived from knowing their dick bruised my cervix. I’m sick of feeling pressured to succumb to that kind of sexual dynamic. Or, equally frustrating, sick of feeling that when I do speak up about it, I’m branding myself a “boring” fuck. </p> <p>If I’ve learned anything in the years I've been sexually active, it's that rough, male-dominated sex—the kind <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/rougher-harder-violent-how-porn-is-warping-the-male-mind/news-story/504698ce318f551052847f13ac678fd1\" target=\"_blank\">often</a> depicted in mainstream pornography—has deeply permeated hookup culture. And <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12201/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">studies have shown</a> that porn consumption corresponds with aggressive sexual behavior in real-life settings. My experiences seem to confirm it: Throughout my early 20s, I found myself with guy after guy who thought it was no big deal to choke me, spank me, pull my hair, and/or jackhammer me with his dick, with no real regard as to whether or not I enjoyed his directionless convulsing. Maybe the latter was because penises are increasingly becoming <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nn97ag/is-death-grip-syndrome-a-masturbation-myth-293\" target=\"_blank\">numb</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/mvk5e4/dipping-my-dick-in-the-nofap-movement\" target=\"_blank\">porn-warped</a> <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/is-internet-porn-making-young-men-impotent-w503299\" target=\"_blank\"> nightmares </a> these days, but that’s no excuse—all this stuff has been done to me by partners who didn’t seek my consent first. I was never asked if I felt comfortable or enjoyed this kind of sex. My partners were either too self-involved to think about my feelings or unaware that sex just isn’t what you see in porn, and made the terrible assumption that their behavior was just what women “like.”</p> <p>For several years, I felt an unspoken pressure to adhere to those kinds of desires, sexual or otherwise. I found it so difficult to get commitment and affection out of the men in my life that I avoided expressing how I really felt, for fear of losing what relationships I did have. I was convinced that if I did, I’d quickly be abandoned for a woman who wasn’t as “fussy” or “high maintenance.” The worst part was that those fears were often proven true. Men have ignored my complaints and left me when I stood up for myself, completely validating the notion that an outspoken woman is a lonely one. Of course, I eventually learned to get over all that and not give a fuck. I know now that real, grown-ass men don’t act that way. But that’s something it took years to figure out—far too long, frankly, and only after kissing way too many frogs (who then forcibly moved my head in the direction of their dicks). </p> <p>Too many heterosexual men make sex all about themselves. It’s time to end that once and for all and make it absolutely clear: Sexual acts performed without affirmative consent from your partner are a form of sexual assault. </p> <p>I think back to the guy who wrapped his hand around my throat tightly, making it hard to breathe simply because that was something he was into. In what universe was that OK? It took him far too long to adhere to my plea for him to let go. And I still went on three more dates with him.</p> <p>I think back to when I was 22, when the much older man I thought I was in love with forcibly flipped me over and pounded away without listening when I said that position hurt too much. That, in fact, only turned him on more. My ensuing silence was apparently some sort of permission to let him finish, but it felt like I had no choice in the matter.</p> <p>I think back to the dozens and dozens of times things like that have happened to me—times that have left me with unwanted bruises or sore body parts. Even if I wasn’t physically harmed, those acts have often left me with an overwhelming feeling of dread. And even when sex wasn’t overtly rough, I’ve still felt demeaned and degraded when men did things that are now somehow considered standard fare: times I’ve been ejaculated on, spanked, and verbally humiliated. </p> <p>My early 20s were a period rife with confusion and disappointment, and nearly every time I had sex, I remember thinking to myself,<i> Isn’t this supposed to be fun?</i> <i>Isn’t sex supposed to end in smiles and euphoria? Shit, at the very least, aren’t we supposed to cuddle afterward?</i></p> <p>All that said, there’s obviously nothing inherently wrong with rough sex or sexual submission, and I don’t mean to shame or other those who love it. Submission can be great! I know plenty of women who enjoy submissive sex in powerful, empowering ways. But women should never, ever be made to be submissive against their will. Men shouldn’t assume their “default” role in sex is to be dominant. And women shouldn’t be made to feel like their sexual prowess is ruined when they aren’t submissive. When our modern cultural discourse has qualified exciting sex as the kind where a girl chokes on his cock, that’s a huge problem.</p> <hr> <p><b><i>Watch </i>VICE News Tonight</b><i><b> explore how the Weinstein scandal will change the reporting of sexual assault:</b></i> </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/heres-why-it-took-30-years-for-the-sexual-harassment-revolution/59fc86a6177dd446f8364140\" data-iframely-id=\"nMddYjf\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/nMddYjf\"></iframe></div></div> <hr> <p>If that’s the case, then yeah, I’m boring as fuck. I’m as plain as they come with my preference for sex where I’m not subject to violence and physical boundaries are respected. And it’s not that I’m a bad fuck, at least in my own humble opinion. In fact, the more sex I had that wasn’t just about what the guy wanted, the more I loosened up and, you know, was able to ride a dick real good or whatever. If you think I don’t like sex after reading this, you’re so, so wrong and probably one of the dudes who ruined my 20s. The fact is, I’m one of the horniest people I know, and I genuinely love sex—when it’s done right, that is.<br></p> <p>I’m a bit older now, and this kind of stuff happens far less than it used to. The men I started meeting got better. I somehow came to realize that not giving a fuck about &quot;disappointing&quot; them in bed is a beautiful thing (though it can be very, very hard to do at times). To the women out there who aren’t quite there yet, know that that’s OK—and, more important, that you absolutely can’t be afraid to say no when you’re not down with something a guy does during sex. Speak up and demand that you get the best sex possible, even if it doesn’t align with some guy’s terrifying Pornhub niche. At the end of the day, this isn’t about your orgasm—it’s about your agency.</p> <p>And to the men who are realizing I’m talking about you, have some accountability for the way you fuck. Don’t shame women into feeling inept because we don’t want to choke on your dick. And don’t get defensive, either. Get empathetic. Get real. And get smarter.</p> <p><i>Follow <a href=\"https://www.alisonstevenson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alison Stevenson</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustAboutGlad\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i><br></p>",

But that was their only major legislative victory of the year. Staring down the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d348kw/these-pro-trump-midwestern-districts-could-swing-the-2018-midterms\" target=\"_blank\">all-too-real prospect</a> of a Democratic sweep in the upcoming elections, the heat is on the GOP to score at least one more major win this year to prove that it can govern. <a href=\"http://time.com/5084907/donald-trump-2018-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\">On Tuesday</a>, the White House laid out an ambitious agenda for the year: tackling healthcare, immigration, and welfare reform and delivering on a huge infrastructure plan, all tantalizing priorities that appeal to sizeable elements of the Republican Party. Yet at the moment all signs seem to indicate that Donald Trump and his allies won’t be able to make much progress on any of them. Instead, 2018 will likely be a grinding legislative shit show. </p> <p>Before Republicans can start any new major legislative pushes, they have to deal with all the vital business they shirked last year to focus on healthcare and taxes. Since September, they have used short-term resolutions to keep the government funded a few weeks at a time rather than tackle a long-term spending bill. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/12/29/trump-in-2018-four-things-to-watch-in-congress-in-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">They also failed to fully reauthorize</a> the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and a host of other government programs, leaving all of them on tenuous short-term life support. And they never got around to voting on a bill <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-agenda-factbox/factbox-trump-congress-face-a-long-to-do-list-in-2018-idUSKBN1ES1T8\" target=\"_blank\">to stabilize the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) individual health insurance marketplaces</a>, something Republican leadership promised to do in exchange for a key tax bill vote from Maine senator Susan Collins. </p> <p>As the last short-term funding measure is set to expire on January 19, Congress’s first task for the year will be keeping the federal government open. It sounds simple enough, but talks on that front are not going well. For funding bills, Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate, so they need bipartisan buy-in from at least nine Democrats. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/367338-leaders-appear-to-make-little-progress-toward-funding-deal\" target=\"_blank\">The Democrats are insisting</a> that any increases in defense spending be matched by increases in non-defense spending. Republican leadership hates this idea. And it doesn’t seem like much compromise is being made between the parties.</p><hr> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/how-republicans-and-democrats-are-responding-to-the-tax-bill/5a25870a177dd472d47d1f87\" data-iframely-id=\"LdvA3mB\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/LdvA3mB\"></iframe></div></div><hr><p>Democrats also insist that any funding bill include provisions reinstating <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-12-29/major-fights-await-congress-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\">protections that Trump lifted in September</a> for Dreamers (undocumented immigrants who came to America as children) and offer them a path to citizenship. Trump and the GOP are willing to deal on the Dreamers, but only if they get increased border security spending and immigration reforms in exchange. But negotiations on what specific trade-offs could be made have been hampered by imprecision from the White House. Trump says he wants an end to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne3d5z/trump-wants-to-crack-down-on-immigration-but-his-hands-are-tied\" target=\"_blank\">“chain migration” and diversity visas</a> as well as funding for his Mexican border wall, but has yet to articulate specific demands, despite the fact his administration <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/367344-senators-say-theyre-waiting-on-white-house-immigration-demands\" target=\"_blank\">has promised those details since mid-December</a>. Leaders from both parties <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/367469-trump-expected-to-call-for-immigration-meeting-amid-stalled-talks\" target=\"_blank\">will meet with Trump next week</a> to try to hash out a deal. But most of Trump’s demands will likely be red lines for the Democrats. Some negotiators worry a deal is growing less likely. </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/367451-senators-battle-over-defense-spending-in-budget-talks\" target=\"_blank\">made it clear</a> he wants to put disaster relief and some healthcare measures (e.g. addressing CHIP) in the funding bill as well. But each of those additions would be another skirmish Congress doesn’t have any bandwidth for right now.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/pggbpz/all-the-laws-and-executive-orders-trump-has-signed-so-far?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=vbyz7a&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>“I expect one way or the other a resolution will be found,” said former longtime Senate staffer and senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Coalition William Hoagland. “It might entail the real threat of a short-term government shutdown around January 20.” But <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/367338-leaders-appear-to-make-little-progress-toward-funding-deal\" target=\"_blank\">no one’s eager</a> to see funding kicked down the road again, and the GOP can’t spare a long shutdown facing midterms.</p> <p>Still, Congress watcher John Johannes cautioned, this doesn’t mean there’s any incentive to compromise on more than spending. “Democrats want to keep the heat on Republicans,” he said, “and half of the GOP members of the house are in a stranglehold caused by fear of being primaried by the far right.” That’s a recipe for intransigence on all other issues, especially something as high-profile and sensitive as the Dreamers.</p> <p>As a result, Congress could end up passing a pure funding bill, or at least agreeing on top-line spending numbers and a short-term funding measure to buy time to work out the actual bills, but kick every other can down the road again. After all, <a href=\"http://time.com/5084067/congress-shutdown-daca-chip/\" target=\"_blank\">most Dreamer protections only expire in early March</a> and temporary funding for CHIP and other programs doesn’t run out until late March. Sure, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz3kgn/a-confused-congress-is-putting-childrens-health-insurance-at-risk\" target=\"_blank\">CHIP is likely already suffering damage</a> in its limbo condition, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/daca-dreamers-white-house-congress-negotiations-326356\" target=\"_blank\">some Dreamers</a> have already lost their protected status. But these days Congress doesn’t act until it’s facing an actual major crisis.</p> <p>Hoagland suspects most of the first quarter of the year will be eaten up by debates on balancing Dreamer protections against Trump’s demands. By the time that’s (hopefully) resolved in March, Congress will be <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/366836-five-fights-facing-congress-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\">staring down another debt ceiling crisis</a>. So at best, Congress won’t be able to start work in any serious way on a new major legislative push until early April.</p> <p>Common wisdom holds that the wisest decision at that point would be to focus on infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-12-29/major-fights-await-congress-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Some Democrats have said</a> they would work with the GOP on this, which would provide a rare moment of bipartisanship. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/366836-five-fights-facing-congress-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\">And the administration has promised</a> a comprehensive blueprint for legislators to jump off of sometime this month.</p> <p>Then again, they’ve been promising an infrastructure plan was just around the corner for almost a year. And House Speaker Paul Ryan seems hell bent on turning to welfare reform—meaning welfare cuts—at the first opportunity this year, with tacit approval from the White House, despite Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-12-29/major-fights-await-congress-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\">campaign promises</a> to leave entitlement systems intact. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbyvj4/republicans-passed-their-tax-bill-now-they-have-to-fix-it\" target=\"_blank\">Some analysts believe</a> the deficit-inflating tax bill was in part a ploy by Ryan to force Republicans to back welfare reforms to balance the budget. </p> <p>That would be a dummy move. Republicans can’t even agree among themselves on how to address welfare, dooming any initiative to a slow death by infighting. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-agenda-factbox/factbox-trump-congress-face-a-long-to-do-list-in-2018-idUSKBN1ES1T8\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats can spin any attempt</a> at reforms as a war on the poor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he doesn’t want to work with Ryan on this, teeing up mid-year inter-chamber conflicts.</p> <p>There’s a similar intra-party conflict brewing over healthcare reforms. Some Republican senators are threatening to essentially hold the year’s wider agenda hostage until they can take another crack at repealing the ACA. But thanks to the slimming of the GOP’s Senate majority <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyddx3/doug-jones-cant-stop-the-insane-republican-tax-bill\" target=\"_blank\">with the arrival of Democrat Doug Jones</a>, such a push is even less likely to succeed in 2018 than 2017, making it an unattractive energy sink for some in the Republican caucus. </p> <p>Even infrastructure would be a complicated bit of business. People in both parties agree something needs to be done about America’s ailing bridges, dams, and roads. But <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kpd4b/where-the-fuck-is-trumps-infrastructure-plan\" target=\"_blank\">the Democrats are not fond</a> of the approaches Trump and the Republicans have floated thus far. And any plan will involve a fair amount of federal spending—something conservatives will be <a href=\"http://time.com/5084907/donald-trump-2018-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\">more loathe to support than usual</a> after passing a pricey tax bill. Hoagland currently puts the odds of seeing such a bill pass within 2018 at about 50–50.</p> <p>It’s also worth remembering that, throughout the year, Congress will periodically be forced to shift its focus from putting out the trash fires of 2017 and addressing its ambitious agenda by the nuts and bolts tasks of governing. To wit, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/12/29/trump-in-2018-four-things-to-watch-in-congress-in-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">a few programs will need reauthorization</a> this year as well. And <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbyvj4/republicans-passed-their-tax-bill-now-they-have-to-fix-it\" target=\"_blank\">the Republican tax bill</a> will slowly reveal flaws that need prompt legislative fixes. </p> <p>Then there are all the unknowns that could derail Congress. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/02/politics/2018-donald-trump-mueller-north-korea-politics/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Mueller’s investigation</a> into Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election is ongoing and could yield nasty surprises. A natural or foreign policy disaster could suck the air out of DC at any given moment. </p> <p>And of course, noted Johannes, “the 2018 election is growing in importance, and it overshadows everything else.” Campaigning takes time, and scares legislators away from big votes.</p> <p>So that’s what America has to look forward to in 2018 in Congress: a tooth-and-nail battle to resolve issues that should have been resolved last year, and not much else. Or, as Johannes put it, 2018 will be “a lot of inaction with a ton of noise.” </p><p><i>Follow Mark Hay on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goraladka\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

The 64-year-old, who wrote the screenplays for <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> and <i>Crash</i>, was already being sued by a publicist for an alleged rape in 2013 when three more alleged victims came forward to say they had been abused by him as well.</p><p>The lawsuit filed on December 15 claims that Haggis offered then-28-year-old Haleigh Breest a ride home after a film premiere, and then drove her back to his apartment in Manhattan. According to the complaint, he invited Breest up for a drink and then allegedly ripped her tights off, forced her to perform oral sex, and raped her as she said, &quot;No.&quot; Haggis has already countersued and said that victim's ask of $9 million amounted to extortion.</p><p>After hearing about the civil suit<i>, </i>three more women came forward to report similar abuse from Haggis to Breest's lawyer and recounted their experiences to the AP. One of the women interviewed said she was also a 28-year-old publicist who had been raped by Haggis. She claims that, in 1996, she was working on one of his TV shows when he showed up to her office after hours one night and started forcibly kissing her. </p><p>&quot;I just pulled away. He was just glaring at me and came at me again,&quot; she told the AP. &quot;I was really resisting. He said to me, 'Do you really want to continue working?'&quot;</p><p>She said he then made her perform oral sex before pushing her to the ground and raping her.</p><p>A third accuser said that in 2000 she went to pitch Haggis a television show at his office, when he started to talk about wanting to have extramarital affairs. She claims he then tried to kiss her before she could run away. A fourth woman said that in 2015, when she was in her late 20s, Haggis forcibly kissed her, jumped into the taxi she tried to escape in, and then harassed her with text messages for 24 hours after she got inside her house.</p><p>Haggis—who worked on films that won Best Picture at the Oscars in 2005 and 2006—has said through his lawyer that he &quot;didn’t rape anybody.&quot; As the AP points out, he recently spoke to the <i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/21/hollywood-finished-paul-haggis-harvey-weinstein-scandal\" target=\"_blank\">Guardian</a></i> about the #MeToo movement and Harvey Weinstein in favor of the so-called reckoning.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people are compromised by Harvey’s alleged actions,&quot; he said in October. &quot;Although everyone thinks it is vile behavior, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him. For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?&quot;</p><p><i>Follow Allie Conti on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allie_conti\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

Even Howard Stern will drop by for a chat.</p><p>While the show will center on a single in-depth interview per episode, don't expect one continuous, 60-minute chat. Along with the interviews, each episode will reportedly feature &quot;field segments&quot; where Letterman digs deeper &quot;on a specific topic related to the iconic guest,&quot; according to a <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSy4EnrWkAEe8IN.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. Hopefully that means he'll get the scoop on Clooney's <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/12/14/george-clooney-million-dollar-gift/\" target=\"_blank\">suitcases full of money</a> or whatever.</p><p>Episodes of <i>My Next Guest</i> will roll out monthly on Netflix over the next six months, so don't expect to binge the whole thing all at once. Give the trailer a watch above before Obama's episode drops on January 12.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Old-school drug warrior Jeff Sessions ticked off 2018 with aplomb Thursday when he <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/9knqgz/it-looks-like-jeff-sessions-is-kicking-off-his-war-on-legal-weed\" target=\"_blank\">revoked</a> Obama-era memos protecting state experimentation with legal weed. Federal prosecutors across the country <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d34xza/the-stoners-guide-to-trumps-new-weed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">now have more discretion to go after people</a> who might be obeying local medical and recreational pot laws, which govern more than half the states in America. This is bad news for people who own pot businesses, the banks and financiers tempted to do business with them, and, to a lesser extent, individual pot users. </p> <p>Sessions’s statement formalizing a version of a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg5ex9/what-would-happen-if-jeff-sessions-goes-after-legal-weed\" target=\"_blank\">long-feared pot crackdown</a> put the onus on lawmakers, however, citing “Congress’ determination that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime.” On that point, he’s actually totally correct. Pot is still officially a dangerous drug, <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/166529/what-schedule-is-marijuana-dea-schedule-1-drugs-and-why-classifications-matter#.FqA4pD3Lz\" target=\"_blank\">on par with heroin</a>, under the Controlled Substances Act. The Obama-era memos were always vulnerable to the whims of a future attorney general; they were never a solution for the war on drugs.</p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/cnn-weed/5a4c07e6177dd47c301bc951\" data-iframely-id=\"6T2yNBs\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/6T2yNBs\"></iframe></div></div> <hr><p>In other words, you can only legalize marijuana by actually legalizing marijuana, permanently, at the federal level. Which is to say Democrats should stop being so characteristically flimsy—and take full advantage of the Trump administration's potentially catastrophic political mistake—by vowing to legalize marijuana if and when they get back into power.</p> <p>Too many Democrats, particularly the congressional leadership, have been <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-marijuana-crackdown-democratic-party-election-politics_us_5a4ecee7e4b089e14db9ae04?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004\" target=\"_blank\">weirdly passive</a> in their reaction, grumbling that Sessions should put more effort and resources into other criminal prosecutions, while refusing to commit to fixing the problem legislatively. Lawmakers seem most angry about Sessions forcing them to have to take a stand on marijuana policy, instead of relying on a fragile non-prosecution agreement.</p> <p>This Hamlet Act is at least a step up from President Obama’s dismissal of legalization advocacy as deeply unserious. Even as Obama moved from <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216\" target=\"_blank\">punitive crackdowns on pot growers</a> in his first term to an uneasy peace in the second, in a 2015 <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/video/president-barack-obama-speaks-with-vice-news\" target=\"_blank\">VICE News interview</a>, he warned young people, “You should be thinking about climate change, the economy, jobs, war and peace. Maybe, way at the bottom, you should be thinking about marijuana.”</p> <p>Not only was this condescension unnecessary, it was wrong. Legalization is a public health issue—locking up people for nonviolent drug offenses is unconscionable, and there is <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ezxkvk/how-weed-is-curbing-opioid-addiction-for-some-canadians\" target=\"_blank\">lots of evidence</a> that the pain-relief properties of marijuana can reduce the deadly reliance on opioids, the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">deadliest drug epidemic</a> in US history. It’s a racial justice issue, given the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qbw7xp/the-war-on-weed-still-expensive-racist-and-failed\" target=\"_blank\">disproportionate number of minorities</a> arrested and imprisoned for marijuana use and possession. It’s a foreign policy issue—America <a href=\"https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact_sheet_Drug_War_Budget_Feb2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">spends unbelievable resources</a> battling Latin American drug gangs, whose revenue would likely dry up under a legal regime. It’s increasingly a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmvy9j/one-easy-fix-for-americas-infrastructure-crisis-weed\" target=\"_blank\">revenue-gainer</a> for states. And passing laws that keep marijuana a <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/733403/legal-pot-new-gay-marriage\" target=\"_blank\">small-craft business</a> while <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/legal-weed-isnt-the-boon-small-businesses-thought-it-would-be/?src=obsidebar=sb_1\" target=\"_blank\">preventing consolidation</a> could make it a model for an economy where gains are broadly shared, a welcome contrast in an era of seemingly relentless march toward monopoly.</p> <p>It’s easy for Democrats to make the cold political calculation that legalization is <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/221018/record-high-support-legalizing-marijuana.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">incredibly popular</a>, especially among <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/25/marijuana-turnout-poll_n_5030351.html\" target=\"_blank\">infrequent voters</a> whose turnout is needed to take back Congress. But there’s a more elemental question here: What is an opposition party for other than drawing distinctions between its agenda and that of the party in power? Legalization is <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everyone-agrees-that-weed-is-great-except-politicians/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the least-polarizing issues</a> out there—even Republican voters give it majority support in some national surveys.</p><p>Sessions's bonehead move puts the Trump administration squarely on the wrong side of history. Democrats need only stand with the people to reap the benefits.</p> <p>Nobody has to reinvent the wheel here: there’s already legislation in Congress, with bipartisan support, that would make Sessions's decision irrelevant. Senator Cory Booker’s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qv3dd3/cory-booker-explains-why-hes-making-legal-weed-his-signature-issue\" target=\"_blank\">Marijuana Justice Act</a> would remove pot from the list of controlled substances and expunge all marijuana-related federal convictions. There are two House versions of the bill: the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1227\" target=\"_blank\">Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act</a>, with 15 co-sponsors, five of them Republicans, and the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1841\" target=\"_blank\">Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act</a> (17 co-sponsors), which would let the Food and Drug Administration test pot for safety. A softer version, the <a href=\"https://t.co/gPLzua0RpS\" target=\"_blank\">Respect State Marijuana Laws Act</a>, would exempt Controlled Substances Act regulation in any state where marijuana is legal. That has 24 co-sponsors, 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans. A bipartisan <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg5k39/legal-weed-is-the-last-bipartisan-cause-in-america\" target=\"_blank\">Congressional Cannabis Caucus</a> could lead on any of these bills. </p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/43qnpn/even-republicans-hate-jeff-sessionss-new-weed-policy?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=ev5avz&site=vice\"></iframe></div> <p>Even something as simple as the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2215/text\" target=\"_blank\">SAFE Banking Act</a> would allow marijuana businesses to get a checking account and swipe debit cards without financial institutions who work with them fearing prosecution. This bid to end the incredibly unnecessary danger of all-cash marijuana businesses at risk of criminal targeting has 58 co-sponsors in the House.</p> <p>So Democrats don’t even have to write new policy to meet the wishes of the public; they just have to support what already exists. To do that, though, they’ll need to understand the role of a political party in a democracy: identify ways to improve people’s lives, and then to actually commit to enacting them. If Democrats finally figure this out and support marijuana legalization, Republicans will have a choice, too: stick with Trump and Sessions and face the ire of the electorate, or join Democrats, at which point the public wins. Some Republicans, like <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/politicians-react-jeff-sessions-reverse-marijuana-legal_us_5a4e58dde4b06d1621bddc48\" target=\"_blank\">Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado</a>, are already rejecting Sessions's action; the issue has the potential to split the right.</p> <p>It's not like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/repblumenauer/status/949065479192117248\" target=\"_blank\">some Democrats</a> haven't been boldly fighting for legalization for some time. But the rest need to get over the party’s residual <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/129433/clintons-war-drugs-black-lives-didnt-matter\" target=\"_blank\">drug-warrior past</a> and unite on a public-policy priority that would stabilize communities and save lives. Jeff Sessions does not actually have the power to dictate federal marijuana policy; Congress does. Democrats have to recognize that, and vow to do something revolutionary: use their own power.</p><p><i>Follow David Dayen on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddayen\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i></p>",

Read on for our staff recommendations on what to take in during your downtime:</i> </p> <h2>The Golden Globes</h2> <p>Hoo boy, this is gonna be something else, huh? Can you think of a year in which it'd be a worse idea for Hollywood to gather around and celebrate itself? Well, I think that could pretty much apply to every year, but regardless: The multiplexes are empty, there aren't any good albums out, and nothing's on TV to really binge hard on for at least a few more weeks. You have nothing better to do on Sunday night, and neither do I. <i>—Larry Fitzmaurice, Senior Culture Editor, Digital </i> </p> <h2> <i>The Chi</i> </h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://youtu.be/oPqbhroAPWI\" data-iframely-id=\"emEhCge\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/emEhCge?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>Lena Waithe is really smart and cool. She wrote a celebrated episode of last season's <i>Master of None</i>, &quot;Thanksgiving,&quot; which netted her an Emmy—and now she's created Showtime's first new show of 2018, <i>The Chi</i>, which zeroes in on life in Chicago's South Side neighborhoods. Waithe wrote the first episode, which airs this Sunday, directed by Rick Famuyiwa. He directed <i> Dope</i>, a movie I didn't see but my fiancée watched on an airplane once when we were sitting apart from each other. She said the movie's good. I believe her! So why not watch <i> The Chi</i> too? <i>—LF</i> </p> <h2> <i>The West Wing</i> </h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiUnPFHhcY\" data-iframely-id=\"dCw5Tat\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/dCw5Tat?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>If you spent the week in the fetal position watching the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992\" target=\"_blank\">inch us ever closer to nuclear conflict</a>, following his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-statement-steve-bannon.html\" target=\"_blank\">messy public breakup</a> with Steve Bannon, or reading about <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-wolff-my-insane-year-inside-trumps-white-house-1071504\" target=\"_blank\">chaotic</a> <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\">White House affairs</a>, I recommend you spend the weekend watching <i> The West Wing</i>. Looking back, Aaron Sorkin's seven-season TV drama is probably the furthest it gets from the political realities of today. It’s soothing—even hilarious—to see a press secretary get along with the press corps, staffers relieved that a damaging story was posted online and not in print, and a POTUS who can definitely read. Sometimes the best way to cope with the Trump administration is to enter into an alternate reality in which politicians don't have Twitter, and where they run the country with grace, competence, and a little integrity. <i>—Lauren Messman, Associate Editor</i> </p> <h2> <i>Firefly</i> </h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPRlHwwVIug\" data-iframely-id=\"5f1Oy3O\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/5f1Oy3O?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>The silver lining to dark, frigid New York winters is that the weather gives you permission to be an absolute couch-slug without feeling bad about it. I like binging really old, but really great TV shows, sometimes stoned, in order to get through January/February. Last year it was <i>Alias</i>. This year it's <i>Firefly</i>. Literally the only drawback to this series is that it's so short—there's only one season to savor. But everything else is incredible: It's a sci-fi western by Joss Whedon with really badass women in complex, interesting roles. If you, like me, have somehow never seen it, get thee to your couch and watch it, posthaste! <i>—Kara Weisenstein</i> </p> <h2> <i>Blade Runner: The Final Cut</i> </h2> <div> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"> <img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1515172945757-CopyrightWarnerBros_CourtesyEverettCollection.jpeg\"> </picture> <div>© Warner Bros., courtesy Everett Collection</div> </div> <p>There's more than one way to skin a replicant, as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versions_of_Blade_Runner#The_Director%27s_Cut_(1992)\" target=\"_blank\">seven-or-so-odd versions</a> of the original <i>Blade Runner</i> illustrate.

        "content": "<p>When a producer at FOX News asked me if I wanted to be an on-air guest, I should have known better. It was the spring of 2014, and I was working at an alt-weekly, making very little money and desperate for an opportunity to advance both my career and lot in life. So I said yes, and later that day, a limo came and picked me up at my crumbling apartment and drove me to a local news station where I was made-up like a contestant in a child beauty pageant. I was on Greta Van Susteren's show to talk about a <a href=\"http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/scottish-royal-couple-game-welfare-systems-in-two-states-6353985\" target=\"_blank\">story I was chasing</a> about a couple who pretended to be Scottish royalty, though they were actually living off of entitlement programs. I didn't initially question why FOX News was interested in my reporting, though when Greta asked me if I thought what the couple was doing was morally right, it became very obvious: I was there to bash welfare on cable news and provide millions of Middle Americans with a talking point that I didn't personally agree with.</p><p>That faux Scottish couple were grifters to be sure, and in no way emblematic of the millions of hardworking Americans who need a little help to get by. But after fighting back and heading home to that rundown apartment, I couldn't help but wonder: Was our entitlement system a bit wonky, even if it wasn't in the way that the FOX News crowd liked to pretend it was? For instance, in rare cases, could it <i>theoretically</i> make sense to refuse a raise because it might disqualify you for benefits that are technically &quot;worth&quot; more than the additional income? I'm always a little wary when my income goes up, because it just increases my student loan payments, too. I'm similarly afraid that I'll go into a different tax bracket and therefore fuck myself over.</p><p>When I called up Jesse Rothstein, a public policy professor and the director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California Berkeley, he told me that I was right about the general idea, though I had the specifics wrong.</p><p>&quot;People commonly think that what happens is you go from paying 10 percent tax on all of your income to paying 15 percent tax on all of your income,&quot; he said. &quot;But that's not how it works. You pay 10 percent on your income up to that threshold, and then you pay 15 percent above that. I think of it as a sequence of buckets. You fill it up, and once that one's full, you move on to the next one. But it's not that all of a sudden everything gets dumped into a bigger bucket. That's what you would need to have happen to trigger any sort of negative effect.&quot;</p><p>Despite the fact that I called him and essentially asked him to defend a bad-faith argument beloved by conservative assholes, Rothstein copped to the fact that sometimes it does make sense to make less money. But of course, that doesn't mean poor people who make this calculation are lazy; it means our system is terribly, terribly broken. Here's how it all shakes out:</p><h2>Healthcare</h2><p>Rothstein explained that the term I was looking for was &quot;subsidy cliff&quot;—or the point at which a small raise in income changes the level of benefits you're eligible for.<br></p><p>&quot;It's a pretty unusual circumstance where you literally get more back by reducing your earnings,&quot; he hedged. &quot;It's more common that you get less back than the amount of the increase in earnings.&quot; The most common place it does seem to happen, though, is with health insurance.</p><p>The way Obamacare works is that people who don't have health insurance through their employer can buy it online through a number of state exchanges. The premiums are, in principle, supposed to be made affordable through a tax credit that applies to people who are making fewer than 400 percent of what's known as the federal poverty level, or the FPL. (For these purposes, income is considered gross pay minus above-the-line deductions like contributions to a retirement account, interest on student loans, moving expenses, and more, plus tax-exempt municipal bond interest, plus untaxed Social Security benefits.)</p><p>The Obamacare subsidy is meant to phase out and not really have a cliff, though a small one does exist. Here's an example based on the below three facts: </p><ul><li>In 2017, for a family of one, the FPL times four <a href=\"https://thefinancebuff.com/federal-poverty-levels-for-obamacare.html\" target=\"_blank\">was</a> $47,520. </li><li>The subsidy is based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost &quot;Silver&quot; plan.</li><li> You'll never pay <a href=\"https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7962-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">more</a> than 9.5 percent of your income.</li></ul><p>OK, so:</p><ul><li>Say the cost of a Silver Plan under Obamacare in your state is: $9,500 a year.</li><li>And your hypothetical income is $45,000.</li><li>Take 9.5 percent of that income: $4,275.</li><li>And do some subtraction to find out your Obamacare subsidy: $9,500 - $4,275 = $5,225.</li></ul><p>The subsidy cliff comes when your adjusted income is $1 more than 400 times the FPL. That's when you lose the tax credit. If the credit above amounts to $5,225, basically any raise that's less than that isn't worth it for our hypothetical worker. A small cost-of-living raise that would put the worker up to $48,000 would cost him or her an insurance credit worth more than $5,000.<br></p><p>Obviously, there's only a small sliver of people who are affected by this. However, things stand to get worse for them under Trump. &quot;If those individual insurance markets in the exchanges get more and more broken at the end of the mandate, which is part of the tax bill, that raises the unsubsidized price of getting insurance,&quot; Rothstein told me. &quot;But it doesn't raise the cost of insurance if you have subsidies. So that basically makes the cliff bigger.&quot;</p><p>The Trump administration's systematic dismantling of Obamacare means two things. First, the tax credits for Obamacare will go up, which means that people who make under four times the federal poverty level will pay even less for insurance. That's good! But the second thing that will happen—the corollary of that—is that people who already don't qualify for the credit right now will see their premiums soar. So, take our hypothetical person who might get a cost-of-living raise of a few hundred bucks that disqualifies them from the subsidy. If the cost of a Silver Plan goes up by 37 percent, as Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-premiums/obamacare-benchmark-premiums-up-37-percent-in-2018-after-subsidy-cut-off-idUSKBN1CZ2DG\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> it will, and they have to pay the full price, the so-called subsidy cliff will go from being a slight drop to a header off a skyscraper.</p><h2>Financial Aid</h2><p>The Pell grant is the bedrock of the student financial aid system, and there are instances that it makes sense to quit your job so that you can collect one. Bear with me for what sounds like a PSAT math problem, albeit one that I answer for you.</p><p>Households making less than $50,000 a year during the 2016–2017 school year were eligible to receive a Pell grant of <a href=\"https://teststudentaid.ed.gov/testise/about/announcements/pell-2016-17\" target=\"_blank\">up to</a> $5,815, though the <a href=\"https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/grants/federal-grants/\" target=\"_blank\">majority</a> of that money goes to students with household incomes of less than $20,000. Say you were a student working a part-time job about ten hours a week that paid $8.10 an hour—the minimum wage in Florida—and netted around $4,212 a year. You'd pay no federal income tax on the amount, but you would probably knock off a few hundred bucks between Social Security and state/local taxes to make your income right around $4,000. You live with your mom who makes $17,000 a year, so your household income is right on the cusp of $20,000, plus or minus a few bucks. You could not work and theoretically get a Pell grant that's worth more than your total income.<br></p><p>That scenario sounds a lot like a cliff to me. To find out if there was a version of the phenomenon in student aid, I called up Mark Kantrowitz—an author and member of the board of trustees for the Center for Excellence in Education, as well as one of the leading experts in student financial aid and scholarships.</p><p>Kantrowitz said that the scenario sounded plausible, though far from common. He confirmed my suspicion that I was onto something and gave me a ton of information on how aid is calculated. Basically, the formula is the maximum Pell grant amount for a given year minus expected family contribution (EFC), which is calculated by the FAFSA using a complicated formula based on the student and parent income, assets, family size, number of children in college, age of the older parent, and various other demographic factors.</p><p>If your EFC is 90 percent of what it costs for you to go to school or more, you get nothing from the federal government. Otherwise, you get the difference. This also means that someone who might get a lot of money to go to a private school that costs $70,000 a year would get nothing to go to a public in-state school. Attending a private school (and getting education that arguably has higher value due to a litany of factors) would create a greater difference between the two values.</p><p>The education expert also pointed to evidence that a cliff is widening under our current Congress. The Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) set the maximum Pell grant from the year 2010 to the year 2020. Five of those years the maximum amount of the grant was supposed to increase with the inflation rate, and the other five years it wasn't supposed to increase at all. Congress could have chosen to keep it tied to inflation, though they didn't. </p><p>If the maximum Pell grant amount shrinks in real dollars because it's not going up with the cost of inflation, and the ETF goes up because it's tied to inflation, then according to the formula, the amount of money one would receive is less than it would be otherwise. If your family set aside enough money for you to have $4,000 per semester to go to school and the amount of the maximum Pell grant stagnates, your family is getting less bang for their buck.</p><p>To be clear, these scenarios only apply to a small group of people. And though it's absurd to suggest that anyone is purposefully making less money to reap governmental reward, it's plain to see that some would stand to benefit by doing so. But as Congress prepares to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3xz7m/the-tax-bill-is-a-fucking-disaster\" target=\"_blank\">widen the gap</a> between the rich and poor by redistributing even more wealth to the One Percent, it's worth looking at the middle-class people who will fall through the cracks. If the growing subsidy cliff makes the difference between someone having healthcare and not being able to pay for it, or going to an elite school or a public one, it should be talked about. If we're not prepared to make access to a doctor or higher education universal, it's worth wondering how we can abide by a system in which it sometimes makes sense to make less money.</p><p><i>Follow Allie Conti on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allie_conti\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter.</a></i><br></p>",

        "content": "<p>&quot;I think Jeff Sessions has forgotten about the constitution and the tenth amendment,&quot; California Republican Dana Rohrabacher said in a Thursday press call with four other pro-marijuana legalization congresspeople. The call was in response to the announcement that day by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withdraw the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Cole memo</a>, an Obama-era policy that effectively instructed feds to lay off marijuana businesses in states that have legalized the drug except in cases where, for instance, dealers were sending pot across state lines. <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d34xza/the-stoners-guide-to-trumps-new-weed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Under Sessions's new policy</a>, US attorneys have the discretion to prosecute weed cases. </p><p>&quot;Do you know anyone who supports the attorney general's decision?&quot; a reporter asked during the call. No, replied <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg5k39/legal-weed-is-the-last-bipartisan-cause-in-america\" target=\"_blank\">members of the Cannabis Caucus</a>.</p><p>As the bipartisan group of lawmakers emphasized throughout the call, the idea of the Department of Justice going after legal marijuana businesses in the eight states—and the District of Colombia—that have voted to legalize the drug infringes on states' rights and goes against the will of the people. It can't be emphasized enough that prosecuting marijuana cases is unpopular. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/25/for-the-first-time-a-majority-of-republicans-support-marijuana-legalization/?utm_term=.ffc535e9caf9&tid=a_inl\" target=\"_blank\">Sixty-four percent</a> of Americans, and 51 percent of Republicans, favor federal legislation. <br></p><p>The reasons are obvious enough. &quot;Marijuana is a lot better than alcohol. I want to stress that because alcohol creates violence, and I've seen great people cut somebody's head off drunk. You don't see that with marijuana. I'm not condoning it. I'm saying that was the effect upon them, and now they smoke,&quot; Alaska congressman Don Young <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg5k39/legal-weed-is-the-last-bipartisan-cause-in-america\" target=\"_blank\">told me</a> last April.</p><p>Studies have shown that it's <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/marijuana-safer-than-alcohol-tobacco_n_6738572.html\" target=\"_blank\">safer to consume</a> than alcohol or tobacco, two drugs that are legal to use in the United States. Nevertheless, in Sessions's reversal of the Cole memo, he <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1022196/download\" target=\"_blank\">asserted</a>, &quot;Marijuana is a dangerous drug and... marijuana activity is a serious crime.&quot; (Sessions once reportedly quipped that he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2009/05/specter_helped_defeat_sessions.html\" target=\"_blank\">used to</a> think the Klu Klux Klan was &quot;OK until I found out they smoked pot.&quot;)</p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/will-california-weed-growers-survive-legal-marijuana/5a4bd3a8177dd464ca67cceb\" data-iframely-id=\"5l50VAl\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/5l50VAl?summary=true&amp;app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><hr><p>Congress has been quick to condemn Sessions's latest anti-legal marijuana decree. Cory Gardner, Colorado's Republican senator, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenCoryGardner/status/948934654685601792\" target=\"_blank\">vowed to</a> hold up &quot;DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation.&quot; (The commitment being that he would leave legal weed alone.)</p><p>&quot;Effectively, this leaves the legal status of marijuana up to 93 US attorneys across the country. Whatever side of the bed these government bureaucrats wake up on can literally determine the freedom and liberty or the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of American citizens,&quot; Colorado Democrat Jared Polis explained during Thursday's call.</p><p>&quot;I'm convinced that the backlash that a number of my colleagues have talked about is going to be felt. I think the Attorney General is actually creating problems for the Trump administration,&quot; Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer added. </p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/pg5k39/legal-weed-is-the-last-bipartisan-cause-in-america?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=43qnpn&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>Even members of Congress who hadn't been explicitly pro-marijuana legalization before this move spoke out in support of state marijuana laws. “Although I did not support the 2014 ballot initiative to legalize marijuana, it strongly passed and I passionately believe in democracy and the principles of states’ rights,&quot; Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-statement-on-change-to-federal-marijuana-enforcement-policy\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> on Thursday. &quot;Today’s action by the Department of Justice... could be the impetus necessary for Congress to find a permanent legislative solution for states that have chosen to regulate the production, sale and use of marijuana.&quot; </p><p>I couldn't find any senator or representative who has gone on the record supporting Sessions's latest move, though it was cheered by anti-marijuana groups like Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM). “This is a good day for public health. The days of safe harbor for multi-million dollar pot investments are over,” SAM president Kevin A. Sabet said in a <a href=\"https://learnaboutsam.org/doj-will-rescind-cole-memo-public-health-safety-communities-applaud-move/\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. &quot;DOJ’s move will slow down the rise of Big Marijuana.&quot;<br></p><p>Although the congresspeople from states with legal weed are concerned about Sessions changing DOJ policy, they were quick to point out that even after the Cole memo was issued in 2013, Obama's DOJ was still somewhat hostile to legal marijuana. The solution, they believe, is passing a bill that prevents the federal government from interfering with state marijuana rights, and ending federal marijuana prohibition.<br></p><p>&quot;The Cole [memo] wasn't going to make it any easier or anymore difficult to put into legislation those things that we really need to put in [to protect legal marijuana],&quot; Rohrabacher said. &quot;As we go back into the session, there would be no open discussion of it, and our constituencies wouldn't have been alerted of it had the Cole memo not been withdrawn. So this is a big plus for our efforts.&quot;</p><p><i>Follow Eve Peyser on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/evepeyser\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i><br></p>",

Ahead of its release Friday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixelatedboat\" target=\"_blank\">@pixelatedboat</a>—a parody Twitter account—posted a fake excerpt from the book all about the president's unquenchable desire to watch &quot;the gorilla channel.&quot;<br></p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/pixelatedboat/status/949100087350710272\" data-iframely-id=\"EEC6EO9\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/EEC6EO9?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>The joke, of course, went viral. It's one of @pixelatedboat's go-to bits: writing fake, goofy-ass tirades and posting them as if celebrities <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixelatedboat/status/947987873218695169\" target=\"_blank\">actually</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixelatedboat/status/808660914526294016\" target=\"_blank\">said them</a>.

Apparently Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/04/donald-trump-white-house-domestic-life-cheeseburger\" target=\"_blank\">doesn't let his maids touch his toothbrush</a> for fear of being poisoned.

        "content": "<p>Peer pressure is bad, but if you took issue with the premiere episode of <i>The X Files</i>'s 11th season, you should probably get high and chill. I’m not telling you that you <i> have </i>to partake to enjoy it, but watching Mulder and Scully fumble around in the dark with some flashlights whilst chonged on a bobo is one of the last minor American luxuries that everyone can enjoy. </p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39BFAtXw7JU\" data-iframely-id=\"7l7Oo8K\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/7l7Oo8K?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>In a world where nuclear war feels less like a threat and more like a GCal invite I have yet to reply to, the fact that there are new episodes of <i>The X-Files </i>blows fresh, THC-laden air into my lifelong commitment to turning on, tuning in, and dropping out. It’s the closest I’ll probably ever get to the feeling of renewing my wedding vows, only my partner in sickness and in health takes the form of two mid-level government employees fighting against a galactic alien conspiracy. The show's an 11-season love story told through off-hand glimpses, with as many inconceivable twists and turns in 52 minutes as there are in a year of the current White House. You’re <i> not</i> gonna watch that high?</p> <p>Seriously, the only logical reason I can come up with for why us reefer heads are hell-bent on ingesting weapons-grade THC percentages is to make watching things like <i> The X-Files</i> even more entertaining. Whether or not it’s a gateway to other things, you simply cannot deny its influence over generations of open minds—weed, I mean. But did you know there’s also a strain of weed called X-Files? Yeah. <i>The X-Files</i> is weed. And there are people who hate weed so much they want to destroy it. It’s messed up!</p> <p>When <i> The X-Files</i> returned after a 13-year hiatus, it was less a gift for fans of the show's story than it was for fans of a certain—dare I say psychoactive—approach to storytelling. It's a universe imbued with depth not through plot but through truly three-dimensional characters. Manipulating the way you tell it allows your audience to glimpse the magical: See <i> The Twilight Zone</i>’s “Twenty-Two,” <i>Breaking Bad</i>’s “Fly,” and<i> The X-Files</i>’s own “Monday” for unforgettable examples of style slam-dunking on popular conceptions of substance—and well-executed style often comes from people who are <i>relaxed</i>, if you get my drift.<br></p> <p>On the other hand, you have the utterly un-stonerly self-seriousness that means Jon Snow can’t go wight-hunting without cheapening all of Westeros. Even Eleven can’t have her “trip to the big city” episode without lifting veil on the illusion that <i> Stranger Things</i> is more than a hundred-million-dollar ad for a “retro-inspired new arrivals” collection at your mall’s alt-department store. In an era where more Americans everyday actually believe the earth is flat, we need TV that gets as high as we do.</p> <p>The best part about pot is that it makes plot holes less pressing than possibilities, and that’s why I’ll be watching the new season of <i> The X-Files</i>—the show that <i>is</i> weed, way higher than an earthbound <i> It</i> balloon. And if you’re the type who'd rather argue on the ship than take a spacewalk, suit yourself: You didn’t want to believe in the first place. </p>",

I'm always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. Last week, I nodded off at a meeting—even though I was outside and standing up. My mouth and eyes always feel dry, despite my drinking 100 ounces of water a day. My bowel movements, according to what I learned on an episode of <i> Dr. Oz</i>, could indicate cancer. (I don't have internet access, so yeah, I watch <i> Dr. Oz</i> for medical advice on a personal 15-inch TV.) </p> <p>Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night with cramps in my calves. I occasionally get electric shock–type feelings in my toes. I have sciatica that never fully healed, and there is a bump on the base of my lower spine that stinks. Plus I have Raynaud’s disease, which means less blood circulates to my fingers and toes when it gets cold. </p> <p>Also, my blood pressure charts around 88 over 65, though the nurses say that's a good thing.</p> <hr> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/solitary-confinement-project-30-days-of-voluntary-isolation/584ebe681616608a04eb540b\" data-iframely-id=\"yIHGk2\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/yIHGk2\"></iframe></div></div> <hr> <p>The doctors who work for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation say my problems aren't life threatening or even medical. All my blood and urine tests read normal, so they think my issues are mental, maybe caused by depression. </p> <p>In so many words, the doctors have called me a hypochondriac.</p> <p>I don't feel like a hypochondriac, though. Yeah, maybe I am a little depressed, but who in prison isn't? That's the nature of this place—it's sad. But it's also unhealthy: The prison largely serves and sells processed foods, and they keep us in cages. <br></p><p> How can I eat like this for over a decade, sleep on a thin mattress over a metal bunk, and still be healthy?</p> <p>Or maybe I <i> am</i> paranoid. I remember how it felt to walk past the poster in North Block, the one that had the faces of the men who died here from old age or natural causes, all within the same year. As I stood before them, noticing how young some were, I thought about what it would be like to die with the last thing I saw being prison bars, guards, and my failures.</p> <p>Any one of those men could have been me. I am 47, with at least another 13 years to serve. I, too, could die behind bars, alone, 3,000 miles from my family back home in New York.</p> <p>That’s why I need to know if I’m crazy or if medical is missing something. I need answers, whether for peace of mind or to save my life. But how do I get information from inside this system?</p> <p>I have complained about my slowly worsening health issues since 2003. With every new symptom, I file a request to see the doctor and jump through hoops to get an appointment. At least seven of them have said the same thing: I'm healthy. I don't believe it, though, because I don't trust the system to care about the quality of life of a man convicted of murder.</p> <p>I don't want to end up like the guy in West Block in 2015. They say he went to medical complaining of chest pains. He was sent back to his cell. Hours later, we heard he died of a heart attack. </p> <p>I also need to take care of myself to have some kind of quality of life on the outside. I want to go home able to make up for missing my sons’ whole lives—by being the best grandfather ever. I will teach my grandchildren how to play basketball while my boys take their wives to see Broadway shows I’ve bought them tickets to. I don't want to endure decades of miserable conditions just to die among strangers who don't care about me—or go home with a chronic condition just to be a continuing burden on my family. </p> <p>I saw on<i> Dr. Oz </i>that cleanses help, so I tried one with the only food I had access to that qualified: apples. For three days, I held up the line on the way out of the chow hall, stopping by the kitchen worker passing out the fruit. Ignoring strange looks from fellow inmates, I took away four apples at a time. </p> <p>I had to stretch out the apples through each day, watching the minutes tick by until my next scheduled snack. It was voluntary torture. At the two-and-a-half-day mark, they served hamburgers in the chow hall, and I decided to forget <i> Dr. Oz</i> and bite into some meat.</p> <p>I felt lighter after the two days of cleansing, but all my symptoms remained. Next, following my doctor's advice, I went to see the mental health department, hoping to rule out hypochondria.</p> <p>On the day of my appointment, I checked in with the officer at the desk.</p> <p>“Have a seat,&quot; he said.</p> <p>I went over to a knee-high metal bench and sat in a room packed with men. I thought to myself, <i> Damn, there are a lot of people seeking mental health help in here… </i>I felt like I was at the DMV.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"> <iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/wjzxq9/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-in-prison?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=ne43gz&site=vice\"></iframe> </div> <p>After about 15 minutes, an older lady with short hair and brown eyes called my name. I followed her through a maze of corridors to a small office, where she signaled me to sit in one of two chairs. </p> <p>&quot;So your doctor referred you here,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;Yeah, they think I'm a hypochondriac.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Why do they think that?&quot;</p> <p>I told her. We talked for about 30 minutes.</p> <p>She asked about my family, my job, my general feelings and my odds of going home. I told her that my mother just visited in July, my writing career was going well, and, with upcoming changes in the law, I could be home earlier than expected. My only complaint was being incarcerated. </p> <p>She said it sounded like I had a mild case of depression. She advised coming back to mental health to see someone on a regular basis. </p> <p>I agreed, albeit while disappointed that getting to the bottom of this wouldn't happen in a day, and headed back to my cell.</p> <p>&quot;What they say at mental health?&quot; Jay asked.</p> <p>&quot;They said I'm not crazy.&quot;</p> <p>Jay laughed and said, &quot;I guess you have to use the bathroom.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;My doctor says it's normal,&quot; I replied, and we both laughed. </p> <p>The next day, after jumping down off my bunk, I noticed that the bottom of my left foot hurt. I sat down on the toilet, took off my sock and looked at it, and saw a purple growth under the skin.</p> <p>This time I didn't report the problem.</p> <p><i>Rahsaan Thomas is a 47-year-old inmate at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin, California.

The paintings depict near-constant conflict, with culled-from-the-headlines <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7x94nq/viral-black-death-to-watch-or-not-to-watch\" target=\"_blank\">imagery recalling brutal police interactions</a>. These frenzied works bombard viewers with disjointed and sometimes contradictory suggestions, creating a visual language that’s as endless and overwhelming as scrolling through Twitter. </p> <p>The paintings in <i>Safe House</i> at Mary Boone were the antidote. Their figures—all black, as opposed to the interracial brawlers of <i>Seized</i>—engage in leisure and domestic activities. They depict black life as it exists outside of the headlines. And as <i>Seized</i> used the visual language of the social media era, <i>Safe House </i>drew on another medium particular to its time: occupational safety posters from the 1960s. Though the specter of postwar American supremacy is most fawningly invoked by those who would make the country great again, by adapting the posters and turning them into vehicles for black joy, Abney was re-appropriating conservative nostalgia.</p> <div> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"> <img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284137521-charlie-rubin-9025.jpeg\"> </picture> <div> The author (left) and artist Nina Chanel Abney (right) at Mary Boone Gallery</div> </div> <p>Abney has never shied away from politics. Her first major work, which earned her gallery representation, was a race-swapped group portrait of her Parsons School of Design MFA graduating class, in which she was the lone black student. She painted her classmates as black prison inmates, with Abney herself as their blond, white guard. But as political tensions have heightened, impelling artists and public figures of all kinds to frequent and direct political messaging, Abney now takes a more oblique approach to social commentary, raising countless questions and answering almost none of them. It’s both fascinating and infuriating. In a time that’s left us begging for guidance and certainty, Abney offers only a mirror. </p> <p>VICE visited <i>Seized the Imagination </i>and <i>Safe House</i> with Abney late last year to discuss race, painting politics, and creating a visual language for the emoji era. </p> <div> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 53.125em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 65.625em)\"> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 65.625em)\"> <img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513284206150-charlie-rubin-8875.jpeg\"> </picture> <div>Nina Chanel Abney, <i>Untitled, </i>2017.

Photo courtesy of the Kramers</div> </div> <p> <b>VICE: What was a typical day like in the wards? Was it fun? Were you bored?</b><br> <b>Laurie Kramer:</b> You get up and change into clothes for the day, and then you make your bed, and then you have breakfast. Then there would be group therapy for a couple hours, and then you'd have lunch, and then you'd have more group therapy.<br><br>The second time, I didn't go to the group therapies. It wasn't really part of it. The ward was run differently, and attendance wasn't mandatory. I preferred that one because I hated group therapy. I didn't want to listen to all these people prattling.<br><br>At the second hospital, they had an arts-and-crafts room and a stationary bicycle. That would be the &quot;fun time.&quot; But I was very, very bored all the time.<br><br> <b>Could you leave any time you wanted? If not, when and how did you or the doctors know you were better enough to be released?<br></b>No, I couldn't. I was on a locked ward both times. You can't walk out until they clear you.<br><br>The first time, I was encouraged to attend the group therapy sessions. You got points for doing stuff, and going to the session got you points. And you wanted those points because they were what got you out.<br><br>The first stay, I really hated being there and wanted to get out. I think I did a pretty good job of explaining myself to the psychiatrist why I was ready to go. And I was a lot better, actually.<br><br>What eventually cured me, and has kept me sane for ten years now, is one particular anti-psychotic medication. Some day soon, genetic testing is going to make prescribing medications a lot easier, but for now it's just trial and error with dosage. Now I take two antidepressants and two anti-psychotics and that works for me. I took lithium for a while, but that had side effects that were pretty untenable.<br><br>While I was sick, I was seeing my psychiatrist once or twice a week. Then, after all that, I would see them every few weeks. Now, just every few months to check in.</p> <p> <b> Were you given shock therapy? If so, what does it feel like and do you think </b> <b>it helped?</b><br>I got ECT [electroconvulsive therapy] three times a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I had it for a couple weeks after I got out of the hospital, too.<br><br>You'd get on a bus and go across the street to this facility for day procedures. There were about six to eight of us who would go. You get changed and go lie down on a table. The anesthetist comes first and knocks you out, and then the psychiatrist comes and applies the electricity to your head. Out cold the whole time. No pain, no nothing.<br><br>Waking up, I was confused. And the more ECT I had, the more confused I would be.<br><br>It didn't help. It turns out, the first week, they gave me anti-seizure meds, which they sometimes used for psychiatric problems. And that was preventing me from having a seizure, which is the goal of ECT, to induce a seizure.<br><br> <b> Were you ever in a straightjacket or padded cell?</b><br>No, but, at one point, I was put in four-point restraints. But I'll let my husband explain it because I don't remember any of it.<br><br>[<i>Laurie's husband, Phillip, enters the conversation.</i>]<br><br> <b>Phillip Kramer:</b> They called to tell me that she was quite agitated and they had her restrained and wanted to know if I wanted to come in. I'm a physician, so I did want to come in, which they seemed surprised by. By the time I got there, they only had her restrained at three points, allowing her one arm to be free. But she was still very agitated.<br><br>The room was not padded, though. It's essentially a comfortable bed with straps for the limbs. I've ordered that for a patient in the regular hospital. We try not to do that and there's all kinds of rules about it, but that's the closest thing to padded rooms these days.</p> <p> <b> Did you ever swap meds with other patients or pretend to swallow your pills to trick a nurse?</b><br> <b>Laurie Kramer:</b> Never did or saw anything like that. You have to do it in front of the nurses, and they watch you take it. I wasn't aware of anyone trying to stash it in their cheeks.</p> <p> <b> How severe were the other patients' conditions? Did you ever feel unsafe around them?</b><br> Some of the people there were quite sick. I wasn't well myself but... There were a lot of different characters, both times. There was one woman who was clearly psychotic.<br> <b>Phillip Kramer: </b>At the first hospital, the people I saw there, at any given time they seemed normal and could have a conversation with you. At the second hospital, you instantly knew something was wrong with them. They were in a different state and clearly mentally ill.<br> <b>Laurie Kramer:</b> I was too, though. I was much sicker that second time. I was having the ECT, which causes confusion. I don't know if I was ever psychotic, but I was delusional. I thought &quot;they&quot; were out to get me.</p> <p> <b>Were you able to make friends? </b><br>It was tricky. A lot of the other people in that ward weren't—how to put this—as smart as I am. The first time, I made friends with two or three of the women, and we really hit it off and were sort of a little clique there for the week.<br><br>The second time, I didn't really have someone I could call my friend. There were long days then.<br><br> <b>Were there any lucid moments where you were able to see how your sanity was slipping or see the illness from a different perspective?<br></b>There was one time where I'd come back from ECT, and I was convinced it was doing nothing for me. I called Phillip and was screaming to him about how it wasn't helping, et cetera, and one of the nurses told me, &quot;I don't like the way you talk to your husband.&quot; And it kinda hit me. This wasn't acceptable.<br> <b><br> Were the orderlies or doctors ever abusive?<br></b>I haven't seen <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>, but I know enough about it to say that there was no abuse like that at all. The nurses and other practitioners I saw were pretty nice and understanding.</p> <p> <b>How do people react when they hear you've stayed in a mental hospital?</b><br>That's hard to say. Our friends know it. <br> <b>Phillip Kramer:</b> It's not as if anyone stopped being our friends or anything. You usually don't tell someone something like this until they've known you a while and, the fact is, Laurie is a perfectly normal so their reactions, if they even have any, are of surprise. <i><br></i> </p> <p> <i>Follow Justin Caffier on </i> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinCaffier\" target=\"_blank\"> <i>Twitter.</i> </a><br></p>",

Just after she left her house last Saturday, she came across an abnormally large dookie by the passenger side of her car. Figuring some mammoth dog might be to blame, she and her fiancé checked their security footage to try to track down the beastly pooch behind the poop.</p><p>&quot;When we did, we found it was not a dog,&quot; Mattzela told FOX 16. &quot;It was a person who had been jogging down the street, ran up between our two cars, defecated, and ran away.&quot;</p><div data-embed-id=\"1515105473131\"><iframe width=\"640\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://w3.cdn.anvato.net/player/prod/v3/anvload.html?key=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\" height=\"360\"></iframe></div><p>Just a few days later, the mysterious jogger struck again.

        "content": "<p>We open on quick cuts of a crowded Los Angeles street packed with women in low-rise<br> Abercrombie &amp; Fitch jeans and skimpy halter-tops. There are no men on the street—like, not even one. Each shopping bag–toting woman is transfixed on one thing: Turtle, the round and fluffy dirtbag catcalling women and grazing their midriffs with his slimy hands. One car full of girls slows down to watch this majestic creature float into a restaurant with the grace of a sewer rat.</p> <p>Played by Jerry Ferrara, Turtle is one of the four charming protagonists in HBO’s hit show<br> <i> Entourage</i>. The show debuted in 2004 and churned out eight seasons, as well as a nostalgia-filled feature film in 2015. For years, the show was the pinnacle of bro life and masculinity, and was hailed as must-see television for men. As a 2000s kid, I admittedly felt a twinge of sentimentality watching digital cameras and flip-phones flourish in the pilot. But as a gay woman breathing air in 2017, I found the toxic masculinity, homophobia, blatant misogyny, and aggressive rape culture to be gutting. </p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTrTGQvp7EE\" data-iframely-id=\"tWLRRUs\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/tWLRRUs?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>In the show’s first episode, there isn’t one fully dressed woman who speaks of anything besides insisting on being undressed further. This is the story of Entourage: While we loosely follow protagonist Vincent Chase (played by Adrian Grenier) pursuing fame and fortune, we’re mostly just watching four men hit on girls and “live the life.” In this show, the actual “business” is as unimportant as the women.</p> <p>Turtle swaggers into a restaurant and joins Vince, Vince’s brother Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon), and Vince’s best friend Eric, or “E” (Kevin Connolly). Two model-like women strut by and ask why they’re not invited to Vince’s movie premiere. Turtle quips, “Because you’re not hot enough.” Instead of being offended or disgusted by this crown jewel, they smile and effusively coo, “Good luck! Call us!”</p> <p>They call E’s ex-girlfriend a “bitch.” They talk about Warren Beatty’s dick size (but not in a gay way). At Vince’s red carpet premiere, Turtle yelps, “Check out the tits on the girl from <i>Extra</i>.” Women are constantly and obsequiously begging our protagonists to grace them with their four-inch dicks. After Turtle serves his duty on “ass patrol,” the bros take a group of women back to Vince’s mansion to swim in lingerie. </p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://sports.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/nzpxvz/is-ballers-just-a-lesser-sports-version-of-entourage?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=gywje4&site=vice\"></iframe></div> <p>Each man secures his takedown, but Turtle pleads with his girl, “C’mon, what I gotta do to get a little?” He reminds her that Vince has already disappeared with two other women and adds, “C’mon, let’s make out a little, and I’ll show you where Vince eats breakfast.” Given the current deluge of women outing predators, harassers, and rapists, it felt especially harrowing to watch our four “lovable” dudes freely coerce women into performing sexual favors that they don’t feel comfortable doing. In this show, not only are women objects robbed of personalities, they’re also prizes meant to be won or conquered. (Sexual assault is sometimes even reduced to a punchline: The next morning, while the dudes compare war stories, Turtle jokes about juggling his girl’s “speed bags” while she told him about the time her uncle touched her in the shower.)</p> <p>Outside of treating women like garbage, the catalyst of this show is coolness. “Cool” is a currency in <i> Entourage</i>, and everyone’s trying to siphon it off one another. They hit golf balls off the roof, play basketball together, dress Turtle up in hockey gear and sic a foaming-at-the-mouth Rottweiler at him. There’s no shortage of evidence that these are cool, tough men. Vince is so noncommittal and chill that he doesn’t even care about his life or career. He demands that E make his decisions so he won’t have to (and later in the season, E becomes his manager).</p> <p>There are real repercussions to television that brandish rape culture like a war medal—just ask Jeremy Piven, who played Vince’s vulgar and predatory agent, Ari Gold. For years, Piven and <i> Entourage</i>’s millions of male viewers were told this behavior was not only kosher—it was something to strive for. Late last year, Piven was accused of <a href=\"http://people.com/tv/jeremy-piven-accused-sexual-assault-tiffany-bacon-scourby/\" target=\"_blank\">several alleged sexual assaults</a>. If you’re still scratching your head as to why so many men think they can get away with serially harassing and assaulting women, <i> Entourage</i> is one of many examples to look toward.</p>",

        "content": "<p><i>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca\" target=\"_blank\">VICE Canada</a></i>.<br><br>Growing up in Vancouver, we never had snow days—it was never even cold enough for me to own a parka. The ocean generally keeps the city's temperatures from getting too hot or too cold, though in recent years <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/when-vancouver-had-winter-1.3918910\" target=\"_blank\">things have gotten a little kooky out there</a>. </p> <p>Moving to Toronto was my first experience with a true Canadian winter. I came straight here from Guatemala, where I’d been traveling, so I got out of Pearson airport wearing only flip-flops. I’d lost my actual shoes on the last leg of the trip. It was mid January, and around negative 13 degrees with the windchill. Within a couple of minutes walking outside, my feet began to hurt. I almost stopped to take a photo of them in the snow, but I was genuinely concerned I was going to get frostbite. My toes burned for a week every time I took a shower. </p> <p>Although I found Toronto to be pretty cold at times, I noticed that wasn’t a sentiment I could express without getting an unreasonable amount of bitter snark in return.</p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/jana_pruden/status/688860586302517249\" data-iframely-id=\"Lq5lC06\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/Lq5lC06?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><i>“You think THIS is cold? Try living in Ottawa. It’s negative 40.” </i></p> <p><i>“Winnipeg is literally colder than Mars right now.” </i></p> <p><i>“It’s snowing, so everyone in Toronto has forgotten how to drive.” </i></p> <p>You get the idea. </p> <p>This tendency to one-up one another based on how cold our respective hometowns are is uniquely Canadian. It’s like the weather version of a dick-measuring contest, and, until recently, I thought it was pretty fucking weird. Like, why are you bragging about how cold it is where you live? Being cold sucks. I would take Vancouver winters back any day, and calling me a little bitch baby won’t change my views on that. </p> <p>But the past couple weeks, I’ve found myself cold-shaming others—namely, Americans who are seemingly just realizing that winter is cold. I spent the holidays in New York, and it was chilly, but nowhere near cold enough to warrant the level of hype I heard. <br> <br> “It’s dangerously cold outside,” my friend, who lives in Brooklyn, texted me on a day that was 24 degrees, using it as an excuse not to go out that night. Twenty-four degrees is not even North Face jacket weather. You could still go for a run in 24 degrees if you’re one of those performative fitness weirdos who do things like run outside. I swear there are some older Canadian men who would wear shorts in 24-degree weather. </p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3n7gz/why-the-fuck-is-it-so-cold\" data-iframely-id=\"9DKCDQ6\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/9DKCDQ6?summary=true&amp;app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>Then there was New Year’s Eve, which saw New York City drop to ten degrees—the second-coldest ball drop ever, apparently. That’s not even a temperature most Canadians would think is worthy of screenshotting and posting on Twitter. Up here, we’re familiar with terms like “polar vortex,” and there are <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ice-storm-ottawa-20-years-later-1.4470067\" target=\"_blank\">20-year-anniversary stories</a> about ice storms that left people without power for weeks. So you can understand why watching Anderson Cooper lay out his heated balaclava before going live from Times Square and reading headlines like “<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/2018/01/02/deadly-cold-grips-swath-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">Deadly, Bone-Chilling Cold Grips Wide Swath of United States</a>” feels a tad dramatic. Also, maybe y’all are handling this poorly because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhylLew_asdf/status/947823184245678080\" target=\"_blank\">this is what you’re being advised to wear</a> when it’s “cold AF.” </p> <p>To be fair, it has been fucking freezing in parts of the US—Duluth, Minnesota, was around negative 43 degrees last week. (We’re with you, Duluth.) </p><div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaleighrogers/status/948664230391308289\" data-iframely-id=\"weKJomS\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/weKJomS?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>But just when I start to feel sorry for you, I check my weather app, compare New York’s weather “advisory”* with Toronto’s “extreme cold warning,” and my empathy disappears. Allow me to cold-splain for a moment—an advisory or alert isn’t really shit. If you see a warning, that’s when you should start to be worried. </p> <p>All this said, I think I’m starting to see the appeal of Canadians’ winter superiority complex—there’s not really any other upside to four months of absolute crap weather. And if you live in a city like Winnipeg or Ottawa that regularly gets dogged, maybe your winter “cred” is all you have over places like Toronto and Vancouver. </p> <p>I’ve never been good at winter sports, but cold-shaming is one I can get into.</p> <p><i> *I just checked the weather app, and sorry, New York, that does look like a pretty shitty blizzard!

        "content": "<p>For those who follow the White House the way more balanced people follow Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the past few days have been the equivalent of a blockbuster. A new <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/vby3pj/12-shocking-things-from-that-book-about-trumps-white-house\" target=\"_blank\">gossip-filled book</a> from journalist Michael Wolff, <i>Fire and Fury</i>, appeared from the ether like a late Christmas gift to Donald Trump's many haters. Going by initial excerpts in <i>New York </i>and British <i>GQ, </i>it portrays Trump as an addled narcissist and describes his inner circle as a bunch of self-interested dolts <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3n788/nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\">convinced he would lose</a> the 2016 election. And, in what might be its biggest bombshell, it features former White House adviser Steve Bannon <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/steve-bannon-called-the-trump-tower-meeting-treasonous-trump-lose-mind/\" target=\"_blank\">describing a meeting</a> Donald Trump Jr. took with a Russian lawyer as &quot;treasonous&quot; and &quot;bad shit.&quot;</p><p>Predictably, these comments drew the wrath of Trump, who promptly insisted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/948619779790827520/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.motherjones.com%2Fpolitics%2F2018%2F01%2Fsteve-bannon-called-the-trump-tower-meeting-treasonous-trump-lose-mind%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Bannon</a> &quot;lost his mind.&quot; Trump's lawyers have since accused Bannon of breaking a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3n74g/trumps-war-with-bannon-just-turned-into-a-legal-fight\" target=\"_blank\">nondisclosure agreement</a> and <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/3k5v4b/trump-threatens-to-sue-fire-and-fury-publisher-to-stop-the-books-release\" target=\"_blank\">even threatened to sue</a> Wolff's publisher. Bannon responded by saying on Twitter that his words were &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKBannon/status/948609554270564354\" target=\"_blank\">taken out of context</a>&quot; and <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d34dyq/bannon-radio-show-trump-breitbart\" target=\"_blank\">reaffirmed his support</a> for the president he helped elect, a man he called &quot;the great white hope for the USA.&quot; (Trump on Thursday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/politics/donald-trump-steve-bannon-praise/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledged</a> his wayward acolyte's mea culpa without explicitly accepting it.) </p><p>Bannon's remarks also set off a wave of commentary—is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/opinions/steve-bannon-may-just-be-right-louis/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">he right</a> to suggest the Russia probe might end in even more prosecutions? Is he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/steve-bannon-trump-bad-guy?CMP=twt_gu&__twitter_impression=true\" target=\"_blank\">actually not all that bad</a> of a guy?

Trump and Bannon (and Wolff) are naturals at ginning up controversy, so this bomb cyclone of a spat is naturally consuming a lot of oxygen in the media world. But it's important to pause between bites of popcorn to ask a different question: How much does Steve Bannon even matter at this point?</p><hr><div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/public-speaking-tips-from-donald-trump/59ee0f7d177dd41d0b730655\" data-iframely-id=\"RN62sL7\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/RN62sL7\"></iframe></div></div><hr><p>Bannon might argue that he's very, very important. He's spent an awful lot of time selling himself as a political prophet, if not quite a Sith Lord. &quot;Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steve-bannon-trump-tower-interview-trumps-strategist-plots-new-political-movement-948747\" target=\"_blank\">told Wolff in 2016</a> after Trump's victory during an interview in which he also said his new political movement would &quot;get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years&quot; if Trumpism—or Bannonism—could &quot;deliver.&quot;</p><div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/jpnabb/steve-bannons-sad-desperate-crusade?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=a3n788&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>At the time of that interview, Bannon's power was at its apex. The journalist Joshua Green's book <i>Devil's Bargain</i> has since described him as a sort of visionary, seeing a path to victory for Trump that no one else did. And it may be that he deserves some credit for embracing a scorched-earth strategy—a combination of economic populism and xenophobia with unhinged attacks on Hillary Clinton—that put a reality star in the White House. Certainly a lot of people, including many liberals, have given him the kind of man-behind-the-curtain attention he so obviously craves, with <i>SNL </i>going so far as to portray him as the Grim Reaper.</p><p>But since Trump's win, Bannon's record—and his portrayal in the press—has taken a nosedive. The most prominent candidate he's backed in a subsequent election, Roy Moore, managed to lose a Senate race in Alabama despite being on the Republican ticket. Similarly aggro Republicans <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/11/republicans_discover_there_is_no_trumpism_without_trump.html\" target=\"_blank\">also lost</a> in Virginia and New Jersey this past November. The crop of <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/04/roy-moore-may-have-lost-breitbart-s-steve-bannon-has-field-awful-candidates-ready-2018/218959\" target=\"_blank\">anti-establishment challengers</a> Bannon is currently supporting looks like a list of crackpots and literal ex-cons likely to flame out in general elections if any even get that far.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/13/steve-bannon-blamed-roy-moores-loss-alabama-senate/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategists and politicians</a> from the establishment wing of the Republican Party have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/12/republicans-blast-steve-bannon-after-roy-moores-al/\" target=\"_blank\">openly disparaging</a> Bannon since Moore lost, and more and more conservatives seem to be abandoning him. The billionaire Mercer family, whose hedge fund wealth has historically helped finance his many operations, have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/04/steve-bannon-reportedly-gets-cut-off-by-wealthy-backer-rebekah-mercer.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly dropped him</a>. (He may have a new benefactor, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/948931127867195393\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese billionaire</a> who has attacked his home country's corruption, which apparently makes him acceptable to a man who sees China as America's number-one threat.) On Thursday, right-wing media impresario Matt Drudge <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/matt-drudge-promises-breitbart-executives-but-not-steve-bannon-will-take-breitbart-into-the-fresh-future/article/2644966\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted compliments</a> about other Breitbart executives but not Bannon, a fairly obvious bit of shade. Even Alex Jones <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-turns-on-steve-bannon-it-looks-like-he-has-organ-failure\" target=\"_blank\">is going in</a>: The Infowars host said on Thursday that Bannon looks like “he has organ failure” and “has been run over by a truck with dandruff all over him.” </p><p>Without Trump and the Mercers in his corner, Bannon doesn't have nearly the same kind of access to levers of power. Among the Trump base, he may not be especially popular or well known, either: An <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us04042017_U423fmbh.pdf/\" target=\"_blank\">April poll</a> from Quinnipiac found that 61 percent of Republicans, and 51 percent of whites without a college degree, still didn't know enough about him to have an opinion. (In all, Bannon's favorability was at 11 percent.) That doesn't bode well for his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/bannon-for-president-trump-kushner-ivanka\" target=\"_blank\">supposed political ambitions</a>. </p><p>If Bannon is not forced out at Breitbart, a move the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/breitbart-owners-debate-ousting-bannon-amid-trump-feud-1515100110\" target=\"_blank\">company's board</a> is apparently debating<b>,</b> he'll be able to play some role in shaping the conversation on the hard right. But that website's vitriol hasn't proved effective at influencing policy or elections by itself—and with Bannon in Trump's doghouse, that doesn't seem likely to change. He'll pop up now and again in the news, because if there's one thing he's good at, it's appearing in headlines. But he's not the grim reaper anymore, if he ever was. He's just a guy with too many shirts. </p><p><i>Follow Harry Cheadle on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hcheadle\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</i> </p>",

        "content": "<p><i>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/43qn59/how-to-quit-everything-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\">VICE Canada</a></i>.<br><br>“New year, new me” is one of those lies we tell ourselves like “my parents did the best they could’’ or “wearing sweatpants in public is acceptable.” I should know, because I usually made it to about January 9 before I was up to my neck in deep-fried ice cream covered in Jack Daniels with my new gym membership on fire in a paper shredder. But I’ve learned that beating an addiction is not impossible. In 2009, I was a 240-pound, alcoholic cocaine addict who lived in my mom’s basement. I fully expected my addictions to kill me before I turned 30. And they almost did. </p> <p>In 2015, I drank heavily nearly every day and had a cocaine relapse after going two years without it. I smoked weed every day. I also did Oxycontin, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and—considering what dealers are known to cut drugs with—probably a fair bit of battery acid too. In between, I was drinking five cups of coffee and going through a pack of smokes to keep me standing. Add in a McDonald’s meal with a side of porn before I’d call it a night, all paid for with credit cards. In December of that year, I was diagnosed with my second bout of pancreatitis one week before my 29 birthday. Since that day, two years ago, I haven’t had a single drink. After some relapses, I haven’t done hard drugs in over a year. </p> <p>Nine months ago, I started a podcast called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/alex-wood-quits-everything/id1229292185?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Wood Quits Everything</a>, which has seen me also quit weed, caffeine, biting my nails, cigarettes, red meat, dairy, porn, credit cards, and gossip. The last three items on my list for the podcast are sugar, social media, and my smartphone. I’ve learned through my experiences and interviewing drug, food, shopping, porn, gambling, cigarette, and anger addicts for my podcast that everyone’s path to quitting an addiction is different. The advice I have to offer is simply what has worked for me. My hope for anyone reading this is that they can take something from that. <br></p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb794j/holes-drummer-shares-her-brutally-honest-tale-of-90s-grunge-and-addiction\" data-iframely-id=\"IVAtp0E\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/IVAtp0E?summary=true&amp;app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>The first addiction I ever quit was cocaine. I was 22 years old. I had been doing coke recreationally (which is a hilarious term for drug use—it sounds like I was in a bowling league where we do cocaine) for a few years. I was asked to perform at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal—a dream come true for any Canadian comedian. It lit a fire under me to reach for the stars and throw off the shackles of my… OK, that didn’t happen. It lit a fire under aluminum foil, and I reached for cocaine to try freebasing it. Over the next few months, I spent every dime I had on cocaine. As it turns out, cocaine costs more than a few dimes. So I also racked up a $1,100 debt to a drug dealer. One night, I ended up throwing up on-stage from withdrawal sickness, and a week later my nose exploded with blood right before I was to go on-stage. It felt like I was in the last 25 minutes of the movie <i> Blow</i> if Johnny Depp lived with his mom and never got laid. </p> <p>I went cold turkey. I borrowed money from a friend to pay off the dealer because I was pretty attached to my unbroken legs. I didn’t leave my mom’s basement for over a month and cried myself to sleep every single night. I contemplated suicide. I had felt nothing but emptiness and depression for that entire time. Until one day, Miley Cyrus saved me. I had just got out of the shower and heard a beautiful guitar riff coming from the other room where I had left the television on. It immediately made me feel good. Wearing only a towel, I hurried into the room to see what angels had brought me this sweet gift. When I saw Miley Cyrus singing “Party in the USA” on the television, I burst into laughter. It was the first time I had laughed in over a month. When I realized I was in a towel laughing hysterically at a Miley Cyrus music video, it made me laugh harder. It was the first time I felt like I might be OK. I wish it was someone cooler like Kanye West or Lou Reed, but we play the cards we’re dealt. I went two years without cocaine after that day before relapsing for an entire summer. Then I relapsed again in 2015 at a strip club in Montreal.</p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"> <iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/3knkz3/america-has-been-trying-to-get-sober-for-over-300-years?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=43qn59&site=vice\"></iframe> </div> <p>That year, 2015, was one to forget, and I can't remember it anyway. I drank almost every day. I relapsed on cocaine. I did MDMA so much that I actually started liking house music. I took more mushrooms than Super Mario. I ate so much pizza that the pizza place next door actually named a pizza after me (to be honest, still kind of proud of that one). I would have put my penis inside of a toaster oven if I thought it would make me forget about my ex-girlfriend. If there weren’t any household appliances at my disposal, I would settle for porn. I was a mess. In May of that year, I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I was given a month of antibiotics and told to quit drinking for a year at least. I thought my zero years of med school stacked up well against my doctor’s education, so I quit for a month instead. I would be diagnosed with pancreatitis again in December of that year. A trip to the emergency room with an alcohol withdrawal seizure would finally get through to me that I needed a change (and a change of underwear because I pissed my pants). </p> <p>Once I decided that I really did want to quit drugs and alcohol for good this time, my first step was to get motivated. My primary motivation was my health and to transform my life for the better. I was sick and tired of being hungover, of being flat broke, and of hurting my family. I realized that my whole life revolved around my addictions. Every decision I made was based on how it would affect getting my fixes. </p> <p>I wasn’t born addicted to drugs and alcohol. I rewired my brain to become that way. So I thought it stood to reason that if I rewired my brain into this mess,<a href=\"https://www.altamirarecovery.com/blog/the-brain-that-heals-itself-neuroplasticity-and-promise-for-addiction-treatment/\" target=\"_blank\"> I could rewire it out of it</a>. You have to believe that you can, too. Personally, I looked to inspirational figures to give me motivation. Think of Terry Fox: He ran a marathon every single day for 143 days—with cancer, on one leg. At first, he wasn’t getting the donations or attention for his cause as he had hoped. But he kept running every single day. He’s now remembered as a Canadian icon, with over $650 million dollars raised for cancer in his name. He was a human, just like you and me. If he can do that, you can quit something that’s hurting you. </p> <p>Now that I was thinking positively, it was time to put that motivation into action. The first thing I did was tell my family and friends. For a control freak like myself, it was important for me to recognize I couldn’t do this on my own. I was going to need their support. Control is also a concept I had to get a firmer grasp on. I had to learn how to control myself and my reactions to the things that happened to me. January 1, 2016, was a big moment for me. I was 12 days off of alcohol. I made it through the shakes, delirium tremens, my birthday, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve without drinking. Then I lost my wallet on the subway. </p><p>I was consumed with rage and had planned to grab a drink as soon as I could. That’s when I had an epiphany that if I went and got drunk my wallet would still be lost. I would just be drunk with a lost wallet. It was a huge moment in my recovery and one that I still remind myself of constantly. Drinking, getting high, overeating, or smoking won’t make my problems go away. It may temporarily numb the pain or anger of something bad happening to me, but then I’m left the next day with the same problems and a hangover. Only I can make my problems go away. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was learning how to play the tape out. </p> <p>Playing the tape out means when you have a craving for the vice you want to quit; don’t get stuck in the craving part of thinking about it. Continue past that to how you will feel after you have done it. I learned to do this when I quit cocaine (the first time). I realized when I had a craving my only thought would be, <i>It would feel so good to get high</i>. I was fighting against a mounting tidal wave of these thoughts before one day I simply thought, <i>What happens after I get high</i>? Sure, it would feel good to get high, but it means I also spent money when I already owed a drug dealer $1,100. The high wouldn’t last very long. And then I’d be left feeling guilty and depressed.</p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59z7nz/a-father-son-trip-to-alcoholics-anonymous\" data-iframely-id=\"JbsU7tM\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/JbsU7tM?summary=true&amp;app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>Everything I had learned about addiction gave me an idea last year: I would quit the rest of my negative addictions and make a podcast about it. Quitting porn is the one I’ve been asked about the most. When people asked me if I was addicted to porn, and I said yes, I could read a look on their face like, “This guy must masturbate at weird times and weirder places.” It’s been oddly rewarding. It’s made sex even more pleasurable. I’m even more connected now, and I’m not picturing my partner as a naughty librarian who also happens to be dating my father. I probably only masturbate two times a week now—far healthier than my previous number, which more closely resembled an NBA player’s average points per game. </p> <p>Quitting dairy and red meat really made me realize that food can be just like a drug. I will use it to celebrate, I will use it to numb pain, I will use it when I’m bored, and I will spend money I should be using in better ways on it. Season four of <i> Narcos</i> could be set in a Pizza Hut, and I would be just as invested. I’ve also learned that vegans aren’t deluding themselves when they mention recipes that are just as good as the real thing. I used to think they had the credibility of Nigerian princes who needed your credit card info to give you a huge amount of cash. But my girlfriend just made me dairy-free chicken alfredo sauce last night, and it was the best I’ve ever had. Email me your credit card info, and I’ll give you the recipe. </p> <p>The last thing I realized is I shouldn’t be afraid to fail. Relapsing is part of addiction. The key is to not let your moments of weakness erase all of your hard work. If you were driving somewhere and you got off at the wrong exit, you wouldn’t give up on going to your destination. “I made a wrong turn, so time to turn the car off, throw the keys out the window, take off my clothes, and take a hot shit in the backseat because I now live in this car.” That obviously sounds ridiculous. So think of your addiction in the same way. I came back stronger after every relapse. </p> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_ca/video/fentanyl-the-drug-deadlier-than-heroin/57169d30dbb30e8656f09c76\" data-iframely-id=\"8zCXMy\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/8zCXMy\"></iframe></div></div> <p>Since sobriety, I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been physically and mentally. I paid off my credit card debt, and I have a savings account for the first time since my Hulk Hogan piggy bank. I’m in love, and it’s far and away the best relationship of my life. I’m a better listener, friend, brother, and son. My career has found new life, and after eight long years, I was asked to perform at Just for Laughs again this past summer for Kevin Hart’s LOL Network. </p> <p>Quitting addiction can sometimes feel easy and other times feel impossible. I’ve failed more than I’ve succeeded. For instance, I’m writing this on day three off sugar, and the withdrawal is making me a tiny bit angry. I know it’s difficult, but you can quit your addiction in 2018. If it ever seems too hard, or you stumble and relapse, have faith in yourself. You have more strength inside of you then you know, you just have to dig down deep to get it. And if all else fails, just throw on some Miley. </p><p><i>Follow Alex Wood on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/woodcomedy\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter.</a></i></p>",

        "content": "<p>Growing up in Kansas, photographer <a href=\"http://www.tarawray.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Tara Wray</a> developed an eye for finding the surreal in everyday life. &quot;I'd go for long walks alone or with my neighbor Grace, who was in her 80s, and I'd explore old limestone farmhouses looking for treasure,&quot; Wray said. &quot;I once saw a cat that was missing its lower jaw, and one time the sky went completely dark in the middle of the morning for no reason. I didn't always have a camera on me then. But I used to love to shoot disposable 35mm cameras. I’d send the film away through the mail and get back these little magical packages full of images.&quot;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/contributor/tara-wray\" target=\"_blank\">VICE contributor</a> spent her formative years taking care of her mentally unstable mother, as revealed in her 2006 documentary film <i> <a href=\"http://www.tarawray.net/815208-documentary-films#0\" target=\"_blank\">Manhattan, Kansas</a>, </i>which was an Audience Award winner that year at SXSW. It was a lonely and often painful existence, and the repercussions of her upbringing have haunted Wray into adulthood. She started college at 16, ran away to Finland in her early 20s, and eventually wound up studying writing and film at New York University in the early 2000s. “I moved to New York on August 31, 2001, and my first day working in the city was September 11.”</p> <p>In 2007, Wray and fellow filmmaker Josh Melrod left New York City and moved to Vermont to start shooting their documentary <i><a href=\"http://www.tarawray.net/cartooncollegemovie\" target=\"_blank\">Cartoon College</a></i>, which followed the lives of students at the <a href=\"http://www.cartoonstudies.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Cartoon Studies</a>, the nation's leading university for aspiring cartoonists and graphic novelists. Along the way, Wray turned her attention to photography, a creative medium that suits her solitary nature. &quot;I bring my camera with me everywhere I go, and if I’m paying attention, at some point I'll just start to see things that are obviously meant to be pictures,&quot; she said.</p> <div> <picture><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513961546916-1512510056838-Tara_Wray_1.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513961546916-1512510056838-Tara_Wray_1.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 25em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513961546916-1512510056838-Tara_Wray_1.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513961546916-1512510056838-Tara_Wray_1.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 40.625em)\"><source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513961546916-1512510056838-Tara_Wray_1.jpeg?resize=800:*\" media=\"(min-width: 40.625em)\"><img alt src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1513961546916-1512510056838-Tara_Wray_1.jpeg\"></picture> <div></div> </div> <p>Wray's work uniquely combines a documentary aesthetic with melancholy, sometimes grotesque, imagery and bizarre juxtapositions. Her latest endeavor is a hardcover photo book titled <i> Too Tired for Sunshine</i>, slated to be published in the spring of 2018 by <a href=\"http://www.yoffypress.com/catalog/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoffy Press</a>. </p> <div data-related-article=\"true\"><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/ywgbdy/stunning-photos-of-small-town-pennsylvania?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=qvz8nd&site=vice\"></iframe></div><p>The photographs, taken throughout the Vermont countryside during intermittent bouts of depression, are by turns gruesome and calming. Wray takes pictures of backyard slaughterhouses and snow squalls, roadkill, and languid farm dogs. The imagery gives the book an uncanny quality, while the matter-of-factness of Wray's vision conveys dark, almost subversive, humor. &quot;Many of these photos were shot on days when I wasn't sure I could get out of bed,&quot; Wray said. &quot;But they were my saving grace, and when I see them in the book I get a warm, bittersweet feeling, because I'm reminded not of depression but of how strange and how lovely the world can be.&quot;</p> <div> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1512510065587-Tara_Wray_2.jpeg?resize=400:*,

Peck <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/361452/museumgoer-breaks-a-kusama-pumpkin-allegedly-in-pursuit-of-a-selfie/\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> Hyperallergic that “a piece… sustained minor damage and the room was closed temporarily,” and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/arts/design/hirshhorn-museum-sculpture-damaged.html\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> to the <i>New York Times</i> that a guest “took an accidental misstep” from a small platform, damaging one of the spotted sculptures. </p> <p>Though a single similar Kusama sculpture <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.1061.html/2015/modern-contemporary-asian-art-evening-sale-hk0581\" target=\"_blank\">sold for nearly $800,000 in 2015</a>, Peck <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/selfie-smashes-kusama-pumpkin-hirshhorn-museum-873071\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> artnet that “the individual pumpkins within the <i>Infinity Room</i> hold no intrinsic value on their own,” explaining that the cost of replacing one pumpkin was “negligible.” A replacement pumpkin was sent for, and the room of gourds was back up and running the next day.</p> <h2>Thomas Gainsborough’s <i>The Morning Walk</i> </h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/843512546841759744\" data-iframely-id=\"xZSI1EG\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/xZSI1EG?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>In March, a wing of London’s National Gallery was evacuated after a man attacked a famous Thomas Gainsborough painting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/19/man-charged-damage-to-gainsborough-work-at-national-gallery-evacuation\" target=\"_blank\">with a drill bit</a>. Sixty-three-year-old Keith Gregory reportedly vandalized the English painter’s work, <i>The Morning Walk</i>, after he said voices in his head <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5166644/homeless-man-slashed-24m-gainsborough-painting-national-gallery-london-court/\" target=\"_blank\">told him</a> to “put a mark on the painting and your family will find you.”</p> <p>The 1785 painting, valued in the tens of millions, suffered around $13,500 of damage from two scratches, and was restored and reinstalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/28/gainsborough-painting-mr-mrs-william-hallett-morning-walk-restored-rehung-national-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">in ten days</a>.

A representative of the painting's owners later <a href=\"https://www.aspentimes.com/news/man-inexplicably-destoys-3-million-painting-in-aspen-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> through an attorney that the damage was “minimal,” though the lawyer did not say how much it cost to repair. </p> <p>The disguised art attacker has yet to be caught, with an Aspen police representative <a href=\"https://www.aspentimes.com/news/international-suspect-slows-aspen-police-in-slashed-painting-case/\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> in November that local cops were in the midst of an international investigation “dealing with sending search warrants from little ol' Aspen to Interpol.&quot;</p> <h2>Simon Birch’s <i>14th Factory</i> Crowns</h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsKyxf12QVo\" data-iframely-id=\"TRde1Kp\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/TRde1Kp?playerjs=true\"></iframe></div></div> <p>In July, a woman visiting British multimedia artist Simon Birch’s interdisciplinary exhibition <a href=\"https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/pae9xn/kubrick-room-14th-factory-150000-square-foot\" target=\"_blank\"> <i>The 14th Factory</i> </a> in Los Angeles lost her balance while taking appearing to take a selfie, <a href=\"https://creators.vice.com/en_au/article/kza9mw/selfie-destroys-200000-art-simon-birch\" target=\"_blank\">sending a series of pedestals carrying avant-garde crowns tumbling</a> in a domino affect.</p> <p>A clip of the incident, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsKyxf12QVo\" target=\"_blank\">uploaded to YouTube</a> by a man claiming to be a “mate” of Birch’s, has racked up more than 7 million views to date. </p> <p>Though some <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/culture/arts-entertainment/article/2102646/selfie-gone-wrong-or-stunt-simon-birch-artwork-topples-la\" target=\"_blank\">speculated</a> that the video could be a staged stunt for viral promotion of his exhibit, Birch told media that it was truly an unexpected accident, estimating the damage done to his art at about $200,000.</p> <h2>Jacques Newashish’s <i>La Femme De La Nuit Hibou</i></h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal/status/896043141987520512\" data-iframely-id=\"Hf3FSja\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/Hf3FSja?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>Last August, a wooden totem created to honor missing and murdered Indigenous women at Montreal’s First Peoples’ Festival was accidentally destroyed by a city employee. <a href=\"http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/artwork-at-first-peoples-festival-accidentally-destroyed-by-city-worker\" target=\"_blank\">According to</a> the <i>Montreal Gazette</i>, Atikamekw artist Jacques Newashish spent three days using a chainsaw and an axe to create a wooden sculpture titled <i>La Femme De La Nuit Hibou</i> (&quot;The Owl Night Woman&quot;), which he planned to eventually burn in a symbolic purification ceremony.</p> <p>A city worker assigned to clean up wood chips at the event, however, was reportedly ordered by a festival official to throw out the nearly finished totem along with the scraps. &quot;The fate of this artwork is ironic given the message that the artist wanted to send, emphasizing the injustice experienced by missing Indigenous women and affected families,&quot; Newashish's partner, Clode Jalette, said on Facebook. Festival organizers <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/indigenous-art-destroyed-montreal-1.4243230\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> the situation &quot;an unfortunate error&quot; and admitted that they &quot;should have been more vigilant.&quot;</p> <h2>Two original Warhols—and more</h2> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://twitter.com/VICE/status/946478372963708929\" data-iframely-id=\"A9XZV94\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/A9XZV94?app=1\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> <p>Just barely making the cut in time for this list, a Texas woman was <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xw4wp7/drunk-woman-allegedly-destroyed-trump-fundraisers-warhol-art-on-first-date-vgtrn\" target=\"_blank\">accused of destroying two original Andy Warhol paintings</a> in late December.

He says she then began defacing his high-end art collection, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2017/12/26/dallas-woman-tore-paintings-walls-threw-sculptures-lawyers-mansion-houston-police-say\" target=\"_blank\">pouring red wine</a> on two original Warhols, valued at $500,000, along with another expensive painting, and throwing two sculptures, valued at $20,000 each, across a room. Layman, who reportedly caused $300,000 worth of damage, was arrested on felony criminal mischief charges and released on a $30,000 bond. &quot;She also pulled a Renoir and a Monet off the wall,&quot; Buzbee told <a href=\"https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/sites/texaslawyer/2017/12/27/woman-accused-of-destroying-300k-worth-of-art-at-tony-buzbees-house/?slreturn=20171127184807\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Texas Lawyer</i></a>. &quot;Luckily those weren’t damaged.&quot;</p> <p><i> Follow Peter Slattery on </i> <i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterSlattery3\" target=\"_blank\"> Twitter</a></i><i>.</i> </p>",

He announced the effort as part of a larger package of proposed changes to the criminal justice system, including eliminating cash bail for low-level crimes.</p> <hr> <div data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/inside-americas-for-profit-bail-system/569e4845a53059873bd601c6\" data-iframely-id=\"WvL3aq\"><div data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"><iframe data-img=\"\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/WvL3aq\"></iframe></div></div> <hr> <p>New York is one of ten states where prosecutors can wait until a trial to turn over witness names and statements, grand-jury testimony, and other evidence known as discovery, which backs up criminal charges. In a front-page <i>New York Times</i> story this summer, the Marshall Project <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/08/07/undiscovered\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the practice gives prosecutors a strategic advantage, especially because the vast majority of cases never make it that far: More than 98 percent of New York felony arrests that end in conviction occur through a guilty plea, not a trial. Defendants often plead guilty without ever knowing the strength of the case against them.</p> <p>New York lawmakers have introduced bills to open up the process at least a dozen times in the last 25 years, but the measures have faced powerful opposition from the state’s district attorneys. Prosecutors argue that turning over details of witnesses puts them at risk for intimidation and worse.</p> <p>The District Attorneys Association of the State of New York and its president, Oneida County district attorney Scott McNamara, did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.</p> <p>John Schoeffel, staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, called Cuomo’s support “the biggest thing to happen on discovery reform in 40 years.” The state’s discovery law has not been significantly updated since 1979, and this is the first time Cuomo has come out publicly in support of revising them. In 2015, a New York State Bar Association <a href=\"https://www.legal-aid.org/media/217437/nysba_discovery_reform_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> called the current system “outdated and unfair.”</p> <p>As is typical for a State of the State address, the governor did not offer many specifics. A <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-unveils-22nd-proposal-2018-state-state-restoring-fairness-new-yorks-criminal\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> accompanying the speech said he intends to introduce legislation requiring prosecutors to turn over information, including exhibits, the identity and backgrounds of witnesses and search warrant information, in stages. That would happen within three months after a defendant is arraigned, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/nyregion/cuomo-ending-cash-bail-state-of-the-state.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Wednesday. </p> <p>The release also said the plan will take steps to protect witness safety.</p> <p>The measures are part of a larger proposed package of changes to the criminal justice system that include eliminating cash bail for misdemeanors and nonviolent felony charges, and speeding up the trial process. In New York City in particular, defendants can languish in jail for months and years waiting for their day in court.</p> <p>Cuomo’s support follows a trend toward more open discovery nationwide. Ohio broadened its laws in 2010. Traditionally more conservative states such as Texas and North Carolina have made sweeping changes to their discovery laws. And the American Bar Association, whose standards often serve as models for state laws, has convened a task force to update its criminal discovery standards for the first time in more than 20 years. </p> <p><i>A version of this article was originally published by the <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/11/21/43-states-suspend-licenses-for-unpaid-court-debt-but-that-could-change?ref=hp-1-111\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall Project</a>, a nonprofit news organization that covers the US criminal justice system.
