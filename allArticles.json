Most countries consider as illegal the<span> Israel</span>i settlements built in the territory which<span> Israel </span>captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>\n<p><span>Israel </span>disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>\n<p><span>Israel</span>i authorities were due to<span> approve </span>on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.</p>\n<p>There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian officials. The Palestinians say<span> Israel</span>i settlements in the<span> West </span><span>bank</span>, a key issue in peace talks, deny them a viable contiguous state.</p>\n<p>US-brokered peace talks between<span> Israel </span>and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by US President Donald Trump’s administration to restart them have shown little sign of progress.</p>\n<p>Asked about the construction plans, a US State Department official said there had been no change in policy on settlements and the<span> Israel</span>i government had made clear that going forward “its intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the president’s concerns into consideration.”</p>\n<p>“The US welcomes this. As the president has said repeatedly, the administration is firmly committed to pursuing a comprehensive peace between<span> Israel</span>is and Palestinians,” the US official said on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>The White House said on Monday US vice president Mike Pence will visit the region from January 20 to 23, embarking on a tour originally planned for December after Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of<span> Israel</span>.</p>\n<p>Pence will hold talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Jordan’s King Abdullah and <span>Israel</span>i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.</p>\n<p>Trump’s decision on Jerusalem and announcement in December that the US would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv enraged the Palestinians who said the US can no longer broker peace with<span> Israel</span>.</p>\n<p><em>(Reuters)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212416/israel-approve-hundreds-new-settler-homes-west-bank/\">Israel to Approve Hundreds of New Settler Homes in West Bank</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",

Yet, cash is inching back to the </span><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Zp9V2MR6szRwCwEuPjJIKK/Currency-in-circulation-at-90-of-level-before-note-ban.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>pre-note ban level.</span></a><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Bankers, though, argue that there is a definite shift towards digital transactions and, therefore, investing big in cash-dispensing machines doesn’t make sense. </span><span>“(The) ATM is a sunset technology now,” said Ashutosh Khajuria, executive director and chief financial officer of Federal Bank. “More and more people are gradually shifting towards digital money, and with the coming up of more payment solutions like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Google’s Tez, this shift will become more dramatic in the near future.”</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s another other sticky problem. Growth has also been hampered because the fee earned by banks and ATM deployers from machines hasn’t increased for six years,</span><span> even as costs have risen, said Sanjeev Patel, CEO of Tata Communications Payments Solutions, which runs the Indicash network of ATMs. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The interchange fee (the amount paid by one bank to the other when its customer uses the other bank’s ATM network) has been stuck at Rs15 for cash transactions and Rs5 for non-cash transactions since 2012,” Patel said.</span></p>\n<p><span>It takes anywhere between Rs5 lakh ($7,840) and Rs7 lakh to set up an ATM, depending on the location. This is apart from the monthly expense on rent,<strong> </strong>electricity, security, maintenance etc., which has risen over the years. </span></p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, since November 2014, the Reserve Bank of India has allowed lenders to charge even their own customers for ATM transactions over and above the five free ones. That has resulted in a decline in ATM activity, further squeezing banks’ and ATM firms’ profitability as they earn on a per-transaction basis. Typically, it takes anywhere between 100 and 150 transactions a day for an ATM to be profitable.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, most banks are now rationalising their ATM network, said Raj Narayan, head of banking and transit at AGS Transact Technologies, another firm<strong> </strong></span><span>that runs and manages ATMs. “Most lenders are burdened with a huge <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://qz.com/1166910/npa-crisis-indias-bad-loan-problem-ranks-among-the-worlds-worst/\" target=\"_blank\">pile up of bad loans</a>. So, they are taking a closer look at the cost structure and shutting down or relocating ATMs that are not profitable,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Still, these machines will remain deployed on a large scale in certain geographies, including the hinterlands, as digital banking is yet to catch up there.</p><img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&blog=39587363&post=1176175&subd=qzprod&ref=&feed=1\" height=\"1\">",

That trend continues with an as-of-now untitled horror anthology series from the macabre-centric Blumhouse Productions <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/hulu-blumhous-horror-anthology-1202658041/\">according to <em>Variety</em></a>. Rather than release an episode a week or all at once, they'll be released once a month for 12 months, starting this October. From the sounds of it, Hulu might be interested in targeting horror fans beyond this series.</p>\n<p>This month alone, Hulu <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/04/lost-is-now-streaming-on-hulu-after-leaving-netflix/\">has picked up</a> streaming rights to <em>Lost </em>and announced it'll stream old episodes of classic cartoon <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/04/hulu-is-resurrecting-animaniacs-and-streaming-previous-seasons/\"><em>Animaniacs</em></a> in addition to producing new ones. The streaming service also picked up a Golden Globe for its original show <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/07/golden-globes-2018-streaming-wins/\"><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em></a>. In its quest to pick up more subscribers, Hulu will have to start appealing to a wider base. Horror fans are plenty passionate, and if the right names are attached to this project, could help push Hulu beyond the current <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/09/hulu-boasts-17-million-subscribers/\">17 million</a> subscribers it currently enjoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Via: </strong><a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/hulu-orders-monthly-horror-anthology-since-that-soun-1821923225?\" target=\"_blank\">AV Club</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/hulu-blumhous-horror-anthology-1202658041/\" target=\"_blank\">Variety</a></p>",

Some surveys show services like Uber and Lyft actually add to the congestion in urban areas, with more cars on the road competing for the same amount of road space.</p>\n<p>To solve the problem, many are looking to the skies. After <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/01/06/ehang-184-drone/\">Ehang</a> captivated CES two years ago with its passenger drone, Uber put a stake in the clouds by publishing a white paper on airborne mobility solutions — essentially air taxis — in 2017. </p>\n<p>Most famously, Dubai is working with EHang to develop a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/06/19/dubai-autonomous-taxi-service-scheduled/\">drone taxi service</a> to take people (and a couple of pieces of luggage) along various fixed routes within the city. <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2018/01/10/bell-helicopter-passenger-drone/\">Read more...</a></p>More about <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/ces/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Ces</a>, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/uber/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Uber</a>, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/air-taxi/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Air Taxi</a>, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/ces-2018/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Ces 2018</a>, and <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/passenger-drone/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Passenger Drone</a><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Mashable/~4/SaCeFLjUbs0\" height=\"1\">",

The author of the book, Michael Wolff, disputed<span> Bannon</span>‘s account.</p>\n<p>“<span>Bannon </span>died of his own sword,” said Roger Stone, a long-time<span> Trump </span>friend. “A classic example of hubris and beginning to think you are smarter than the boss.”</p>\n<p>Wolff’s book, <em><span>Fire </span>and Fury: Inside the<span> Trump </span>White House</em>, characterised<span> Trump </span>as mentally unstable, inept and unprepared for the presidency.</p>\n<p><span>After </span>publication of the book last week, major Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer, who owns a stake in<span> <em>Breitbart</em></span>, issued a statement distancing herself<span> from</span><span> Bannon</span>, saying she did not support his “recent actions and statements.”</p>\n<p><strong>Supported Roy Moore</strong></p>\n<p><span>Bannon </span>joined<span> <em>Breitbart</em> </span>in 2012 and helped raise the profile of the<span> news </span>site, which he once called the platform for the so-called alt-right, a loose confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.</p>\n<p>“I’m proud of what the<span> Breitbart </span>team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class<span> news </span>platform,”<span> Bannon </span>said in a statement cited by<span> <em>Breitbart </em></span><em><span>News</span></em>.</p>\n<p><span>Bannon </span>did not immediately respond to a request for comment<span> from </span>Reuters.</p>\n<p><span><em>Breitbart</em> c</span>hief executive Larry Solov, in a statement on the organisation’s website, called<span> Bannon</span>“a valued part of our legacy.”</p>\n<p>“We will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish,” Solov said.</p>\n<p><span>After </span>leaving the White House in August,<span> Bannon </span>picked a fight with the Republican establishment that may have cost the party a US Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama.</p>\n<p>He supported Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in his primary fight against incumbent Luther Strange, who was backed by<span> Trump </span>and mainstream Republicans.</p>\n<p>Moore won the primary but lost to Democrat Doug Jones in December’s general election<span> after </span>Moore was accused of sexual misconduct against teenagers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/212330/bannon-steps-breitbart-news-drawing-fire-trump/\">Steve Bannon Steps Down From Breitbart News After Drawing Fire From Trump</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>",
