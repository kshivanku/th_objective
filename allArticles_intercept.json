        "content": "<p><u>Na tarde desta</u> terça (9), o perfil oficial da Federação Nacional dos Policiais Federais no Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FENAPEF/status/950741290790150145\">publicou um anúncio extraordinário</a>. O tom burocraticamente indiferente ocultava a importância da notícia. O tuíte, em essência, propunha dar à Polícia Federal e ao governo federal, ao qual se subordina, o poder de regular, controlar e até mesmo censurar conteúdo político na internet que seja considerado “falso”, e “punir” aqueles que o disseminarem. Esse novo poder atingiria postagens em mídias sociais e também sites inteiramente dedicados a tratar de política.</p>\n<p>“A Polícia Federal dará início nos próximos dias em Brasília às atividades de um grupo especial formado para combater notícias falsas durante o processo eleitoral”, dizia o tuíte oficial. E continuava: “A medida tem o objetivo de identificar e punir autores de ‘fake news’ contra ou a favor dos candidatos”. Autoridades policiais de alto escalão declararam aos veículos de mídia que o grupo de trabalho incluiria representantes da Justiça Eleitoral e membros do Ministério Público, embora <a href=\"http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,gilmar-monta-forca-tarefa-anti-fake-news,70002113877\">uma das figuras importantes do Judiciário</a> envolvidas na medida seja o altamente controverso ministro de direita do Supremo Tribunal Federal, Gilmar Mendes, que há muito tempo vem ofuscando os limites da autoridade judicial com seu ativismo político.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"pt\">Polícia Federal dará início nos próximos dias em Brasília às atividades de um grupo especial formado para combater notícias falsas durante o processo eleitoral.

Pelo menos até agora, o que a PF parece almejar é um dos mais extremos poderes imagináveis – o direito do governo de controlar e suprimir conteúdo político na internet durante uma eleição – sem que exista um arcabouço jurídico para definir os parâmetros dessa atuação e prover salvaguardas contra os abusos.</p>\n<p>Os proponentes desse novo programa de censura da internet sinalizaram que irão buscar apoio no Congresso para aprovar uma lei que autorize a censura e defina seu funcionamento. Mas é impossível prever com certeza se um Congresso disfuncional, em que a maioria dos membros enfrenta denúncias de corrupção, conseguirá aprovar uma nova estrutura legal antes das eleições.</p>\n<p>É significativo que esses policiais tenham se comprometido a implementar o programa de censura <em>mesmo que</em> nenhuma nova lei seja aprovada. Eles insistem que nenhuma legislação nova é necessária, e <a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/pf-cogita-uso-de-lei-da-ditadura-para-coibir-fake-news-nas-eleicoes-22257120\">fazem referência à Lei de Segurança Nacional, que é anterior à internet</a> e foi publicada em 1983 – ainda na vigência, portanto, da violenta ditadura militar, que limitava drasticamente a liberdade de expressão e com frequência prendia os dissidentes.</p>\n<p>O novo grupo de combate às “fake news” irá responder diretamente ao delegado Eugênio Ricas, diretor de Investigação e Combate ao Crime Organizado da Polícia Federal. Na segunda (8), ele<a href=\"https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/coluna-do-fraga/eleicoes-diretor-da-pf-defende-mudar-lei-para-combater-fake-news-08012018\"> alertou que</a>, na ausência de uma nova lei, será invocada a autoridade dessa que é uma das normas mais repressoras do período da ditadura, e que contém passagens deliberadamente vagas que, a seu entender, tipificariam como crime “espalhar boatos que causem pânico”. Ele, no entanto, reclamou que a legislação da época da ditadura é inadequada em parte por ser muito leniente, prevendo “apenas” a pena de “meses” na prisão para aqueles que disseminarem “fake news”, o que ele considera “uma pena muito branda”.</p>\n<p>A lei de 1983 foi usada pela ditadura para prender dissidentes, críticos e ativistas da democracia. Que se esteja agora considerando ressuscitar essa lei de censura do período ditatorial para regular e censurar a expressão política contemporânea na internet, em nome do combate às “fake news”, é profundamente simbólico do caráter tirânico e perigoso das investidas do governo nesse sentido.</p>\n<p>A memória da ditadura como ameaça iminente —<a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/pf-cogita-uso-de-lei-da-ditadura-para-coibir-fake-news-nas-eleicoes-22257120\"> usada por Ricas</a> em<a href=\"https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/coluna-do-fraga/eleicoes-diretor-da-pf-defende-mudar-lei-para-combater-fake-news-08012018\"> inúmeras entrevistas</a> dadas a diferentes<a href=\"https://www.gazetaonline.com.br/noticias/politica/2018/01/o-que-houve-nos-eua-pode-acontecer-aqui--diz-ricas-sobre-fake-news-1014113648.html\"> veículos de mídia</a> na última semana — tem como finalidade pressionar por leis que, dada a comparação, pareceriam alternativas melhores. “Talvez aproveitando esses projetos que estão tramitando”, sugeriu o policial ao R7, afirmando que o objetivo da nova lei seria “estabelecer primeiro até onde as pessoas podem ir”.</p>\n<h3>Projetos de lei na Câmara abrem brecha para censura</h3>\n<p>Existem dois projetos de lei que versam sobre publicações virtuais prontos para votação na Câmara dos Deputados. Um deles sugere mudanças no Marco Civil da Internet. A lei de 2014 exige que órgãos de investigação — como a Polícia Federal e o Ministério Público — precisem de um mandado judicial para ter acesso a dados de usuários da rede. E, por isso,<a href=\"http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/COMUNICACAO/456495-POLICIA-FEDERAL-ACREDITA-QUE-MARCO-CIVIL-DA-INTERNET-PODE-PREJUDICAR-INVESTIGACAO-CRIMINAL.html\"> foi alvo de críticas da Polícia Federal durante sua elaboração</a>.</p>\n<p>A<a href=\"http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/fichadetramitacao?idProposicao=1279451\"> nova proposta de lei</a>, da deputada Soraya Santos (PMDB-RJ), acaba com a obrigatoriedade da ordem judicial para levantar dados e conversas particulares dos internautas. E o artigo 23 do Marco Civil, que hoje reserva aos juízes a responsabilidade pela “garantia do sigilo das informações recebidas”, passaria a vigorar com o seguinte anexo:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Art. 23-A. A autoridade policial ou o Ministério Público, observado o disposto neste artigo, poderão requerer, ao responsável pela guarda, registros de conexão e registros de acesso a aplicações de internet, para instruir inquérito policial ou procedimento investigatório iniciados para apurar a prática de crimes contra a honra cometidos mediante conteúdo disponibilizado na internet.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Além disso, o projeto também prevê que uma pessoa com histórico criminal poderá requerer “a indisponibilização de conteúdo que ligue seu nome ou sua imagem a crime de que tenha sido absolvido”. E o provedor que não tirar o conteúdo do ar “estará sujeito à multa de R$ 50.000,00 (cinquenta mil reais), aplicada no dobro em caso de reincidência”.</p>\n<p>O segundo projeto de lei pronto para votação<a href=\"http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/fichadetramitacao?idProposicao=310391&ord=1\"> data de 2005</a>, quando foi proposto pelo senador Paulo Paim (PT-RS). Inicialmente, era uma proposta sobre tipificação de “crimes resultantes de discriminação e preconceito de raça, cor, etnia, religião ou origem”. Entretanto, novas propostas de lei foram anexadas ao longo dos anos, inclusive<a href=\"http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/fichadetramitacao?idProposicao=2150854\"> uma de setembro de 2017</a>, do deputado Assis Melo (PCdoB-RS), que tipifica crimes de ódio na internet.</p>\n<p>O que aparentemente é uma lei para defender minorias, na verdade, é uma janela para órgãos investigativos classificarem publicações como de “ódio”. Também é uma forma de obrigar as plataformas digitais a tirar o conteúdo do ar, porque passa a considerar os provedores como co-autores das publicações:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“§ 3º. Os provedores de informação, conteúdo e hospedagem respondem solidariamente com o autor direto do dano.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hoje, as plataformas de publicação só são responsabilizados “se,<a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm\"> após ordem judicial específica</a>, não tomar as providências”.</p>\n<p>Comprovando que o objetivo não é, de fato, punir a opressão das minorias, leis já existentes sobre crimes de ódio têm penas até maiores do que as propostas, como a<a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l7716.htm\"> lei que criminaliza o racismo</a> e a<a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2004-2006/2006/lei/l11340.htm\"> lei Maria da Penha</a>. Segundo a ONG Safer Net Brasil, não apenas estamos falando de crimes já tipificados como, na prática, o projeto até<a href=\"http://www.huffpostbrasil.com/safernet-brasil/deputados-ainda-nao-desistiram-da-ideia-de-censurar-a-internet_a_23310818/\"> reduziria a pena máxima para esses crimes cinco para três anos</a>.</p>\n<p>O pesquisador Daniel Arnaudo, do Instituto de Política Internacional da Universidade de Washington, é autor de um estudo publicado no ano passado, que previa a influência de Temer para<a href=\"https://igarape.org.br/marcocivil/pt/\"> afastar a sociedade civil do processo de monitoramento da rede</a>.</p>\n<p>Em entrevista ao The Intercept Brasil, Arnaudo afirma que o princípio de governança colaborativa, tão elogiado durante criação do Marco Civil, está em risco atualmente:</p>\n<p>“Há pressão para que as mudanças sejam feitas logo, então não há tempo para debater. E estão propondo fazer mudanças nas leis em um período muito próximo das eleições, o que em muitos países nem é possível ou até mesmo legal.”</p>\n<p><u>A movimenta</u><u>ção para atribuir</u> uma nova autoridade de censura sobre a internet à Polícia Federal seria suficientemente preocupante por si só, dado que o Brasil é o quinto país mais populoso do mundo e o segundo maior do hemisfério. Mas o anúncio vem na sequência <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/03/emmanuel-macron-ban-fake-news-french-president\">de esforços muito semelhantes revelados na semana passada</a> pelo presidente francês Emmanuel Macron, o que sugere uma tendência de que governos explorem a preocupação com “fake news” para justificar o controle estatal sobre a internet.</p>\n<p>No seu discurso de Ano Novo para os jornalistas no palácio Élysée (na foto do topo), o presidente da França declarou que sua nova lei conterá robustos requisitos de transparência para sites na internet – e é possível defendê-los com argumentos válidos. O cerne da lei, no entanto, é a censura: durante o período eleitoral, “uma ação jurídica de emergência poderia permitir às autoridades remover o conteúdo ou mesmo bloquear o site em questão”. Como no Brasil, o novo poder francês abrangeria igualmente as plataformas de mídias sociais e os veículos de mídia tradicionais, permitindo ao governo simplesmente remover sites políticos inteiros da internet por meio de um processo ainda desconhecido.</p>\n<p>Além de ter seu conteúdo político suprimido à força pela atuação estatal, disseminadores de “fake news” poderiam ser condenados a pagar multas em valores equivalentes a milhões de dólares. Como Macron detém a maioria legislativa, “não há dúvida de que ele poderia obter a aprovação”, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/01/macrons-war-on-fake-news/549788/\">noticiou o The Atlantic</a>.</p>\n<p>Tanto o Brasil quanto a França alegaram a mesma justificativa para pleitear poderes de censura sobre a internet: a saber, o perigo representado pela suposta interferência da Rússia nas eleições de 2016 nos EUA. Não importa, porém, o quanto se acredite ter sido relevante o envolvimento da Rússia nas eleições norte-americanas: a não ser por puro alarmismo, é difícil entender como isso poderia justificar a concessão de draconianos poderes de censura a Brasília e Paris.</p>\n<p>Nunca houve sinal de qualquer remoto interesse da Rússia nas eleições brasileiras. Quanto às alegações de Macron e da França durante as eleições, de que ele teria sido vítimas de hackers russos, nenhuma evidência verossímil foi encontrada na investigação conduzida pela <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/fc570e4b400f4c7db3b0d739e9dc5d4d\">própria agência de segurança cibernética da França</a>, a despeito da aceitação sem crítica das acusações pelos veículos de mídia ocidentais. (O mesmo padrão se repetiu na Alemanha, onde aos estridentes alertas sobre a inevitabilidade da interferência russa sobre as eleições se seguiu, findo o período eleitoral, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/world/europe/german-election-russia.html?_r=0\">o reconhecimento</a> de que não havia qualquer indício disso).</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/francehacking-1515583408.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/francehacking-1515583408-1000x780.png\" class=\"wp-image-165374\"></a> </div>\n<p>Todos os esforços para impor censura se baseiam na mesma estratégia: fomentar o medo exagerado de ameaças representadas por vilões, que algumas vezes são domésticos, mas quase sempre são estrangeiros. As táticas brasileira e francesa para induzir o público a concordar com a censura seguem esse roteiro ao pé da letra.</p>\n<p>É o que mostra o discurso do diretor de Investigação e Combate ao Crime Organizado da Polícia Federal:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Certamente, o que aconteceu não só nos Estados Unidos, como também na França, pode acontecer no Brasil. A nossa preocupação é que esse conteúdo falso não interfira no processo eleitoral, nem induza o eleitor. A diferença de lá para aqui é o mecanismo dos órgãos para coibir esse tipo de prática. Queremos construir um modelo de apuração mais efetiva. Tudo que aconteceu lá vai acontecer no Brasil.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Um levantamento do Washington Post mostra o que aconteceu por lá: os tweets apontados como ação russa para influenciar as eleições americanas representam apenas 0.02% do conteúdo sobre este tópico publicados na rede. Ou seja,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/28/theres-still-little-evidence-that-russias-2016-social-media-efforts-did-much-of-anything/?utm_term=.8929ed916d14\"> não tiveram grande influência sobre o eleitorado</a>. Outra pesquisa, alemã, publicada em setembro, também apontou para o fato de que<a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/german-fact-checkers-fake-news-didnt-affect-election-were-not-safe-yet\"> fake news não afetam as urnas</a>.</p>\n<p><u>Embora apresentadas como</u> exigências modernas para combater problemas novos e contemporâneos, as propostas de ambos os países possuem todos os atributos característicos – bem como todas as armadilhas clássicas e todos os riscos graves – das tentativas mais comuns de implementar censura. Para começar, o fato de que esses poderes de censura estarão confinados ao período eleitoral torna a ameaça mais preocupante, não o contrário: o momento em que a população irá escolher seus representantes é exatamente quando a liberdade de expressão é mais vital, e quando os perigos do abuso desses poderes pelos agentes do Estado se mostram mais presentes e mais óbvios.</p>\n<p>O pior é que essas novas propostas de censura se fundamentam em um neologismo recém-cunhado, que desde o início sofreu pela falta de uma definição clara ou consistente. Na esteira da inesperada vitória de Trump em 2016, veículos de mídia norte-americanos produziram um tsunami de matérias alertando sobre os perigos e a grande penetração das “fake news”. Aparentemente da noite para o dia, todos os veículos de mídia e comentaristas começaram a usar o termo de forma casual, como se seu significado fosse claro e indiscutível.</p>\n<p>No entanto, como muitos vêm alertando já há algum tempo, <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2017/03/deciding-who-decides-which-news-is-fake.php\">pouquíssimas pessoas se preocuparam em definir o que esse termo</a> realmente significa. O resultado é que ele se tornou vago, impreciso e carente de um significado consistente. Quaisquer notícias que contenham afirmações falsas relevantes se enquadram? É preciso ter alguma intenção específica, e em caso afirmativo, qual, e como é determinada (simples imprudência se enquadraria)? Os <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/01/01/fake-news-and-how-the-washington-post-rewrote-its-story-on-russian-hacking-of-the-power-grid/#787042a27ad5\">veículos de mídia de grande penetração</a> como o Washington Post, o Le Monde e O Globo poderão ser acusados de publicar “fake news” e estarão sujeitos a essa censura, ou ela estará reservada, como esperado, apenas para os blogs e veículos pequenos e independentes que não possuem uma presença corporativa poderosa?</p>\n<p>Termos mal definidos que se popularizam no discurso político constituem, por definição, propaganda política, e não são indicadores confiáveis e relevantes de problemas. Eles invariavelmente causam estragos previsíveis e ensejam abusos de poder. E, acima de tudo, esses termos – que, por princípio, têm o significado que os grupos poderosos que os usam querem que eles tenham – frequentemente produzem censura arbitrária a pretexto de serem combatidos. Considerem-se dois termos igualmente mal definidos, mas muito populares para fins publicitários, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/19/refusal-call-charleston-shootings-terrorism-shows-meaningless-propaganda-term/\">“terrorismo”</a> e <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/02/free-speech-twitter-france\">“discurso de ódio”</a>, que sofreram apropriação por governos de todo o mundo para justificar os poderes repressivos mais extremos.</p>\n<p>Na última década, diversos países em todos os continentes – inclusive os <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-security-lawmaking/egypts-sisi-approves-anti-terrorism-law-setting-up-special-courts-idUSKCN0QL0TU20150816\">regimes mais repressores do mundo</a> – eliminaram liberdades civis básicas em nome do combate ao “terrorismo”, que para eles significa simplesmente “aqueles que se opõem ao nosso regime”. E “discurso de ódio” algumas vezes é usado para calar nazistas ou racistas ostensivos, mas também pode atingir (e frequentemente o faz) <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/29/in-europe-hate-speech-laws-are-often-used-to-suppress-and-punish-left-wing-viewpoints/\">um amplo espectro de posturas de esquerda</a>, desde a oposição à guerra até a defesa dos direitos dos palestinos. A censura estatal é sempre perigosa, mas o perigo aumenta exponencialmente quando os alvos da censura (terrorismo, discurso de ódio, fake news) não possuem uma definição clara.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/sisi-1515585577.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/sisi-1515585577-540x617.png\" class=\"wp-image-165379\"></a> </div>\n<p>A despeito de sua criação recente, os perigos e o abuso do termo “fake news” já se manifestam por todo o mundo. Como o Comitê de Proteção aos Jornalistas <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2017/03/deciding-who-decides-which-news-is-fake.php\">documentou no ano passado</a>, “a China, consistentemente um dos piores aprisionadores de jornalistas do mundo, vem inovando na aprovação de restrições com formulação vaga que encorajam jornalistas a aderir à narrativa oficial ou se arriscarem a serem caracterizados como <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2015/10/in-china-harsh-penalties-for-false-news-make-it-ha.php\">notícias falsas</a> e acusados de crime”.</p>\n<p>Embora o termo tenha sido usado originalmente nos EUA para se referir aos artigos pró-Trump contendo fatos inverídicos, a falta de definição permitiu ao próprio Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/950103659337134080\">se apropriar rapidamente</a> do termo para desacreditar as notícias (algumas vezes válidas, outras, realmente falsas) que prejudicavam sua imagem. O deputado fascista de direita Jair Bolsonaro, que atualmente está em segundo lugar nas pesquisas para as eleições presidenciais no Brasil, adotou essa estratégia com entusiasmo, e frequentemente diz a seus seguidores para ignorar notícias corretas a seu respeito, alegando se tratar de “fake news”. Essa foi sua resposta previsível e eficaz a uma série de revelações da Folha de São Paulo essa semana, detalhando como ele e seus filhos, também políticos de carreira, acumularam misteriosamente um grande e lucrativo patrimônio imobiliário, embora tenham vivido na última década com modestos vencimentos públicos.</p>\n<p>Se nenhum desses argumentos convencer você a se opor aos esforços para controlar a internet em nome do combate às “fake news”, ou pelo menos a olhar para eles com uma preocupação real, simplesmente aplique as lições de Donald Trump a essa discussão. Por muitos anos, durante a Guerra ao Terror, defensores das liberdades civis tentaram fomentar a oposição ao amplo e incontido poder executivo – prisões sem o devido processo legal, guerras secretas, cidadãos alvo de perseguição letal sem acusação – alertando que, embora seja possível confiar nesses poderes quando se encontram nas mãos de líderes apreciados (como Bush ou Obama), em algum momento um presidente em quem não se confia será eleito, e então será <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/11/glenn-greenwald-trump-will-have-vast-powers-he-can-thank-democrats-for-them/?utm_term=.bbc9152a1042\">tarde demais para evitar que ele faça uso desses poderes</a>.</p>\n<p>Então, para aqueles que estão confortáveis com a ideia de que o atual presidente da França supervisione um programa de censura em conjunto com o judiciário para combater as “fake news” na internet, vocês confiam no governo Trump para tomar essas decisões? Vocês confiam em Marine Le Pen? Vocês confiam no atual presidente do Brasil, que chegou ao poder em circunstâncias altamente suspeitas, já foi flagrado cometendo diversos crimes graves, e cujo índice de aprovação é inferior a 5%? Vocês confiam no candidato fascista que tem chances reais de se tornar presidente do Brasil esse ano? Você confia nos juízes indicados por eles para tomar essas decisões em conjunto?</p>\n<p>No fim das contas, a pergunta central é simples. O que é uma ameaça mais grave: a possibilidade de que as pessoas divulguem afirmações falsas (que existem desde que os seres humanos desenvolveram a habilidade de falar e escrever, e que estão sujeitas a correções), ou dar aos governos de todo o mundo poder para censurar sites inteiros ou publicações em mídias sociais, sob o pretexto de terem sido reputados “falsos” ou “fake”? Desde o advento da internet, o risco considerado mais ameaçador é de que Estados e empresas assumam o controle sobre o conteúdo político que um indivíduo pode expressar.</p>\n<p>Não importa o quanto as justificativas sejam emocionalmente sedutoras ou manipulativas – <em>precisamos acabar com as fake news</em> – obter esse tipo de controle é justamente o que pretendem as propostas apresentadas. Elas já apareceram em dois dos maiores países da Europa e da América do Sul, bem como no país mais populoso do mundo, mas seu crescimento está apenas no estágio inicial.</p>\n<p><em>Tradu</em><em>ção: Deborah Leã</em><em>o</em></p>\n<p>Foto do topo: O presidente francês Emmanuel Macron fala durante coletiva de imprensa, na embaixada de Pequim (China), quarta-feira, 10 de janeiro de 2018.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/governos-do-brasil-e-da-franca-querem-censurar-a-internet-sob-pretexto-de-coibir-noticias-falsas/\">Governos do Brasil e da França querem censurar a internet sob pretexto de coibir notícias falsas</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>A court ruling</u> late Tuesday night stalling President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program appeared to be good news for the young immigrants known as Dreamers, who face deportation if the policy is terminated. But the decision is limited, and congressional negotiations to find a permanent solution for DACA are a mess.</p>\n<p><span>San Francisco-based U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup granted a pretrial injunction that bars the administration from rescinding the program for the time being. Many groups representing DACA recipients have sued since September, when Trump canceled former </span><span>President</span><span> Barack Obama’s 2012 administrative program, which gives recipients renewable two-year protection against deportation, as well as work permit eligibility. </span><span>Alsup ordered the administration to continue receiving requests for DACA renewals, but not to process new applications.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some activists worry that the order, if it remains in place, could subvert the current legislative battle and cause Democrats to become complacent. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said the ruling “in no way diminishes the urgency of resolving the DACA issue,” adding that the only way to guarantee peace of mind and legal status for Dreamers is to pass it into law by attaching it to the budget deal.</span></p>\n<p><span>But Democrats have already backed away once from a promise to force a vote on DACA. In December, </span><span>Democrats vowed not to leave town without a </span><span>DACA fix</span><span>,</span><span> but</span> <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/daca-dreamers-spending-schumer/\"><span>ended up punting</span></a><span> the immigration fight to avoid a government shutdown, breaking for the holidays with the futures of an </span><span>estimated </span><span>800,000 young immigrants in limbo. This time, will Democrats be willing to shut down the government over DACA in an election year?</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Will Democrats be willing to shut down the government over DACA in an election year?</blockquote>\n<p><span>The parties’ approaches appear to be irreconcilable, with Republicans insisting any DACA deal must also include border wall funding — Trump’s asked for $18 billion — which Democrats reject. </span><span>Democrats are hoping to attach Dreamer protections to a spending bill to fund the government (Republicans can’t pass a spending bill themselves; it requires 60 votes and must pass by January 19 in order to avert a shutdown). Republican leadership, meanwhile, maintains that the DACA deal and the spending bill are on separate tracks. </span><span>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday that it is still his view that a DACA-related immigration bill “will not be a part of any overall spending agreement.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said that he and other lawmakers will come up with “a proposed timeline that will allow us to meet that March 5 deadline” — when DACA is due to end under Trump’s plan, unless Congress restores the protections.</span></p>\n<p><span>Framing the fight in terms of meeting a deadline fails to capture the reality of nearly 1 million lives hanging in the balance as lawmakers go back and forth. An estimated</span><span> 120 DACA recipients</span><span> lose their status each day as their permissions expire, and when DACA ends, that number would jump to about 1,165 a day, according to an analysis by the</span> <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2018/01/05/each-day-120-dreamers-lose-protection-deportation/1005081001/\"><span>Arizona Republic</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Congressional negotiations are still all over the map and, at times, incoherent. Even after a lengthy meeting between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday, there’s no apparent consensus on which issues are on the table. Trump said he would sign legislation to extend DACA protections, urging Congress to pass a “bill of love,” but not without border wall funding and increased border security. Following the Tuesday meeting, some lawmakers said they agreed on parameters for the immigration deal, narrowing it down to four areas: border security, DACA protections, an end to “chain migration” — a term used to refer to immigration based on family ties — and the diversity visa lottery program. Still, Democrats argue that they are only agreeing to a clean DREAM Act, and the other topics are lumped into “comprehensive immigration reform.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., told reporters Tuesday that the DACA talks get “bigger and bigger” because Republicans “want to take more portions of immigration and immigration issues and bring them into this situation, when we know that all they have to do is fix a very narrow area.”</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“We’re not going to allow them to use this as a hostage-taking situation to overhaul immigration policy that has been established in the past 40 years”— Rep. Ruben Gallego</blockquote>\n<p><span>“We can negotiate within that area, but we’re not going to allow them to use this as a hostage-taking situation to overhaul immigration policy that has been established in the past 40 years,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span>Dreamers aren’t the only group of immigrants losing protections. The Trump administration on Monday</span> <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/08/el-salvador-immigration-tps-trump/\"><span>announced</span></a><span> it will end the Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, that has allowed over 262,000 Salvadorans to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation for years. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on Monday called the decision “outrageous, cruel,” and “the most vicious thing I’ve ever heard.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he didn’t even know the TPS program existed until recently, adding that Congress shouldn’t just address DACA but “ought to address the whole system.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“I mean, every day I read your reports,” Kennedy told reporters on Tuesday. “There’s a new program that I didn’t know about. I didn’t know about this new program that allows Central Americans to come into the country. Look, if somebody is about to be harmed in their own country and they need safe harbor, we should help them. But they shouldn’t be able to just park and live here forever. The whole diversity visa lottery system makes absolutely no sense to me. And we keep learning about these programs that, at least, I didn’t know about. We clearly need to sit down and address the system and address the problem in a compassionate but firm way.”</span></p>\n<p><span>TPS is also ending for immigrants from Haiti, Sudan, and Nicaragua, and the Trump administration will soon decide the future of TPS for five other countries: Syria, Nepal, Honduras, Yemen, and Somalia. But issues like TPS and the visa lottery system, Gallego said, are part of comprehensive immigration reform and should be dealt with after DACA. What is needed now, he said, is “the DREAM Act. Focused. Narrow.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“Phase one is just fixing the DREAM Act and there may be some negotiations within that, but it’s not going to be some massive tradeoffs,” he said. “They took the hostage, we’re not going to pay for the hostage. We didn’t cause this situation.”</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: People protesting the cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals rally on the steps to the Capitol Building on Capitol Hill on Dec. 6, 2017 in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/daca-program-dreamers-trump-immigration-tps/\">Dreamers Win in Court, But Until Congress Acts, Their Futures Are as Uncertain as Ever</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span><u>On Saturday, a</u> day after becoming aware of a massive store of rebuilding materials being held by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the U.S. federal government — the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, along with their security detail — entered a Palo Seco warehouse owned by the public utility to claim and distribute the equipment, according to a spokesperson for the Corps.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rumors of a tense standoff had been circulating on the island, but the encounter was confirmed to The Intercept in a statement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Asked if the federal officers were armed when they entered the warehouse, USACE spokesperson Luciano Vera said they were indeed accompanied by security detail and quickly began distributing the material after seizing it. Vera declined to say whether there was a confrontation at the entrance, saying only that PREPA officials ultimately toured the warehouse along with the feds:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Leadership responsible for restoring the Puerto Rico power grid and their security detail toured the warehouse in cooperation with PREPA. USACE conducted a full inventory and immediately sent out critical materials to contractors at work sites. USACE will continue to distribute critical materials from the site to contractors. The hope is to strengthen the partnership between PREPA and its restoration partners, while increasing visibility of the inventory of all materials on the island. PREPA has invited FEMA and the Corps to visit its warehouses anytime and to distribute material as needed.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>The federal government “began distributing [supplies] to contractors,” Vera said, including hard-to-find full-tension steel sleeves, critical to rebuilding. “</span><span>We obtained several hundred of these sleeves on Saturday,” Vera added.</span></p>\n<p>The armed encounter comes as around half of Puerto Ricans still remain without electricity well over 100 days after Hurricane Maria. As PREPA hoards crucial resources that could help remedy the island’s dire situation, the Puerto Rican government is attempting to annihilate the power provider’s only regulator.</p>\n<p><span>“Warehouse 5” — the one which USACE and FEMA entered Saturday — “falls under the control of the [PREPA] transmission division and has lacked transparency in inventory and accountability,” the email from Vera continued. Carlos Torres, appointed by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to oversee power restoration, was on site as well. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Due to the size of the warehouse,” Vera said, accounting for everything contained therein is still underway days later. Among the materials recovered so far are “2,875 pieces of critical material to contractors” along with the sleeves of full-tension steel, a component of Puerto Rican electrical infrastructure required to erect new power lines. PREPA did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment, though in a </span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/1ccde02ad9de439eb2bc58f62f7baaff\"><span>statement</span></a><span> to the Associated Press, it rejected allegations that it had failed to distribute the warehouse’s contents. The AP only reported that “officials over the weekend also discovered some needed materials in a previously overlooked warehouse owned by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority.” How they discovered them and how they were obtained is a story that has not been fully told.</span></p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Puerto-rico-powerlines-1515603476.jpg\"><img alt=\"People pass over a downed power line concrete post in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Luquillo, Puerto Rico, Thursday, September 21, 2017.Puerto Rico braced for potentially calamitous flash flooding after being pummeled by Hurricane Maria which devastated the island and knocked out the entire electricity grid.

Under the Stafford Act, utilities can receive reimbursement from FEMA for reconstruction efforts in the wake of a major disaster. Another standard practice is for utilities to enter into mutual aid agreements with public and private utilities. For reasons that remain unclear, PREPA chose not to do so in Maria’s immediate aftermath, instead signing a series of controversial deals with private contractors. The most dubious of those — with the novice Montana-based firm Whitefish Energy — was withdrawn amid public outrage on the mainland and the island alike.</span>\n<p><span>Still, the Whitefish contract was far from the only issue plaguing PREPA’s recovery efforts and keeping Puerto Ricans from getting their lights turned back on. Even now that PREPA is finally pursuing mutual aid agreements with mainland power companies, supply problems — the kind the unified command’s warehouse raid might help alleviate — have kept linemen on the island from being able to do their jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span>A security contractor who recently returned from Puerto Rico told </span><span>The Intercept </span><span>that crews of linemen brought down from the U.S. were frustrated about the lack of rebuilding materials, which made it virtually impossible for them to fix downed infrastructure. Paraphrasing conversations with the electric crews he accompanied, the source said one worker told him that “we just sat in the truck and watched a movie because we have nothing to do today. … Around Christmas, a lot of the power workers were saying, ‘We’re going on vacation because we couldn’t do our job because PREPA was making it so difficult.’” The source’s job involved escorting contractors tasked with reconstructing downed power lines; he was deployed on the island for over a month by a subcontractor of Cobra Acquisitions LLC, which in the fall received a</span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/31/puerto-rico-electric-contract-cobra/\"> <span>$200 million contract</span></a><span> with PREPA to repair its grid.</span></p>\n<p><span>“They didn’t have anything to do or to work on,” he said of many of the linemen he interacted with. “They had had a bunch of poles but no lines, or any of the stuff that goes on the poles. They were just setting bare poles, getting as far as they could go.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“We were in a town for two weeks and barely got anything done because they didn’t have the supplies,” the source noted of one crew they accompanied on the island’s southeast. UTIER — the utility workers’ union — has leveled </span><a href=\"http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/gobierno-politica/nota/el60delosabonadostieneelectricidaddiceaee-1262883/\"><span>similar complaints</span></a><span> against their employer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Frustrated by the slow pace of recovery, a number of mayors around the island have begun taking matters into their own hands, reportedly buying grid restoration supplies out of municipal budgets. Javier Jiménez Pérez, mayor of San Sebastián, compiled a team of electricians, retired PREPA employees, and volunteers to form the </span><a href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/pepinopowerauthorityrestauraelservicioelectricoa2000casas-2385897/\"><span>Pepino Power Authority</span></a><span>, referring to a longer version of the town’s name in Spanish. As of December 28, the makeshift recovery crew had restored power to 2,000 homes, with smaller teams splitting up to return electricity to different neighborhoods. Residents in some areas of San Sebastián told </span><span>El Nuevo Dia </span><span>they never saw PREPA post-Maria.</span></p>\n<p><span>Mismanagement is not a new phenomenon for PREPA, which for decades has been Puerto Rico’s sole power provider. For most of that time, it had been self-regulated, with a board comprised largely of political appointees with little to no background in the electricity sector. The lack of oversight created conditions for corruption and disinvestment, with its generation and transmission capacity falling into severe disrepair over many years.</span></p>\n<p><span>In 2014, Puerto Rico’s legislature undertook a reform effort. That involved moving the board selection process away from its reliance on political appointments, as well as the establishment of the Electric Commission, a three-member body tasked with regulating PREPA and setting rates.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ramón Luis Nieves served in Puerto Rico’s State Senate from 2013 to 2016 and was part of the push to get PREPA’s house in order. During his tenure in the legislature, he chaired the Senate Energy Committee, responsible for creating the Energy Commission in 2014 through Act 57. “For the first time in seven decades of existence,” he told </span><span>The Intercept </span><span>of the board reforms, “PREPA had the benefit of having a governing board composed of non-partisan professionals.”  </span></p>\n<p><span>“When the current administration was in the opposition,” Nieves says of Rosselló’s New Progressive Party, “they opposed all the energy reform bills. Now that they are in power, they have been trying to eliminate the energy regulator and the reforms that were passed.”</span></p>\n<p><span>When Rosselló moved into the governor’s mansion early last year, his administration quickly reverted back to the previous board selection process and replaced much of the utility’s leadership. Among those ousted in the process were the board’s three elected consumer advocates, who — as a former member told me in September — had to be removed via special legislation.</span></p>\n<p><span>Since that time, the governor has been outspoken about his support for privatizing PREPA and other government services, a position he shared with the Washington-appointed Fiscal Oversight Board now overseeing the island’s finances. </span></p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Rosello-puerto-rico-1515603773.jpg\"><img alt=\"Puerto Rico Gov.

Already, though, his office has unveiled a number of sweeping, board-friendly policies under the auspices of the New Government Law, approved by the legislature just before Christmas. On Monday, Puerto Rico’s Secretary of Public Affairs and Public Policy Ramón Rosario Cortés</span> <a href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/elgobiernoanunciacincoconsolidacionesdeagencias-2388446/\"><span>announced</span></a><span> five proposals to dramatically reorganize the island’s government in pursuance with the new law — including what would amount to a liquidation of the Energy Commission. </span>\n<p><span>The plan would consolidate five separate regulatory agencies into a single, three-member commission, eliminating the Telecommunications Regulatory Board, Public Service Commission, Energy Commission, Energy Administration, and the Independent Office for Consumer Protection as independent entities. In their place would stand the Public Service Regulatory Board, which officials argue would operate along the lines of state-level Public Utility Commissions in the U.S. It’s unclear which functions of the previous agencies would continue in the new body.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rosselló’s proposal is billed as a cost-saving measure, although neither the Telecommunications Regulatory Board nor the Energy Commission, at least, receive funding from the state or federal governments. The former is funded via a fee on telecommunications’ customers monthly bills, and the latter by PREPA via its ratepayers, who furnish the independent commission with its annual $5 million budget.</span></p>\n<p><span>While Nieves — like many — favors some level of private investment in PREPA, which is $9 billion in debt, he’s weary of attracting corporations to the utility without a competent regulator. “If you do away with an independent and strong regulator, you’ll have Whitefish all over again,” he said. “If they remove the Energy Commission, they should rename PREPA the Whitefish Energy Company of Puerto Rico.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Since its establishment, the Energy Commission has taken a number of steps to help bring the island’s electricity sector into the 21st century, including an Integrated Resource Plan that laid out a path for transitioning the island off expensive imported oil and toward renewables. It helped defend ratepayers against the island’s bondholders, too; when the National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation </span><a href=\"https://npfg.com/pdf/PressRelease/Petition_Rate_Review_Temp_Rate_WEIL_95433694_20.pdf\"><span>pushed</span></a><span> for a 4.2 cent per kilowatt hour rate hike in September, the commission</span> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-prepa/puerto-ricos-prepa-extends-creditor-agreement-negotiates-with-insurers-idUSKCN0RV59U20151001\"><span>denied</span></a><span> the request.</span></p>\n<p><span>The commission also just recently unveiled the country’s first-ever regulatory rulebook for microgrids, a form of decentralized power generation that allows small geographic areas — neighborhoods or hospitals, for instance — to generate power locally and bring electricity back online quickly after major natural disasters and outages. Included in the suite of regulations was a mandate that any microgrids developed on the island use renewable fuel sources, although the rule would not apply to microgrids developed by PREPA itself.</span></p>\n<p><span>Those regulations were opened for public comment this week, yet the future of that and other Energy Commission-created rules will be up in the air if the governor’s proposal is eventually approved by the legislature and fiscal control board. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another likely casualty of the reorganization proposal would be the Independent Office for Consumer Protection, which helps customers bring complaints against PREPA and seek remuneration for any utility wrongdoing. The agency’s 2014 establishment was heavily pushed for by the AARP, which received complaints from elderly Puerto Ricans about their electricity service. A</span><a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/money/budgeting-saving/info-2014/2014-aarp-survey-of-puerto-rico-residents-age-25-and-older-on-el.html\"> <span>survey</span></a><span> conducted that same year by the group found that 82 percent of Puerto Ricans ages 25 and older “do not believe their interests are fairly represented and taken into consideration when electric rates are set by PREPA”; 86 percent supported the establishment of a consumer advocate office. </span><br>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Puerto-Rico-electricity-1515602592.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Puerto Rico Electric and Power Authority lineman attaches an electrical insulator to a new utility pole in a residential area in Gurabo, Puerto Rico on November 29, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Ricardo ARDUENGO / TO GO WITH AFP STORY By Leila MACOR, US-PuertoRico-power-weather-reconstruction-hurricane        (Photo credit should read RICARDO ARDUENGO/AFP/Getty Images)\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Puerto-Rico-electricity-1515602592-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165415\"></a>\n<p>A Puerto Rico Electric and Power Authority lineman attaches an electrical insulator to a new utility pole in a residential area in Gurabo, Puerto Rico, on Nov. 29, 2017.</p>\n<p>Photo: Ricardo Arduengo/ AFP/Getty Images</p></div><br>\n<span><u>The push to</u> upend popular regulation over PREPA, of course, comes after several decades of austerity, jumpstarted after the PROMESA bill — passed by Congress in 2016 — that tasks the Fiscal Oversight Board with getting the island’s fiscal house in order and handling its at least $74 billion in municipal debt. Other recently announced cost-cutting measures include the governor’s Voluntary Transition program aimed at incentivizing public employees to quit their jobs and seek work with non-profits or the private sector, and the privatization of the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics. </span>\n<p><span>As American Statistical Association President Lisa LaVange pointed out in a recent letter, such a move would be darkly ironic considering the government’s gross miscounting of the number of deaths that have occurred since Maria. LaVange chided the governor for not allowing experts to help revise the death count and his proposal to disband PRIS. “Government statistics play a powerful role in any democracy. They empower the economy, serve the health and welfare of its citizens, improve governance, and inform decisions and policies in the public and private sector, among many other vital functions,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span>And though media attention has largely cycled away from Puerto Rico, conservative think tanks are continuing to outline plans for still more massive blows to the island’s public sphere. In a December</span><a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publication/puerto-ricos-economic-challenges/\"> <span>statement</span></a><span> before the Fiscal Oversight Board, American Enterprise Institute Resident Fellow Desmond Lachman argued that “what is desperately needed” in Puerto Rico “is a comprehensive IMF-style structural adjustment program,” including a deep cut to the island’s minimum wage. Oversight Board member Andrew Biggs has been a resident scholar at AEI since 2008. </span></p>\n<p><span>The path to any economic recovery from Puerto Rico will ultimately run through its ability to rebuild a functional energy grid — a future all too unlikely amid austerity and deregulation. Combined with other kinds of storm damage, the loss of power has fueled a rapid uptick in emigration from the island, as people struggle to attain jobs and basic services; an estimated 300,000 people have moved to Florida alone, a scale of emigration that could further downsize the island’s already shrinking tax base. Nieves calls those who’ve left “energy refugees,” for whom “the lack of energy was the last straw.” </span></p>\n<p><span>“Most of them,” he predicts, “will not return.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>Update: Jan. 10, 2018, 7 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p>Sen. Eduardo Bhatia, minority leader of the Senate of Puerto Rico, provided a statement to The Intercept on the hoarded electrical equipment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The news that has come out today about the discovery made by armed federal agents of thousands of electrical spare parts hidden in an PREPA warehouse borders on a criminal act by its managers. It is time for people to stand up and demand answers. Hundreds of thousands of families have been in the dark for more than 125 days, people keep dying, and businesses continue to close due to the lack of energy while the necessary spare parts were in the possession of PREPA. Lying about not having the parts to cover the inefficiency of PREPA is outrageous and those responsible must be taken before state and federal authorities to be criminally processed immediately.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Top photo: Employees of Crowley and FEMA revise electrical posts from Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority at dock 16 in San Juan , Puerto Rico on Nov. 30, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/puerto-rico-electricity-prepa-hurricane-maria/\">Armed Federal Agents Enter Warehouse in Puerto Rico to Seize Hoarded Electric Equipment</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span><u>At 5 o’clock</u> on the morning of November 13, more than 200 Haitian police officers raided the Grand Ravine area of Port-au-Prince. There was a series of loud explosions, followed by gunfire. For the next six hours, the commotion didn’t stop. The neighborhood was under siege.</span></p>\n<p><span>What had started as an anti-gang operation in a poor and largely forgotten neighborhood — in a poor and largely forgotten country — ended in the summary execution of innocent civilians on a school campus. </span></p>\n<p><span>The police officers were working with the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. It was launched in October, a reboot of a previous mission that had begun in 2004, when thousands of U.N. troops were sent to Haiti following a coup d’etat, tasked in part with restoring stability and reinforcing national police capacities. </span></p>\n<p><span>And though the U.N. mission issued a </span><a href=\"https://minujusth.unmissions.org/la-minujusth-condamne-les-violences-commis-%C3%A0-grand-ravine-et-appelle-les-autorit%C3%A9s-nationales-%C3%A0\"><span>statement</span></a><span> days after the raid calling for a prompt investigation by Haitian authorities, it did not publicly acknowledge its own role in the operation. But in late December, a U.N. spokesperson confirmed to The Intercept for the first time that the mission had helped plan the raid, though it distanced itself from the civilian deaths.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The reported civilian death[s] were not part of the planned operation but of a unilateral action conducted by some [Haitian police] officers after the conclusion of the operation,” the spokesperson, Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, wrote in an email. The raid of the school, according to the U.N. statement, was done without authorization, without alerting the police hierarchy, and outside of the operational plan.</span></p>\n<p>Boutaud de la Combe said that, a day after the raid, the U.N. “conducted an internal enquiry with all the unit commanders who participated in the operation.” The U.N. inquiry, not previously reported, absolved the U.N.  finding that U.N. police did not fire their weapons and only “secured the perimeter” of the school, she said.</p>\n<p>“None of the [U.N. police] unit proceeded to the location at Maranatha College where the alleged killings took place,” the spokesperson wrote. “The planned portion of the operation went relatively well. The post-operation unilateral initiative of some HNP members to conduct a high risk search, proceeding outside of the operational cadre, without advising the hierarchy, without authorization and contravening the operation plan was not part of the planned operation.”<span><br>\n</span><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-school-raid-campus-1515426827.jpg\"><img alt=\"Main school logo inside the front gate and near entrance to courtyard on Maranatha campus in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-school-raid-campus-1515426827-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165022\"></a>\n<p>Main school logo inside the front gate and near entrance to courtyard on Maranatha campus in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.</p>\n<p>Photo: Jake Johnston</p></div>\n<p><span><u>When I arrived</u> at the Maranatha Evangelical College campus, traveling with a broadcast team from Al Jazeera four days after the raid, it was immediately obvious something heinous had transpired.</span></p>\n<p><span>The blood that stained the concrete was still wet, unable to dry in the blanket of fog and mist that kept the capital unusually cool that particular week. Water pooled in the courtyard’s clogged drain had turned a dark red, partially obscuring an empty tear gas canister. The smell of the violence still hung in the heavy air.</span></p>\n<p><span>Classrooms and offices had been ransacked, the contents of closets, drawers, and bookcases spilled across the floors and through the doorways. Light crept in through holes left by bullets that had pierced through the thick concrete. Sometime since the raid, someone had swept another five empty tear gas canisters and close to 100 heavy artillery shells into a pile.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The morning we arrived, faculty and students were meeting to mourn those who had been killed. The school was still closed. They gathered in one of the small classrooms, closed the door to us outsiders, and began to sing. The religious hymns — deep, soulful melodies — echoed throughout the courtyard where they mixed with cries of grieving victims and family members anxious to tell their stories.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I must kill myself,” Monique Larosse, whose nephew was shot in this courtyard days earlier, told us. “Why did they kill him when they know he was not one of the bad men? He was someone who went to church, studied, and had principles.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The stories Larose, along with other survivors and family members, told me make clear something went horribly wrong on that mid-November day. While there’s a lot still unclear, one thing is for certain — the official narrative is at odds with what the people of Grand Ravine say they witnessed and experienced. And they are a far ways off from finding justice. </span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-tear-gas-1515426832.jpg\"><img alt=\"Tear gas canisters and ammunition swept into a pile at Maranatha campus in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-tear-gas-1515426832-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165024\"></a>\n<p>Tear gas canisters and ammunition swept into a pile at Maranatha campus in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.</p>\n<p>Photo: Jake Johnston</p></div>\n<p><span><u>Located near the</u> southern entrance to Haiti’s sprawling capital, Grand Ravine is built on a hillside with picturesque views of the Caribbean Sea. And yet, it’s a downtrodden neighborhood. </span></p>\n<p><span>Haphazard construction with paltry regulation has left neighborhoods, including Grand Ravine, with little to no infrastructure or government services. Many areas are only accessible by foot. </span></p>\n<p><span>Narrow, misshapen alleys ascend through the concrete homes secured with rusted sheet metal.</span></p>\n<p><span>Amid all this is the Maranatha Evangelical College, which has operated here since the 1940s. Despite the name, it offers classes for neighborhood kids beginning in preschool. The campus is a mashup of school buildings, houses and a healthy number of full-size trees, a dissonant image in a city overwhelmed by concrete. A low wall marks it off from the surrounding area. </span></p>\n<p><span>The only entrance to the elevated campus is a sloping, winding road that sits behind a large metal gate. The campus is a refuge, an oasis of calm in a section of Haiti rife with gang activity.</span></p>\n<p>Grand Ravine is a “red zone,” the label international forces give to the country’s most violence-prone areas. In December 2016, Grand Ravine’s most powerful gang leader, Junior Decimus, was arrested at the airport when he attempted to travel abroad. Soon after, according to a report by local rights organization Justice and Peace, an armed conflict began as others sought to consolidate control of the neighborhood. “Bursts of automatic weapons sang during the day, while police officers from the nearby station watched helplessly,” according to a hard copy of the organization’s report.</p>\n<p><span>In October, the month before the police raid, <a href=\"http://rnddh.org/content/uploads/2017/11/9-Grand-Rivine-29Nov2017.pdf\">groups of armed youth set up roadblocks,</a> robbing cars in plain sight as they passed.</span></p>\n<p><span>The same month, thousands of U.N. soldiers stationed in the country since the 2004 coup d’etat withdrew. Brought to Haiti to restore “stability,” the foreign troops have been involved in multiple deadly raids into neighborhoods similar to Grand Ravine. The international community has spent hundreds of millions training the Haitian police for the U.N.’s eventual departure.</span></p>\n<p><span>The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti ended its mandate in October, but the U.N. is by no means gone. In place of troops, the U.N. created a smaller successor mission composed of a few thousand police officers. In early November, together with the local police force responsible for the capital, that new U.N. mission helped plan the anti-gang raid into Grand Ravine.</span></p>\n<p><span>The November 13 raid was one of the first major acts involving the new mission, and the response will define the future of the U.N.’s relationship with the people of Grand Ravine — and the success of the newly empowered local police force. </span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/haiti-Port-au-Prince-1515191622.jpg\"><img alt=\"View of houses on a mountain in Juvenat, in the commune of Petion-Ville, in Port-au-Prince, on December 12, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / HECTOR RETAMAL        (Photo credit should read HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images)\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/haiti-Port-au-Prince-1515191622-1024x682.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164943\"></a>\n<p>View of houses on a mountain in Juvenat, in the commune of Petion-Ville, in Port-au-Prince, on Dec. 12, 2017.</p>\n<p>Photo: Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><span><u>At 6:30 on</u> that mid-November morning, Armand Louis received a phone call from Maranatha College, the school he has directed for the last 30 years.

According to the U.N., they administered first aid to the injured police officers and secured the perimeter.</span></p>\n<p><span>But on campus grounds, Haitian police proceeded to punish the bystanders caught up in the violence.</span></p>\n<p><span>First, they shot and killed Fongene, the guard, witnesses said.</span></p>\n<p><span>Police then accused Louis of setting them up. They dragged him into the central courtyard, where some faculty members and people who live on campus were present. The officers beat him with a chair, causing significant injuries to his head and torso. The Protestant Evangelical Baptist Mission of Haiti, affiliated with the school, included an account of the beating in its statement describing the events, and it was confirmed in an interview with Louis and in the RNDDH report.</span></p>\n<p><span>Faculty tried to intervene. </span><span>David Jean Baptiste, a professor, was beaten and then shot five times, including a bullet to the head. The courtyard grounds where he died remained bloodstained for days after. </span></p>\n<p><span>Vanel Danger lives on the school’s campus and is responsible for the cafeteria. He told The Intercept that an officer put a gun to his head and threatened to pull out his teeth if he didn’t cooperate. Danger dropped to his knees and begged for his life. Danger told the officer he had given him water just an hour earlier, RNDDH reported. Danger was spared. But many more weren’t so lucky.</span></p>\n<p><span>Louis, bloody and beaten, told The Intercept he was handcuffed by an officer in a U.N. uniform and hauled off to jail.</span></p>\n<p><span>When the police finally left the campus, around 11 a.m., nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard — five of whom had been shot in the head. Not a single firearm was recovered, suggesting that the killings were “summary executions,” RNDDH reported.</span></p>\n<p><span>The bodies were not removed until the next afternoon.</span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-school-raid-1515426830.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ransacked school room at Maranatha campus in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-school-raid-1515426830-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165023\"></a>\n<p>Ransacked school room at Maranatha campus in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.</p>\n<p>Photo: Jake Johnston</p></div>\n<p><span><u>Four days after</u> the raid, the alleys that weave around the campus and through the neighborhood’s hilly landscape were largely deserted. Groups of young kids watched us from rooftops. Darting eyes peering from behind small openings in concrete homes followed us throughout the neighborhood.</span></p>\n<p>Very few of them wanted to speak.</p>\n<p><span>“There are many more” victims of this and other shootings, a local resident and student at the school explained. “They are afraid,” added the student, whose name The Intercept is withholding out of concern for their safety.</span></p>\n<p><span>Though the anti-gang raid ended with a schoolyard massacre, questions linger about what happened outside the campus, where the raid began. At first, the police acknowledged seven civilian deaths — all of which occurred at the school. Overall, the police made 32 arrests, but haven’t acknowledged any deaths outside of the school.</span></p>\n<p><span>But in its investigation, RNDDH concluded that one of the people found dead on campus had been pulled out of his house in the surrounding neighborhood that morning and brought to the school only after his death.</span></p>\n<p><span>The total death toll remains unknown.</span></p>\n<p><span>Doresne Jean, director of the Saint Claire morgue in downtown Port-au-Prince, said that eight bodies had arrived from Grand Ravine on Tuesday, the day after the raid — more than the police originally acknowledged. But Jean said there were surely more.</span></p>\n<p>“Maybe the police moved some bodies,” Jean said, “because we had five or six people come here to ask if we had their relatives.” They were not on the list of bodies already received.</p>\n<p><span>Justice and Peace, the local human rights organization that has been monitoring violence in neighborhoods such as Grand Ravine, was one of the first to investigate the massacre. Rovelsond Apollon, an observer there, said his organization had confirmed 12 dead, but that the real total would likely never be known.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not that many people, even in Haiti, are paying attention to what happens in Grand Ravine. “A hundred or even 200 could die there and nobody would know,” Apollon said.</span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-school-raid-courtyard-1515427396.jpg\"><img alt=\"Four days after the raid a single shoe sits in the middle of the Soccer field behind Maranatha College in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-school-raid-courtyard-1515427396-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165029\"></a>\n<p>Four days after the raid, a single shoe sits in the middle of the soccer field behind Maranatha College in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span><u>“I don’t know</u> how I am going to live without my son,” Gina Napolean</span> <span>told us from the school’s courtyard, the grief visible on her face just four days after the massacre</span>. <span>Her only son, 22-year-old Kens Napoleon, had been the family’s breadwinner. He was killed by a shot to the head. She put the blame squarely on the government, who she accused of “sending the police to kill our children.”</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s not just that politicians exert control over the police, Apollon said — they are involved with the gangs themselves. His organization has interviewed young people with heavy weaponry that is not easy to acquire, he explained, and they said the weapons had been provided by politicians. “Politicians and authorities are not innocent in what happened, because they, too, play their part in the violence,” he said. The politicians, for their part, have not publicly addressed these accusations.    </span></p>\n<p><span>But since the raid, nearly every government official or institution has avoided taking responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span>Asked about the raid, the police chief simply <a href=\"http://lenouvelliste.com/article/179239/bavure-policiere-a-grand-ravine-la-division-au-sein-de-la-pnh-a-encore-frappe\">said it was planned by the local captain</a> and the new U.N. mission. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant told the press that the specifics of field operations were outside his purview. Both blamed poor planning for the bloodshed.</span></p>\n<p><span>The operation was compromised from the beginning. Police officers told local human rights investigators that confidential information about the operation was circulating even before it took place.</span></p>\n<p><span>A former Haitian military official later told me that he found out about the raid when he heard it being discussed on an open radio channel on November 12, the day before it was launched. A gang leader later called in to a local radio show, alleging that a rival gang from a different neighborhood had participated with police in the raid itself. Others have suggested the raid was an attempt to recover a cache of guns that authorities had distributed in the neighborhood weeks earlier. And so the rumor mill in Haiti churns. </span></p>\n<p><span>The U.N.’s statement — that its officers were stationed only at the perimeter of the school — contradicts the statements made by Louis, who told me he was handcuffed by a U.N. agent on campus. The U.N. insists that it was uninvolved because its officers were not in the courtyard, but the entrance where they say they were stationed is set just below the scene of the massacre.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The new U.N. mission is ostensibly focused on justice, but Apollon noted that Haiti has seen many international missions throughout its history. “They all failed,” he said, because they do not understand the Haitian reality.  </span></p>\n<p><span>In Haiti, he said, impunity reigns.</span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Haiti-Port-au-Prince-prison-1515427979.jpg\"><img alt=\"PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI - JANUARY 27:  Boys play in the ruins of a building on the site of the Fort Dimanche prison, where many were held in inhumane conditions under the regime of Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier January 27, 2011 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

The police inspector general has completed an investigation and passed it on to a judge, who could order the arrest or dismissal of officers involved. One police officer accused of involvement is already missing, according to the inspector general. Families of nine victims, including those of the two police officers, received a one-time payment of about $1,500 for funeral expenses. But none of the intellectual authors of the botched raid appear to have been identified or questioned.</span></p>\n<p>Instead, it was Louis, the school’s director, who was arrested for complicity in the death of the two police officers. After being publicly beaten with a chair at the school he had overseen for 30 years, Louis was held in a Port-au-Prince jail for more than a week.</p>\n<p><span>Under pressure from religious organizations and the school’s faculty, Louis was eventually released for health reasons. But he still has not returned to the school.</span></p>\n<p><span>“In a country like mine,” Louis wrote to me weeks later, “it is hard to take our leaders at their word.” That, he continued, was “why we need to know what the real motive [of the raid] was.” The public authorities have not yet interviewed him. Do “they really want everything to be investigated properly?” he said, “or was this all planned?”</span></p>\n<p><span>Apollon said continued raids would do little to address the fundamental problems afflicting neighborhoods such as Grand Ravine. Rather, violence stems from the total absence of the state in such areas, and it will continue so long as the population’s needs are not met. What residents need, he said, “is education.”</span></p>\n<p><span>After the raid, the school was closed for two weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We need school,” a student at Maranatha told me that day in the courtyard. “Without education, what hope do we have?”</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: Police watch as demonstrators march to protest against the government of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in Port-au-Prince on Oct. 24, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/haiti-raid-united-nations-police-grand-ravine/\">A U.N.-Backed Police Force Carried Out a Massacre in Haiti.

        "content": "<p><u>Yesterday afternoon, the</u> official Twitter account of Brazil’s Federal Police (its FBI equivalent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FENAPEF/status/950741290790150145\">posted an extraordinary announcement</a>. The bureaucratically nonchalant tone it used belied its significance. The tweet, at its core, purports to vest in the federal police and the federal government that oversees it the power to regulate, control, and outright censor political content on the internet that is assessed to be “false,” and to “punish” those who disseminate it. The new power would cover both social media posts and entire websites devoted to politics.</p>\n<p>“In the next few days, the Federal Police will begin activities in Brasília [the nation’s capital] by a specially formed group to combat false news during the [upcoming 2018 presidential] election process,” the official police tweet stated. It added: “The measures are intended to identify and punish the authors of ‘fake news’ for or against candidates.” Top police officials told media outlets that their working group would include representatives of the judiciary’s election branch and leading prosecutors, though <a href=\"http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,gilmar-monta-forca-tarefa-anti-fake-news,70002113877\">one of the key judicial figures</a> involved is the highly controversial right-wing Supreme Court judge, Gilmar Mendes, who has long blurred judicial authority with his political activism.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/pftr-1515584255.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/pftr-1515584255-540x555.png\" class=\"wp-image-165377\"></a> </div>\n<p>Among the most confounding aspects of the Twitter announcement is that it is very difficult to identify any existing law that actually authorizes the federal police to exercise the powers they just announced they intend to wield, particularly over the internet. At least as of now, they are claiming for themselves one of the most extremist powers imaginable — the right of the government to control and suppress political content on the internet during an election — with no legal framework to define its parameters or furnish safeguards against abuse.</p>\n<p>Proponents of this new internet censorship program have suggested they will seek congressional enactment of a new law to authorize the censorship program and define how it functions. But it is far from clear that Brazil’s dysfunctional Congress — in which a majority of members face corruption charges — will be able to enact a new statutory scheme before the election.</p>\n<p>Tellingly, these police officials vow that they will proceed to implement the censorship program <em>even if</em> no new law is enacted. They insist that no new laws are necessary by <a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/pf-cogita-uso-de-lei-da-ditadura-para-coibir-fake-news-nas-eleicoes-22257120\">pointing to a pre-internet censorship law</a> enacted in 1983 — during the time Brazil was ruled by a brutal military dictatorship that severely limited free expression and routinely imprisoned dissidents.</p>\n<p>A top police official just yesterday <a href=\"https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/coluna-do-fraga/eleicoes-diretor-da-pf-defende-mudar-lei-para-combater-fake-news-08012018\">warned that</a>, absent a new law, they will invoke the authorities of one of the dictatorship era’s most repressive laws: the so-called Law of National Security, which contain deliberately vague passages making it a felony to “spread rumors that caused panic.” Yet he complained that the old dictatorship-era law is inadequate in part because it is too lenient, providing “only” for “months” in prison for those who disseminate “fake news,” which he called a “very low punishment.”</p>\n<p>That 1983 legal framework was used by Brazil’s military dictatorship to arrest dissidents, critics, and democracy activists. That they are now eyeing a resurrection of this dictatorship-era censorship law to regulate and censor contemporary political expression on the internet — all in the name of stopping “fake news” — powerfully symbolizes how inherently tyrannical and dangerous are all government attempts to control political expression.</p>\n<p><u>The move to</u> obtain new censorship authority over the internet by Brazilian police officials would be disturbing enough standing alone given Brazil’s status as the world’s fifth most populous country and second-largest in the hemisphere. But that Brazil’s announcement closely follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/03/emmanuel-macron-ban-fake-news-french-president\">very similar efforts unveiled last week</a> by French President Emmanuel Macron strongly suggests a trend in which governments are now exploiting concerns over “fake news” to justify state control over the internet.</p>\n<p>In his New Year’s speech to journalists at the Élysée palace, the French president vowed that his new law would contain some robust transparency obligations for websites — ones for which valid arguments may be assembled. But the crux of the law is censorship: During elections, “an emergency legal action could allow authorities to remove that content or even block the website.” As in Brazil, the new French power would cover social media platforms and traditional media outlets alike, allowing the government through an as-yet-unknown process to simply remove entire political websites from the internet.</p>\n<p>Beyond having one’s political content forcibly suppressed by the state, disseminators of “fake news” could face fines of many millions of dollars. Given Macron’s legislature majority, “there is little doubt about its ability to pass,” <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/01/macrons-war-on-fake-news/549788/\">the Atlantic reports</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Brazil and France cited the same purported justification for obtaining censorship powers over the internet: namely, the dangers posed by alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. But no matter how significant one views Russian involvement in the U.S. election, it is extremely difficult to see how — beyond rank fear-mongering — that could justify these types of draconian censorship powers by Brasília and Paris.</p>\n<p>There has never been any indication of any remote Russian interest in Brazilian’s domestic elections. The claims from Macron and France during the election that were uncritically believed by Western media outlets — that he was the victim of Russian hacking — turned out to lack any credible evidence, as France’s <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/fc570e4b400f4c7db3b0d739e9dc5d4d\">own cyber security agency concluded</a> after an investigation. (That same pattern repeated itself in Germany, where vocal warnings about the inevitability of Russian interference in German elections were followed by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/world/europe/german-election-russia.html?_r=0\">post-election admissions</a> that there was no evidence of any such thing.)</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/francehacking-1515583408.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/francehacking-1515583408-1000x780.png\" class=\"wp-image-165374\"></a> </div>\n<p>All censorship efforts rest on the same tactic: generating fear over exaggerated threats posed by villains, sometime domestic ones but more often foreign villains. The Brazilian and French tactic for inducing the public to acquiesce to this censorship faithfully follows that script.</p>\n<p><u>Though presented as</u> modern necessities to combat new, contemporaneous problems, both countries’ proposals have all the defining attributes — and all the classic pitfalls and severe dangers — of standard state censorship efforts. To begin with, the fact that these censorship powers are confined to election time makes it more menacing, not less: Having a population choose its leaders is exactly when free expression is most vital, and when the dangers of abuse of censorship powers wielded by state officials are most acute and obvious.</p>\n<p>Worse, these new censorship proposals are centrally based on a newly concocted term that, from the start, never had any clear or consistent definition. In the wake of Donald Trump’s unexpected 2016 victory, U.S. media outlets produced a tidal wave of reports warning of the damage and pervasiveness of “fake news.” Seemingly overnight, every media outlet and commentator was casually using the term as though its meaning were clear and indisputable.</p>\n<p>Yet, as many have long been warning, <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2017/03/deciding-who-decides-which-news-is-fake.php\">few people, if any, ever bothered to define what the term</a> actually means. As a result, it’s incredibly vague, shifting, and devoid of consistent meaning. Do any news articles that contain false, significant assertions qualify? Is there some intent requirement, and if so, what is it and how is determined (does recklessness qualify)? Can <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/01/01/fake-news-and-how-the-washington-post-rewrote-its-story-on-russian-hacking-of-the-power-grid/#787042a27ad5\">large mainstream outlets</a> such as the Washington Post, Le Monde, and Globo be guilty of publishing “fake news” and thus subject to this censorship, or is it — as one expects — reserved only for small, independent blogs and outlets that lack a powerful corporate presence?</p>\n<p>Ill-defined terms that become popularized in political discourse are, by definition, terms of propaganda rather than reliable, meaningful indicators of problems. And invariably, they wreak all kinds of predictable havoc and inevitably give rise to abuses of power. More than anything else, such terms — which, by design, mean whatever the powerful groups wielding them want them to mean — so often produce arbitrary censorship in the name of combatting them. Just consider two similarly ill-defined but popular propagandistic terms — “<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/19/refusal-call-charleston-shootings-terrorism-shows-meaningless-propaganda-term/\">terrorism</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/02/free-speech-twitter-france\">hate speech</a>” — which have been appropriated by governments all over the world to justify the most extreme, repressive powers.</p>\n<p>The last decade has seen multiple countries on every continent — including the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-security-lawmaking/egypts-sisi-approves-anti-terrorism-law-setting-up-special-courts-idUSKCN0QL0TU20150816\">world’s most repressive regimes</a> — obliterate basic civil liberties in the name of stopping “terrorism,” by which they mean little other than “those who oppose our regime.” And then there’s “hate speech,” which can sometimes be used to silence Nazis or overt racists, but also can be and often is used to silence <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/29/in-europe-hate-speech-laws-are-often-used-to-suppress-and-punish-left-wing-viewpoints/\">a wide range of left-wing views</a>, from war opposition to advocacy of Palestinian rights. State censorship is always dangerous, but the danger is exponentially magnified when the censorship targets (terrorism, hate speech, fake news) lack clear definition.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/sisi-1515585577.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/sisi-1515585577-540x617.png\" class=\"wp-image-165379\"></a> </div>\n<p>Despite its recent invention, the dangers and abuse of the term “fake news” are already manifest all over the world. As the Committee to Protect Journalists <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2017/03/deciding-who-decides-which-news-is-fake.php\">documented last year</a>, “China, consistently one of the worst jailers of journalists worldwide, has led the way in enacting vaguely worded restrictions encouraging journalists to adhere to the official narrative or risk being branded <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2015/10/in-china-harsh-penalties-for-false-news-make-it-ha.php\">false news</a> and charged with a crime.”</p>\n<p>While the term was originally used in the U.S. to refer to factually false articles that supported Trump, its lack of definition enabled Trump himself to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/950103659337134080\">quickly appropriate</a> the term to discredit journalism (some valid, some actually false) that reflected poorly on him. The right-wing, fascist Brazilian member of Congress who is currently in a strong second place in all polls for next year’s Brazilian presidential race, Jair Bolsonaro, has now enthusiastically adopted this tactic, routinely telling his followers to ignore clearly accurate reporting about him on the ground that it’s “fake news.” That was his predictable, and effective, response to a series of exposés this week from Folha, Brazil’s largest newspaper, detailing how he and his politician sons have mysteriously compiled a large, lucrative real estate portfolio despite living for the last decade on a very modest public salary.</p>\n<p>If none of those points convinces you to oppose, or at least be seriously concerned about, efforts to control the internet in the name of “fake news,” simply apply the lessons of Donald Trump to this debate. For years during the war on terror, civil libertarians tried to generate opposition to vast, unchecked executive power — due process-free detentions, secret wars, targeting one’s own citizens for assassination with no charges — by warning that although one may trust these powers in the hands of leaders that one likes (George W. Bush or Barack Obama), at some point a president you distrust will enter the Oval Office, and by then, it will be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/11/glenn-greenwald-trump-will-have-vast-powers-he-can-thank-democrats-for-them/?utm_term=.bbc9152a1042\">too late to prevent him from exercising those powers</a>.</p>\n<p>So for those who are comfortable with the current French leader overseeing a censorship program in conjunction with courts to censor “fake news” from the internet, do you trust the Trump administration to make those determinations? Do you trust Marine Le Pen? Do you the trust the current Brazilian president who seized power under highly suspicious circumstances, who has been caught repeatedly committing serious crimes and whose approval ratings is less than 5 percent? Do you trust the truly fascist Brazilian candidate who has a real chance to become president this year of the world’s fifth-largest country? Do you trust the judges they appoint to make these determinations in conjunction with them?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the core question here is a simple one. Which is the more serious threat: the ability of people to publish false claims (which have existed since humans developed the capacity to speak or write, and are subject to correction), or vesting governments around the world to censor entire websites and social media postings on the ground that they have judged them to be “false” or “fake?”  Since the advent of the internet, the one danger regarded as most menacing was having states and corporations assume control over the political content that one can express.</p>\n<p>No matter how emotionally appealing or manipulative these justifications are — <em>we must stop fake news</em> — conferring that type of control is exactly what these new proposals are intended to do. They have already emerged in two of the largest and most influential countries in Europe and South America, as well as the world’s most populous country; their growth is only in its incipient stage.</p>\n<p>Top photo: French President Emmanuel Macron speaks at a press conference at the French Embassy in Beijing, Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/first-france-now-brazil-unveils-plans-to-empower-the-government-to-censure-the-internet-in-the-name-of-stopping-fake-news/\">First France, Now Brazil Unveils Plan to Empower the Government to Censor the Internet in the Name of Stopping “Fake News”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Representatives from</u> Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, traveled to Cambridge, Iowa, in October to <a href=\"http://jasperema-hls.org/news/dakota-access-pipeline-donates-20000-to-jasper-county-emergency-management-agency/\">present</a> a series of $20,000 checks to emergency management departments in six counties. The money was, in part, an acknowledgement of the months of anti-pipeline protests that had taxed local agencies during construction, but it was also a nod to the possibility of environmental contamination. One of the counties had pledged to use its check to purchase “HazMat operations and decontamination training/supplies.” Less than a month later, in Cambridge, the Iowa section of the Dakota Access pipeline would experience its first spill.</p>\n<p>According to the standards of most state environmental agencies, it was a small spill that wouldn’t require much attention from emergency managers. On November 14, “excessive vibration” caused 21 gallons of crude to leak out of a crack in a weld connection at one of the pump stations, which are situated along pipelines to keep the product moving and monitor its flow. Since the leak was contained at the site, it went unreported to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, although it did make it into a federal pipeline monitoring database.</p>\n<p>The Dakota Access pipeline leaked at least five times in 2017. The biggest was a 168-gallon leak near DAPL’s endpoint in Patoka, Illinois, on April 23. According to federal regulators, no wildlife was impacted, although soil was contaminated, requiring remediation. DAPL went into operation on June 1, along with its under-the-radar sister project, the Energy Transfer Crude Oil pipeline, a natural gas pipeline converted to carry crude. Together, the two make up the Bakken pipeline system. ETCO leaked at least three times in 2017.</p>\n<p>Most of the Bakken system leaks were considered minor by state and federal monitors. According to regulators, water was not impacted in any of the cases. The only spill considered “significant” by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, was a 4,998-gallon leak on the ETCO pipeline in Dyersburg, Tennessee, on June 19. Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation spokesperson Kim Schofinski told The Intercept that reporting the spill to the agency was not required because it was contained within the pumping station where it occurred.</p>\n<p>The series of spills in the pipelines’ first months of operation underlines a fact that regulators and industry insiders know well: Pipelines leak.</p>\n<p>To regulators like Bill Suess, who deals with a crude oil spill nearly every day as North Dakota’s spill investigation program manager, it’s the nature of the game. “A tanker truck rolls over and spills 7,000 gallons of crude oil, and nobody pays attention. Twenty gallons spill on DAPL, it makes world news, so it’s kind of funny,” he told The Intercept.</p>\n<p>But Winona LaDuke, an Ojibwe environmental activist who was involved in the anti-DAPL protests, noted that “accumulation of the little things is pretty significant.” LaDuke is now pushing to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil sands pipeline in Minnesota. The Line 3 project’s environmental impact statement has underlined that damages to tribal natural and cultural resources along that pipeline’s pathway are “not quantifiable” and “cannot be mitigated.” “Somebody lives there,” LaDuke said. “Maybe that somebody who lives there is a little animal; maybe that somebody who lives there is a little plant. All of those are beings.”</p>\n<p>Lisa Dillinger, a spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners, told The Intercept, “All of these minor issues occurred within our easement at either valve sites or pump stations and did not go beyond our workspace.” She noted that four leaks occurred before the pipeline system went into service during a testing period and were contained on a protective liner, although PHMSA notes that those incidents involved soil contamination. Three leaks occurred at pump stations after the pipeline was fully operational and were isolated to a “concrete work area,” Dillinger said.</p>\n<p>ETP has denied responsibility for a spill that occurred on March 3 on a feeder line that transports oil from the well where it’s extracted to the main Dakota Access Pipeline. The 84-gallon leak produced “a mist that settled on top of the snow” but penetrated to the ground in a 200-square-foot area, where contaminated soil and snow were removed by a vacuum truck. Caliber Midstream, the company behind the feeder line, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>“We understand there are varying opinions on infrastructure projects,” Dillinger told The Intercept, but pipelines are the “safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport the oil and gas products we use every day.”</p>\n<p>Anne Rolfes, head of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which is fighting ETP’s proposed Bayou Bridge Pipeline, said the company’s argument about safety is unproven. “The company has an accident problem,” she said, adding that state agencies’ view of the spills as minor “just shows how problematic our so-called regulatory system is.”</p>\n<div data-credit=\"Graphic: The Intercept\" data-columns=\"2\" data-size=\"xtra-large\" data-photos=\"%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F01%5C%2Fbakken1e-1515522164.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F01%5C%2Fbakken2e-1515522166.jpg%22%7D%5D\"></div>\n<p><u>Beyond the Bakken</u> system, spills of clay-based drilling fluid on two of ETP’s newest projects have drawn attention before fuel even entered the pipelines.</p>\n<p>In Pennsylvania, construction of the Mariner East 2 pipeline, which is owned by Energy Transfer Partners via its subsidiary Sunoco, was shut down by regulators last Wednesday after Sunoco repeatedly drilled under waterways without permits. The 350-mile pipeline would carry ethane, butane, and propane from the Marcellus Shale fracking area to an export facility near Philadelphia. Suspension of construction “is necessary to correct the egregious and willful violations” by Sunoco, said the shutdown order issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania regulators documented more than 100 spills of drilling fluid, ranging in size from 1 gallon to 160,000 gallons, entering creeks, lakes, wetlands, and fields since May. In at least two separate incidents, the fluid entered private wells, clouding drinking water and requiring locals to switch to Sunoco-provided bottled water.</p>\n<p>According to Neil Shader, spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, lubricating drilling fluid is expected to leak when pipeline builders bore under streams. When a pipeline crosses a waterway, builders can either divert the water flow and build a big trench into which the pipeline is buried, or they can drill under the stream using a method called horizontal directional drilling. Both techniques can be environmentally disruptive, but they have distinct challenges — horizontal directional drilling, for example, requires gallons of so-called drilling mud, typically a mix of bentonite clay and water, to be pumped into the ground as the drilling takes place.</p>\n<p>According to Shader, pressure causes the drilling fluid to look for pathways of escape, which is how leaks happen. Shader stressed that the fluid is required to be nontoxic, although, he added, “I’d imagine it doesn’t taste very good.”</p>\n<p>Because of the risk, permits are required in advance of drilling. In Pennsylvania, Sunoco repeatedly failed to get permits before boring under tributaries to state-designated wild trout streams, which require special protection.</p>\n<p>“Even though it’s nontoxic, there can still be environmental impacts,” Shader said of the drilling fluid. “A lot of the bugs and other macro-invertebrates that fish feed on thrive in a loose, gravelly stream bed. If you then cover that with mud, it covers up their habitat.”</p>\n<p>The department demanded documentation of each instance Sunoco had installed a section of the Mariner East 2 pipeline under a wild trout stream and an explanation of the failures that led to permit violations, as well a plan as to how the company would conduct its construction moving forward. Additionally, the department has called for the company to address all alleged impacts to water wells in the Silver Spring Township, where wells were contaminated by unpermitted drilling, including restoration or replacement of the water supply and reimbursement for any costs.</p>\n<p>“We are working with the DEP to resolve all issues connected with our environmental permits and look forward to promptly returning to work on this important pipeline project,” ETP spokesperson Dillinger told The Intercept. She added that construction of Mariner East 2 was 91 percent complete, and horizontal directional drilling was 62 percent finished.</p>\n<p>Energy Transfer Partners is also behind the 700-mile natural gas pipeline Rover, which last spring spilled 2 million gallons of drilling mud into an Ohio wetland, which “coated the area with a layer of mud and impacted water quality.” Regulators found traces of diesel fuel in samples taken from the spill. Shader said that diesel contamination of drilling fluid is “incredibly unusual.” An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-17/blackstone-s-new-pipeline-asset-is-wreaking-environmental-havoc\">analysis</a> by Bloomberg in August found that Rover had “racked up more environmental violations than other major interstate natural gas pipelines built in the last two years.”</p>\n<p>In November, Ohio’s attorney general <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2017/Ohio-Files-Lawsuit-Against-Rover-Pipeline-for-Envi\">sued</a> ETP’s Rover Pipeline LLC for its environmental violations and unpermitted activity after the company refused to pay $2.3 million in fines. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced the company to halt Rover construction for several months after the massive spill, although it was allowed to restart in September.</p>\n<p>Elise Gerhart, whose family land in the pathway of Mariner East 2 is home to the anti-pipeline Camp White Pine, told The Intercept that she believes the ME2 project’s suspension was largely a product of community organizing along the pipeline. However, she’s skeptical that it will result in meaningful changes to Sunoco’s construction practices. “It seems like a false thing to me, like when Obama supposedly halted the Dakota Access pipeline.” In December 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under President Barack Obama denied ETP a permit to drill underneath Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system, and ordered an environmental impact statement for the project. However, Donald Trump had already been elected to the presidency, and within his first days in office, he issued an order to expedite permitting. The pipeline was installed under the lake soon afterward.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s big accidents like the November 16 spill on TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline, when 210,000 gallons of crude spilled onto farmland in Amherst, South Dakota, that regulators and pipeline opponents worry most about. Keystone’s proposed sister project, the Keystone XL pipeline, launched the national anti-pipeline movement.</p>\n<p>Since the November spill, massive truckloads of contaminated soil have been hauled away. According to a filing with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, groundwater was impacted 6 feet below the surface, although TransCanada reported that testing of two local drinking water wells showed contamination below Environmental Protection Agency safety levels. The pipeline restarted operations less than two weeks after the spill.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Sections of pipe sit at an Energy Transfer Partners construction site for the Sunoco Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline project near Morgantown, Pa., on Aug. 4, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/dakota-access-pipeline-leak-energy-transfer-partners/\">Five Spills, Six Months in Operation: Dakota Access Track Record Highlights Unavoidable Reality — Pipelines Leak</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

But these are not formal restrictions, and they can easily be circumvented by having Noreika consult with bank clients privately, imparting his insider knowledge of how bank examiners operate. </span></p>\n<p>Like all OCC employees, Noreika is barred from representing clients before the government on matters in which he specifically participated as a federal employee. But most of the issues Noreika worked on were general in nature — he recused himself from specific issues involving his former clients — so the rules would not prevent him from representing a bank on a specific case.</p>\n<p><span>Banks were very happy with Noreika’s performance as OCC chair, he informed the Wall Street Journal. “I haven’t really even heard a negative word.”</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: Keith Noreika, acting comptroller of the currency, speaks during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, June 22, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/keith-noreika-occ-trump-simpson-thacher/\">Swamp Watch: Trump’s Top Banking Regulator Heads Back to His Wall Street Clients</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>With major NSA</u> surveillance authorities set to expire later this month, House Republicans are rushing to pass a bill that would not only reauthorize existing powers, but also codify into law some practices that critics have called unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The bill takes aim at reforming how federal law enforcement can use data collected by the National Security Agency, putting a modest constraint on when the FBI can conduct so-called backdoor searches of Americans’ communications. But because such searches make use of a legal loophole, critics say the current bill may do more harm than good by explicitly writing the practice into law.</p>\n<p>The bill would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which serves as the basis for some of the NSA’s largest surveillance programs, and keep it on the books through 2023. The law was first passed in 2008 after the George W. Bush administration’s secret warrantless wiretapping was made public, effectively to legalize what the administration was doing.</p>\n<p>The law allows the intelligence community to spy on Americans’ transnational communications without a warrant so long as the “targets” are not Americans. In 2013, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/07/01/nsas-google-worlds-private-communications/\">documents</a> leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA vacuums up a tremendous amount of wholly domestic communications through the program as well.</p>\n<p>Republicans tried to ram through a different incarnation of the bill last month, based on a more draconian version passed by the House Intelligence Committee. During a daylong push to drum up support, Republicans on the committee circulated <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/why-fisa-amendments-act-unconstitutional\">fliers</a> depicting enlarged photos of Islamic State fighters, trying to give the impression that failing to pass that bill would be a gift to foreign terrorists. But leadership backed off after determining they didn’t have enough votes to pass it, according to multiple congressional sources. Domestic surveillance is the rare issue on which hard-right Republicans and left-leaning privacy advocates often find common ground.</p>\n<p>The new version of the bill, posted on the Rules Committee <a href=\"http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180108/BILLS-115S139-RCP115-%2053.pdf\">website</a> late Friday, is designed to get the buy-in of Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. It includes compromise language taken from a separate bill passed out of that committee in November, which included some modest limitations on existing authorities, including the reform to backdoor searches.</p>\n<p>The bill takes aim at one of the key problems with the original law: that Section 702 doesn’t limit how data can be used by federal law enforcement. That has given rise to the backdoor search loophole, in which the NSA shares certain kinds of information with the FBI, which the FBI then uses to search for Americans’ communications without a warrant.</p>\n<p>Privacy advocates have called backdoor searches unconstitutional and urged Congress to close the loophole by requiring the FBI to get a court order to query Americans’ communications. The current bill takes a crack at doing so, requiring the FBI to get a warrant before searching the data in relation to an open criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>But the bill carves out large exceptions. The FBI doesn’t have to apply for a warrant when national security is involved, or when it determines that there is a “threat to life or serious bodily harm.” And the bill would continue to allow the FBI to sift through the data even when those searches don’t involve a specific criminal investigation, which the FBI already does so often that they have compared it to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/21/in-secret-court-hearing-lawyer-objected-to-fbi-sifting-through-nsa-data-like-it-was-google/\">searching Google</a>.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"center\">The FBI doesn’t have to apply for a warrant when national security is involved, or when it determines a “threat to life or serious bodily harm.”</blockquote>\n<p>Daniel Schuman, policy director for digital rights organization Demand Progress, said the new bill essentially codifies illegal backdoor searches, while failing to effectively limit them.</p>\n<p>“The Intelligence Committee’s bill disregards the Constitution and common sense by granting the government the authority to search Americans’ communications without first obtaining a warrant,” Schuman told The Intercept. “Not only does this turn the purpose of the foreign surveillance law on its head, transforming it into a domestic surveillance tool, but it places activists, minorities, and everyone else at the mercy of President Trump and Attorney General Sessions, who have made clear their disregard for legal constraints and democratic norms.”</p>\n<p>The bill also addresses a second area of advocates’ concerns: “about” collection, in which the NSA scans communications, including those involving Americans, to find those that merely mention a target’s selector — like an email address — somewhere in the message. After arguing for years that it was necessary to detect terror plots, the NSA <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/nsa-surveillance-terrorism-privacy.html\">discontinued the practice</a> in April after it was found to violate rules imposed by the FISA court.</p>\n<p>The bill codifies the end of “about” collection into law, but instead of a permanent prohibition, it provides a pathway for the practice to legally continue in an ad hoc way. It allows the Director of National Intelligence to notify Congress of the intent to restart “about” collection on an emergency basis, provided that the DNI tells Congress and the FISA court. Barring objections from either, the NSA can keep doing it.</p>\n<p>It is unclear how much support the bill will have from Republicans. Several Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus, like Justin Amash, R-Mich., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., have already come out against it, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/949432306439159809\">saying</a> it’s unconstitutional for the U.S. to amass data on Americans without a warrant. The American Civil Liberties Union also released a statement of opposition Friday, saying the bill “risks being read as a codification and expansion of certain illegal government practices,” such as “about” collection.</p>\n<p>The bill is scheduled to be considered by the Rules Committee on Tuesday and could come up for a vote as early as Thursday, according to multiple congressional sources familiar with the process.</p>\n<p>Top photo: President Donald Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, center, and FBI Director Christopher Wray stand during the national anthem at the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony, Friday, Dec. 15, 2017, in Quantico, Va.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/nsa-surveillance-fisa-section-702-reauthorization-fbi/\">NSA Surveillance Bill Would Legalize Loophole That Lets FBI Spy on Americans Without a Warrant</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span><u>President Donald Trump</u> inherited an unprecedented number of federal judicial vacancies, and he’s rushing to fill these lifetime appointments with deeply conservative judges as fast as possible. Democrats, optimistic after surprising election victories and Trump’s continued implosion, are looking happily at the prospect of retaking the White House in 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span>But the judicial takeover, depending on how complete, could imperil Democrats ability to turn a new mandate into legislation, as </span><span>the increasing activist streak among the new crop of conservative jurists would put Democratic policymakers on a constitutional collision course with Republican judges. </span></p>\n<p><span>And with a significant number of Supreme Court justices approaching retirement or mortality, the highest chamber threatens to tilt just as dramatically to the right. The current Supreme Court managed to deem an expansion of Medicaid an unconstitutional overreach, leaving it to the states to decide the matter. Who’s to say a more extreme court wouldn’t do the same or worse with Medicare for All?</span></p>\n<p><span>The only way to stop the seizure of the judiciary is for Democrats to win the Senate in November. It may be the most important and least discussed political battle under way. </span></p>\n<p><span>The arrival of Alabama Democrat Doug Jones narrowed Republicans’ hold on the Senate to a single seat, 51-49, but also brought hope that the needle-threading needed to seize the chamber may actually be possible. By numbers alone, Democrats need two more seats; if the chamber is tied at 50-50, Vice President Mike Pence can break the tie. Democrats have all but counted their chickens in Nevada, where a deeply unpopular Sen. Dean Heller may lose his primary to </span><span>Las Vegas businessman Danny Tarkanian. If he survives, he faces Jacky Rosen in a general election Democrats expect to claim.</span></p>\n<p><span>Kyrsten Sinema, meanwhile, has a strong chance in neighboring Arizona. In Texas, Beto O’Rourke</span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/13/democrat-beto-orourke-takes-bernie-sanders-fundraising-model-local-in-run-at-ted-cruz/\"><span> is raising piles of small-dollars</span></a> <span>in his long-shot bid to knock out Ted Cruz. Trump won Texas by 9 in 2016, and won Arizona by 3.5 points.</span></p>\n<p><span>Democrats would need two of those three seats and would then need to hold on to not one, but two seats in Minnesota, where Trump nearly won in 2016, and having two Democrats on the ballot threatens to entice vote-splitting among some Midwest moderates. Democrats are also defending seats in the deep red states of Montana, Missouri, North Dakota, and Indiana. </span></p>\n<p><span>In Wisconsin — where Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has done little to distinguish herself,</span> <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tammy-baldwin-wisconsin_us_5a4bd21ce4b0b0e5a7a91159\"><span>faces a tough race</span></a><span> in a state that fell to Trump in 2016 — already has a Republican governor and senator, and right-to-work laws have ravaged organized labor. Voter suppression laws have also tipped the balance there in favor of Republicans, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/wisconsin-voters.html?_r=0\"><span>with some 17,000 voters</span></a><span> being pressured away from the ballot in 2016.</span></p>\n<p>“I think it’s too early for that,” said Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, 83, asked how concerned he was about losing the upper chamber. “I guess every House [seat] is in play. You know, the House and everybody runs…That’s why people are running, to retain control, to get control. I think if you look at the numbers, I think Republicans are going to do better than you think. But the numbers are on our side, still you have politics too as part of the equation. You know better than anyone.”</p>\n<p><span>Anyway. </span></p>\n<p><span>So far, </span><span>the Senate has confirmed 19 of Trump’s nominees, which includes one Supreme Court justice, 12 circuit court judges, and six district court judges. Trump has set the record for most federal appeals judges confirmed in the first year of a presidency; former President Barack Obama had confirmed three in his first year. </span></p>\n<p><span>Trump wields this enormous power, in part, because of the unusual number of vacancies his administration has inherited. Obama handed over 100 judicial vacancies, nearly double the</span><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Judicial_vacancies_during_Trump%27s_first_term\"> <span>54 openings</span></a><span> Obama had inherited from George W. Bush. It wasn’t by chance: Republican obstruction in the final years of Obama’s presidency boosted the record number of vacancies. But Democrats own some of the problem, too. Obama was not quick to send nominations to the Senate during the six years the party controlled the chamber. And when he was, Democrats allowed Republicans to slow them down. Former Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Pat Leahy, D-Vt., had insisted on continuing the tradition of “blue slips,” which allowed home-state senators an effective veto of a nominee for their state. Republicans had simply refused to return their blue slips, and Leahy had allowed nominations to languish. Predictably, Republicans have now cast that tradition aside.</span></p>\n<p><span>And Democrats had also allowed Republicans to filibuster nominees, declining to change the rules around judicial nominations until November 2013.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the final two years, as Senate Republicans took over, the confirmation process had ground to a halt, famously even blocking Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland for the duration of the campaign. That seat is now occupied by Justice Neil Gorsuch. </span><span>There are now</span><a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies\"> <span>149 vacancies</span></a><span>, including 137 in the U.S. courts of appeals and district courts</span><span>, with 27 nominees pending. </span></p>\n<p><span>The difference between Trump having one year or three years to fill those vacancies could be substantial.  </span></p>\n<p><span>Current Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, made it easier for Trump to appoint judges when he started ignoring Democratic blue slips</span><span>. </span><span>So there are no real tools available, besides having a majority, to stop the more reactionary nominees from moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unsurprisingly, Trump is also careening away from Obama’s efforts to diversify the nation’s federal courts — he’s nominating white men to federal courts at a rate not seen in nearly 30 years. An Associated Press</span> <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/a2c7a89828c747ed9439f60e4a89193e\"><span>analysis</span></a><span> found that, </span><span>so far, about 91 percent of these nominees are white and 81 percent are male</span><span>. Most of the white men are replacing other white men, but “</span><span>of the Trump nominees currently pending, more than a quarter are white males slated for seats have been held by women or minorities,” </span><span>according to the AP report. </span></p>\n<p><span>And as Trump continues to shape the courts, he’s met with near silence. The only real moments of controversy culminated last month when three of Trump’s nominees withdrew their names in a span of 10 days. One of the federal judicial nominees, Matthew Petersen, withdrew after he admitted he had never prosecuted or defended a case and was unable to answer basic questions about the courtroom process during his confirmation. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs0z2Ef-aEE\">clip of the exchange</a> between him and Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., went viral. Another one of the nominees, Brett Talley, a Justice Department official and ghost hunter who had also never tried a case,</span> was <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/GAO/TalleyratinglettertoGrassleyandFeinstein.authcheckdam.pdf\"><span>unanimously ruled</span></a><span> “unqualified” by the American Bar Association. Talley ultimately withdrew his name, but having an unqualified ABA rating is in itself not disqualifying: The Senate still </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-confirms-leonard-steven-grasz_us_5a2ffeefe4b01598ac486379\"><span>voted to confirm</span></a> <span>Leonard Grasz to a lifetime appointment despite being found “not qualified.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Outside of a viral exchange, </span><span>lower federal courts don’t receive the same attention the Supreme Court does, but these courts play a crucial role in the lives of Americans. Civil rights, LGBT rights, and abortion rights groups fear they could lose the progress they have made through the courts.</span></p>\n<p><span>Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., emphasized the significance of the circuit courts, pointing out in a </span><a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=72CD2AEF-1824-45A9-91A1-89394FD2D64B\"><span>statement</span></a><span> last month that t</span><span>he “Supreme Court hears between 100 and 150 cases each year out of the more than 7,000 it’s asked to review,” but in 2015 alone “more than 55,000 cases were filed in federal appeals courts.”</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: U.S. Senate Minority Leader Sen.

        "content": "<p><u>Federal agents at</u> the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration speak in veiled terms about the secret DEA unit that shares intelligence from the National Security Agency and other organizations with law enforcement for use in criminal investigations. They call it the “Dark Side.”</p>\n<p>The Special Operations Division receives raw intelligence from the NSA’s surveillance programs, including from the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/30/nsa-surveillance-fisa-section-702/\">mass surveillance programs</a> revealed in documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. DEA agents in this unit then analyze the surveillance data and disseminate leads to federal and local police nationwide. But the information comes with a catch. Law enforcement can’t use it to secure search warrants or in any way reveal the intelligence community as the source of their leads. Instead, they must find another way to justify their searches and broader investigations.</p>\n<p>An egregious example of this law enforcement tactic occurred in 2004 when, through intercepted phone calls and their own subsequent surveillance, the DEA discovered that Ascension Alverez-Tejeda was transporting drugs from Los Angeles to Washington state in his car. To search the vehicle without revealing the phone calls as their original source, DEA agents set up an elaborate ruse.</p>\n<p>Alverez-Tejeda and his girlfriend were stopped at a traffic light. As the light turned green, the car in front of them started to move and then stopped quickly. Alverez-Tejeda braked in time, but a truck rear-ended him. As Alverez-Tejeda inspected the damage, police arrived and arrested the truck driver for drunken driving. Officers instructed Alverez-Tejeda and his girlfriend to drive their car to a parking lot, leave the keys in the car, and sit in the police cruiser for processing. Just then, a car thief jumped into Alverez-Tejeda’s car and drove off. Police recovered the car, obtained a search warrant, and found cocaine and methamphetamine.</p>\n<p>Other than Alverez-Tejeda and his girlfriend, every person involved in this piece of theater was a DEA agent or local police officer: the person driving the car in front of Alverez-Tejeda’s, the “drunk” truck driver, even the supposed car thief. While a federal judge ruled that the DEA hoax violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, an appeals court overturned the ruling and described this abuse of Alverez-Tejeda’s constitutional rights as “relatively mild.”</p>\n<p>The convoluted and secretive process of building a case to obscure the use of underlying intelligence, known as “parallel construction,” is meant to protect the intelligence community’s sources and methods, according to internal DEA documents. It also often deprives the accused of a fair shot at defending themselves in court because some of the evidence against them is not made public.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">“The federal government is deliberately concealing methods used by intelligence or law enforcement agencies to identify or investigate suspects — including methods that may be illegal.”</blockquote>\n<p>The DEA’s Special Operations Division is one of several tools the government uses to hide the origins of criminal investigations nationwide, in potential violation of constitutional protections. In a report released today, “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/09/us-secret-evidence-erodes-fair-trial-rights\">Dark Side: Secret Origins of Evidence in U.S. Criminal Cases</a>,” Human Rights Watch documents the use of parallel construction by federal and local police agencies, finding the practice is used in the United States “frequently and possibly even daily.”</p>\n<p>“A growing body of evidence suggests that the federal government is deliberately concealing methods used by intelligence or law enforcement agencies to identify or investigate suspects — including methods that may be illegal,” the report states. “It does so by creating a different story about how agents discovered the information, and as a result, people may be imprisoned without ever knowing enough to challenge the potentially rights-violating origins of the cases against them.”</p>\n<p>Among Human Rights Watch’s findings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traffic stops and vehicle searches are commonly used as the pretext for investigations in order to protect the true source.</li>\n<li>Government agents use parallel construction to conceal both high-tech methods, such as the NSA’s surveillance programs, as well as crude ones, such as illegal searches of vehicles and bags.</li>\n<li>Prosecutors assist law enforcement agents in concealing the origin of investigations by telling judges and defense lawyers that they are not required to find out if certain agencies, including the NSA, were involved in the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/NSA-Michael-Rogers-1515510477.jpg\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 13:  U.S. National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers delivers remarks arguing for the renewal of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act at the Heritage Foundation October 13, 2017 in Washington, DC.

A panel of intelligence officials in 1976 lamented that if prosecutors disclosed the use of intelligence information to defendants and judges, secret surveillance “methods could be publicly revealed.” A 1983 CIA document suggested that drug agencies use intelligence information to power their investigations but that they protect that information by building “a firebreak in the evidentiary [trail] leading to sources and methods.”\n<p>Indeed, the pioneers of parallel construction appear to be drug agents. Not all federal law enforcement agencies were on board at first. The FBI was skeptical that the methods the DEA used were legal, Michael Horn, the first special agent-in-charge of the DEA’s Special Operations Division, said during a 2015 DEA panel. “When [the FBI] started seeing some success, they … kind of changed their mind,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>In a sophisticated form, parallel construction may involve the use of information from the NSA’s mass surveillance programs that is then re-obtained through the less controversial powers granted by the 1976 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. When prosecutors present the information in court, they source it to traditional FISA, rather than the more controversial mass surveillance program. The Intercept reported in November 2017 that this occurred in the case of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/30/nsa-surveillance-fisa-section-702/\">Fazliddin Kurbanov</a>, who was convicted in Idaho on terrorism-related charges. Although classified NSA documents revealed that Kurbanov’s communications had been intercepted through PRISM, a warrantless mass surveillance program, the Justice Department claimed in court that he had only been subjected to warrant-based surveillance under traditional FISA powers.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“Defendants have no way of knowing their rights have been violated.”</blockquote>\n<p>In its cruder and likely more common form, parallel construction may involve information from mass surveillance, a highly sensitive informant, or an illegal search that is then disguised. In a case Human Rights Watch discovered, security video at a New Mexico bus station showed a DEA agent illegally searching luggage left on a Greyhound bus during a layover. When passengers returned, the DEA agent asked for consent to search a passenger’s bag, already knowing that it contained methamphetamine.</p>\n<p>“Under human rights law, everybody has the right to a fair trial,” said Human Right Watch investigator Sarah St. Vincent. “And that means what it says, so when you have the government deliberately concealing investigative actions that may have been illegal, defendants have no way of knowing their rights have been violated.”</p>\n<p>Even DEA employees seem to know something untoward is afoot in the Special Operations Division, the unit that passes intelligence to law enforcement. As Arthur Rizer, a former federal prosecutor who worked in the unit, told St. Vincent: “When we all left, we got little keychains of Darth Vader.”</p>\n<p><strong>Correction: Jan. 9, 2018</strong><br>\n<em>An earlier version of this story mistakenly attributed a quote from DEA official to an interview with Human Rights Watch.

        "content": "<p><u>On Tuesday, for</u> the first time in two long years, representatives of the Koreas will meet across a polished wood table on the heavily militarized border between North and South. The room in which they’ll sit, in the village of Panmunjom, is the backdrop to numerous Korean action films. For most observers of the region, unnerved by the escalating insults of the Trump era, the talks come as good news.</p>\n<p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in, an experienced politician and human rights lawyer, campaigned on peaceful relations with Pyongyang and more equitable domestic policies. But since his inauguration in May, after the dramatic impeachment of his predecessor Park Geun-hye, Moon has presided over a government-wide audit, shaking out each ministry like a poorly laundered sheet.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">The painful history of Korean “comfort women” may figure into the nuclear standoff with North Korea — seeding tensions between Tokyo and Seoul, while easing relations between the two Koreas.</blockquote>\n<p>One result of that process has come to bear not only on domestic politics, but on regional ties as well: The painful history of Korean “comfort women” may figure into the nuclear standoff with Kim Jong Un — seeding tensions between Tokyo and Seoul (and, by extension, between Washington and Seoul), while easing relations between the two Koreas.</p>\n<p>In 2015, then-President Park, the daughter of a 1970s military dictator aligned with Tokyo, signed an agreement with Japan intended to extinguish the claims of women victimized during World War II. Then-President Barack Obama praised the deal as a “lasting settlement to this difficult issue,” while North Korea called it a “humiliating” concession to Japan. Historians estimate that some 200,000 women from areas colonized by Tokyo were conscripted as sex slaves by the imperial army. Their stories became known in the early 1990s, when Korean, Filipina, Taiwanese, and Dutch women in their 60s and 70s came forward, despite severe local stigmas, with stomach-turning stories of capture, imprisonment, and daily rape.</p>\n<p>Private Japanese charities have since offered compensation, and Japanese officials have tendered vague apologies. But the government has largely maintained that comfort women were sex workers employed in privately owned brothels, brokered by Korean middlemen. Japan has also sent emissaries to oppose the building of small monuments to comfort women — symbolized by a bronze statue of a seated girl — in far-flung Palisades Park, New Jersey, and Glendale, California.<br>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/comfort-women-statue-california-1515451387.jpg\"><img alt=\"A supporter offers flowers to a memorial statue honoring &quot;Comfort Women&quot; at Glendale Peace Monument  during a candlelight vigil in remembrance and support of &quot;Comfort Women&quot;, Japanese military sexual slavery victims during World War II, on January 5, 2016, in Glendale, California.

Unbeknownst to the public, Park had, in exchange for a dubiously constituted $8.8 million compensation fund, agreed that the Korean government would free Tokyo of legal liability, dismantle the girl statue in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul (the site of weekly protests), and disavow the term “sex slave.” No comfort women had been consulted.</p>\n<p>Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea’s foreign minister, announced that the pact would be carefully reviewed and possibly amended. (It <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/01/08/national/politics-diplomacy/six-party-reps-agree-seize-chance-peace-north-korea/#.WlPQs1Q-cUE\">now appears</a> that it will largely remain in place.) She apologized for the “incredible pain” caused to surviving grandmothers and their families, and Moon received eight comfort women to the Blue House, Seoul’s presidential residence, bowing from his waist in respect. Japan was outraged. Any re-evaluation of the agreement, the Japanese foreign minister said, would constitute a betrayal that could undermine regional responses to North Korea.</p>\n<p>The U.S. has long tried to soothe relations between South Korea and Japan, its primary allies in Asia. Mintaro Oba, who worked on Northeast Asian affairs in Obama’s State Department, said that the audit of the comfort women deal was concerning at a time when the U.S. needs “Korea and Japan to demonstrate unity and cooperation in the face of the North Korea threat and a rising China.” The comfort women issue is an unusual thread uniting China, South Korea, and North Korea. China called on Japan to proceed responsibly after the task force report was announced; North Korea’s distaste for the 2015 agreement, and Japan in general, are well known.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Despite Moon’s best efforts to pursue a more conciliatory politics, his term to date has been constrained by the uptick in North Korean missile tests and Donald Trump’s tweets.</blockquote>\n<p>This year marks the 73rd anniversary of Korean independence from Japan, followed not long after by the Koreas’ fretful separation from each other. In that time, their interests and fates have diverged to the present extreme. Relations worsened under Moon’s two predecessors, who were skeptical of any engagement with the North. And, despite Moon’s best efforts to pursue a more conciliatory politics, his term to date has been constrained by the uptick in North Korean missile tests and Donald Trump’s tweets.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the past week has been extraordinary. January began with a rapid exchange of speeches and press briefings delivered by North and South Korean leaders. There was Kim Jong Un, in a gray suit patterned after his grandfather’s, with talk of a doomsday button and mass-produced missiles, but also a wish for “<a href=\"https://www.ncnk.org/sites/default/files/KJU_2017_New_Years_Address.pdf\">the improvement of inter-Korean relations [as] the starting point for peace</a>.” The Koreas reopened their long-dormant cross-border phone line and agreed to Tuesday’s meeting; more surprising still, the U.S. abided South Korea’s request to postpone joint-military drills until after the upcoming Winter Olympics are held in Pyeongchang.</p>\n<p>The Olympics will be, for now, the main subject of conversation between the Koreas. In September, a figure-skating pair from Pyongyang, Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik, qualified for the games, but their participation, like all things inter-Korean, must be negotiated. (In 1988, the first time South Korea hosted the Olympics, North Korea was denied the chance to co-host, and boycotted.) More than 75 percent of South Koreans support the inclusion of North Korean athletes in the Olympics.</p>\n<p>Nuclear matters will not — and functionally cannot — be discussed. “South Korea understands that it must be in lockstep with the U.S., whether it wants to or not,” said Soojin Park, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a former spokesperson for the Ministry of Unification in Seoul. Moon’s progressive agenda makes him vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty to the U.S., especially among those who lived through the Korean War. “There are still a lot of constraints on how far Moon can go before inviting conservative backlash,” said Jenny Town of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. But, she added, there’s also a “feeling that what Trump is doing is pushing us closer to war.”</p>\n<p>In a recent speech to an audience of senior citizens, Moon promised to “unify the national discourse” around North Korea. His appeal to older South Koreans might be aided by his fight for the comfort women. Even before the task force made its findings known, the vast majority of the country did not accept the terms of the 2015 deal. Soojin Park says that the South Korean government, though wary of “letting this historical matter poison current international relations,” was obligated to re-examine its pact with Japan. “It’s not possible for the government to simply ignore the comfort women.”</p>\n<p><strong>Correction: January 9, 2018, 7:03 a.m.</strong><br>\nAn earlier version of this piece incorrectly identified the room in which the leaders of North and South Korea would be meeting.</p>\n<p>Top photo: In this handout photo released by the South Korean Presidential Blue House, South Korean President Moon Jae-in meets “comfort women,” former South Korean sex slaves at the Presidential Blue House on Jan. 4, 2018 in Seoul, South Korea.</p>\n<p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/08/north-south-korea-talks-comfort-women-olympics-trump/\">Japan’s Trafficking of Sex Slaves in World War II Unites North Korea and South Korea</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

He is also a resident of Long Island, an area where violence against Salvadoran immigrants at the hands of Salvadoran gangs has been particularly acute. “We are one of thousands of Salvadoran families with TPS who call Long Island home,” Serrano said in a statement Monday. “As the child of immigrants, my parents have given me the tools and support to attend college and to pursue my dreams.”</p>\n<p>“Any decision to end TPS is thoughtless and cruel, and it would achieve nothing but splitting apart families like mine,” he added.</p>\n<p>The decision to cancel TPS for Salvadorans is part of a broader campaign <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/26/haitians-temporary-protected-status-sudan-trump/\">targeting the program</a>, which previously included the end of protections for <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/22/canada-prepares-for-a-new-wave-of-refugees-as-haitians-flee-trumps-america/\">tens of thousands of citizens from Haiti</a>, Nicaragua, and Sudan currently living in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In a phone call with reporters Monday, senior Trump administration officials sought to portray the decision as merely the result of a program that had run its course. The latest iteration of TPS designations for Salvadorans began in 2001, after a pair of earthquakes devastated the country. The program has been renewed continually since then and, in the view of many immigration hawks, become an unnecessary burden on the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security “considered a wide variety of information when making this decision,” a senior administration official said during Monday’s press call, adding that “following the 2001 earthquakes, El Salvador received a significant amount of international aid to assist in its recovery efforts, including millions of dollars dedicated to emergency and long-term assistance. Accordingly, many reconstruction efforts have now been completed — damaged schools and hospitals have been reconstructed and repaired, homes have been rebuilt, and money has been provided for water and sanitation and to repair damaged roads and other infrastructure.”</p>\n<p>“Additionally,” the Trump official added, “El Salvador’s economy is steadily improving.”</p>\n<p>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity for no discernible reason, provided no evidence for the claim. In 2016, the World Bank reported that while “economic growth in El Salvador reached 2.4 percent,” the country remained “the slowest growing economy of Central America.” The Trump official added that the TPS decision followed conversations with political and diplomatic stakeholders in El Salvador, as well as Salvadoran community groups in the U.S., though he declined to characterize what sort of feedback the administration received from those parties.</p>\n<p>Salvadoran officials, including President Salvador Sánchez Cerén, appealed to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as recently as last week not to go through with the decision, arguing that it would wreak havoc on El Salvador’s economy. The tiny Central American nation relies heavily on remittance payments sent from Salvadorans living in the U.S. to their family members back home.</p>\n<p>The long-anticipated decision was met with outrage among immigration advocates and supporters. In a statement, Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez, D-Ill., said, “The White House is peddling a fantasy where hundreds of thousands of people who have established their lives, families, and businesses in the U.S. for decades will leave or can be rounded up and deported.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/GettyImages-859854120-1515444862.jpg\"><img alt=\"Students of the National Institute Francisco Menendez participate in an earthquake drill, on the 31st anniversary of the 1986 quake  that severely affected the country, in San Salvador on October 10, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / MARVIN RECINOS        (Photo credit should read MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/Getty Images)\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/GettyImages-859854120-1515444862-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165085\"></a>\n<p>Students of the National Institute Francisco Menendez participate in an earthquake drill in San Salvador on Oct. 10, 2017.</p>\n<p>Photo: Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><u>By pointing to</u> earthquake recovery efforts alone, the Trump administration appears intent on keeping the conversation about the end of TPS confined to the justifications for starting the program in the first place. In doing so, however, consideration of other critical factors related to conditions on the ground in El Salvador are conspicuously avoided, including, in particular, violence and instability.</p>\n<p>The recent history of the U.S.’s relationship to El Salvador is laden with sweeping decisions made in Washington or other American cities. The decisions and policies frequently overlook or dismiss second- and third-order effects, creating new problems the governments of both countries are forced to grapple with years down the road.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, for instance, the U.S. backed the Salvadoran military and its death squads in a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that left tens of thousands of people dead or disappeared. The civil war helped fuel an exodus of refugees to the U.S., with many Salvadorans landing in cities like Los Angeles — the first use of TPS was, in fact, designed as a protection for Salvadorans fleeing the conflict. Growing up in struggling communities, some first-generation Salvadorans came together to protect themselves against American street gangs, sparking the creation of Salvadoran criminal groups such as Mara Salvatrucha, otherwise known as MS-13.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">The so-called Northern Triangle, which includes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, has been routinely described as the most violent region of the world outside of conventional war zones.</blockquote>\n<p>Following the end of the civil war in the early 1990s, the U.S. began deporting Salvadorans in large numbers. With El Salvador’s weak institutions incapable of responding to the influx of violent actors, gangs like MS-13 steadily gained power in El Salvador itself, which in turn gave rise to an increasing number of Salvadoran civilians fleeing to the U.S. border seeking asylum. The cycle was evident in a surge of Central American refugees arriving at the U.S. border during the Obama administration, many of them Salvadoran families and unaccompanied children.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the so-called Northern Triangle, which includes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, has been routinely described as the most violent region of the world outside of conventional war zones. The inability of the Salvadoran government to protect its people — not only from gangs but also from its own unaccountable security forces — is a critical factor in why TPS recipients and their advocates have argued for the program to remain in place. Indeed, gang violence was among the factors the U.S. government cited in renewing TPS for Salvadorans in 2016, and there is scant evidence to indicate a dramatic improvement on that front in the year since.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has been more than willing to point to the existence of groups like MS-13 as justification for an immigration crackdown that includes the targeting of virtually all of the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. At the same time, however, the threat that those criminal groups would pose to individuals returned to El Salvador — individuals who have raised families in the U.S. and contributed to society and the American economy — apparently mattered little in the TPS deliberations.</p>\n<p>In Monday’s call with reporters, the Trump administration official was explicit in saying that violence and instability in El Salvador was not part of the calculus in deciding to end TPS — it was earthquake recovery and earthquake recovery alone. “Anything else doesn’t really apply,” the official said. When asked if it was the administration’s position that families with mixed citizenship status should expect to return to a country frequently called the murder capital of the world, the official had no advice: “We’re not getting involved in individual family decisions.”</p>\n<p><strong>Correction: Jan. 9, 2018, 11:09 a.m.<br>\n</strong><em>An earlier version of this story referred to the Golden Triangle region of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

While Oprah has in the past <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/860660/oprah-winfrey-talks-politics-i-will-never-run-for-public-office\">ruled out</a> running for public office, her longtime partner Stedman Graham just told the Los Angeles Times that <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mog-golden-globes-oprah-president-20180107-story.html\">“she would absolutely do it,”</a> and CNN is reporting that Oprah is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/08/media/oprah-golden-globes/index.html\">“actively thinking”</a> about running for president.</p>\n<p>Is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oprah2020?src=hash\">#Oprah2020</a> really a serious thing?

I’m old enough to remember when liberals gave a damn about experience, qualifications, and judgement; when Democrats mocked the idea of Trump — a former reality TV star and property developer who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/04/donald-trump-difference-between-hamas-hezbollah-quds-kurds\">struggled to tell the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah</a> — running for the presidency.</p>\n<p>On the campaign trail, former President Barack Obama blasted Trump as “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/obama-trump-unlike-romney-or-mccain-is-uniquely-unqualified-opponent-799398979984\">uniquely unqualified</a>,” lacking in “<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/07/27/obama-hillary-great-president-trump-performer-sot-lv.cnn\">basic knowledge</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-trump-226564\">woefully unprepared</a>” to do the job of commander-in-chief.

President Winfrey would be the second such president. Is this really what most Americans want or what the United States government needs? Another clueless celebrity in possession of the nuclear codes? Another billionaire mogul who <a href=\"https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/oprah-hates-writing-checks-to-the-irs\">doesn’t like paying taxes</a> in charge of the economy? And how would it be anything other than sheer hypocrisy for Democrats to offer an unqualified, inexperienced presidential candidate to the American electorate in 2020, given all that they said about Trump in 2016?</p>\n<p>Granted, Oprah isn’t a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/07/worried-about-trumps-mental-stability-the-worst-is-yet-to-come/\">raging narcissist</a> or a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/15/donald-trump-has-been-a-racist-all-his-life-and-he-isnt-going-to-change-after-charlottesville/\">racist bigot</a>; she doesn’t have ties to white nationalists, isn’t accused of colluding with a foreign government, and hasn’t been caught on tape admitting to sexual assault. Oprah would be a far superior, smarter, and more stable president than Trump in every imaginable way. But that, of course, is a low, <em>low</em> bar.</p>\n<p>As CNBC’s Christina Wilkie, in a rare dissent on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/950227600034746368\">put it</a>: “I love to watch Oprah saying inspirational things on television. But also I love to watch people who have political experience being elected to national office.”</p>\n<p>What about former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan, some Oprah supporters might say? The Gipper, however, was also a former two-term governor from California. Obama, also accused of being a political lightweight when he ran for president, was a sitting senator, former constitutional law professor, and author of two acclaimed books on politics and policy. Even the know-nothing George W. Bush had won two gubernatorial elections in Texas before throwing his hat in the presidential ring in 2000.</p>\n<p>Prior to Trump, the only presidents to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13587532/donald-trump-no-experience\">never have served in public office</a> prior to being elected to the White House were Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, and Dwight Eisenhower. The first won the Mexican-American War; the second, the Civil War; and the third, the Second World War.</p>\n<p>Does Oprah have anything on her resume to compare with that? Is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/16/showbiz/tv/oprah-winfrey-confessional-tv/index.html\">emoting on TV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcJAWKdawuM\">handing out free cars</a> — even if it is, admittedly, part of building an impressive multi-billion-dollar media empire from scratch — really an acceptable substitute for political or military experience? Is that how debased the political culture has become?</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/oprah-winfrey-2-1515442973.jpg\"><img alt=\"MEYERTON, HENLEY ON KLIP - JANUARY 14:  Oprah Winfrey poses with the Graduates at the inaugural graduation of the class of 2011 at Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls on January 14, 2012 in Henley on Klip, South Africa.

Perhaps. But what’s wrong with wanting people with intellect, experience, and qualifications to fill the most important jobs? As Oprah’s fellow celebrity liberal Jon Stewart <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2008/1001/p09s02-coop.html\">once said</a>: “Not only do I want an elite president, I want someone who’s embarrassingly superior to me, somebody who speaks 16 languages and sleeps two hours a night hanging upside down in a chamber they themselves designed.”</p>\n<p>Well, the Oprah fans might argue, she could surround herself with big brains. But isn’t that the argument that Trump supporters make, too? Do we really want another president deferring to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-generals-have-trump-surrounded/2017/08/23/ccab06a8-8817-11e7-a94f-3139abce39f5_story.html\">unelected generals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/03/15/anyone-left-goldman-sachs-trump-picks-another-alum-treasury-deputy\">Goldman Sachs</a>? And do we think a talk-show host who promoted the careers of hucksters <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/doctor-why-quack-tv-docs-like-dr-oz-and-dr-phil-need-to-go\">Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz</a>, while also <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-ways-oprah-winfrey-changed-world-for-worse/\">giving a platform</a> to the anti-science lunacy of actresses Jenny McCarthy and Suzanne Somers, is capable of constructing a Lincoln-esque <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/11/15/165220138/doris-kearns-goodwin-on-lincoln-and-his-team-of-rivals\">“Team of Rivals”</a>? A political and economic “Justice League?” Come. Off. It.</p>\n<p>To be clear: I am not saying that Oprah can’t, or won’t, be president. Predictions are for fools, and Trump has proved that anything is possible.</p>\n<p>Oprah’s supporters — rightly — might point to her strong record on standing up to racism and misogyny, not to mention her inspirational oratory and backstory. Her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah%27s_Anti-war_series\">record on Iraq</a> is better than Clinton’s; she once even <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/health/sick-in-america-it-can-happen-to-you_2\">hosted a show on universal health care</a> with Michael Moore. It might also seem like an act of divine justice if Trump, hero to white nationalists and neo-Nazis, was replaced by a strong black woman.</p>\n<p>Oprah’s critics — also rightly — might point to her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/oprah-weight-watchers-corporations-profit-flesh-food-giants\">fronting for global corporations</a> and her role as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/09/oprah-winfrey-neoliberal-capitalist-thinkers\">one of the world’s best neoliberal capitalist thinkers</a>.” They might ask: What is Oprah’s position on drone strikes in Pakistan? On supporting the Saudi war in Yemen? On cap and trade? Single-payer? Tax reform? Does she have a plan for Middle East peace? Could a person who once seemed surprised that Indian people still “<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-18967127\">eat with their hands</a>” really defuse a nuclear crisis on the Indian subcontinent?</p>\n<p>But we have to go beyond the pros and cons of an Oprah presidency — I can’t believe I just typed that line — and consider some broader questions: How much damage is U.S. celebrity culture doing to U.S. politics? Why don’t ideologies, or even ideas, seem to matter anymore? Shouldn’t progressives be making the case for the virtues of government and collective action and, therefore, the importance of electing people of ability, experience, and expertise to high office? Shouldn’t they be arguing that billionaire TV stars have no business running for the most powerful job on planet Earth, regardless of whether they are an orange man called Trump or a black woman called Oprah?</p>\n<p>Some pundits have suggested that the Democrats can’t win without a celebrity candidate like Oprah in 2020. “If you need to set a thief to catch a thief,” neoconservative John Podhoretz wrote in a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/09/27/democrats-best-hope-for-2020-oprah/\">New York Post op-ed</a> in September 2017 that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oprah/status/913551310628184064?lang=en\">retweeted</a> by Oprah herself, “you need a star — a grand, outsized, fearless star whom Trump can neither intimidate nor outshine — to catch a star.”</p>\n<p>This simply isn’t true. In August 2017, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/342521-poll-trump-trails-behind-high-profile-dems-in-hypothetical-matchups\">Public Policy Polling</a> found Trump trailed Joe Biden (by 15 points), Bernie Sanders (14 points), Elizabeth Warren (7 points), Cory Booker (5 points), and Kamala Harris (1 point) in potential 2020 match-ups. Last month, an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-just-36-americans-indicate-they-would-vote-trump-2020-n831266\">NBC/Wall Street Journal poll </a>found Trump would lose to a “Generic Democrat” in 2020 by a whopping 16 points.</p>\n<p>If five different senators plus a Generic Democrat can beat this Republican president, then why the liberal excitement over a talk-show host? And why draw the line at Oprah? What about <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/mark-zuckerberg-could-be-running-for-president-in-2020.html\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>? <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-advised-mark-cuban-to-consider-running-in-2020-as-a-democrat\">Mark Cuban</a>? <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/dwayne-johnson-seriously-considering-running-for-president-w514003\">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a>? <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kanye-west-outlines-why-he-wants-to-run-for-president-in-2020-im-not-saying-i-have-any-political-a7166561.html\">Kanye</a>? Where, oh where, does it end?</p>\n<p>The liberal response to the rise of Trump cannot and should not be “let’s find our own bigger, better version of The Donald.” As columnist Emily Arrowood <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-05-17/even-if-donald-trump-were-a-saint-hed-still-be-unqualified-for-president\">wrote</a> in May 2016: “That Trump is acutely unqualified would be true even if he were Mr. Congeniality, a champion of the people with the aspirations of Jimmy Stewart in ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.’”</p>\n<p>The irony is that Oprah may, in fact, <em>be</em> Ms. Congeniality. But she is still as “acutely unqualified” as Trump. Let’s get a grip, folks.</p>\n<p>Top photo: In this handout photo provided by NBCUniversal, Oprah Winfrey speaks onstage during the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/08/oprah-winfrey-president-2020-trump/\">Oprah Winfrey for President: Have We All Gone Bonkers?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Não há uma trama</u> propriamente dita no episódio “Metalhead” da nova temporada da série “Black Mirror”. O protagonista do episódio é um robozinho preto nada comunicativo, que anda de quatro e tem uma pistola armazenada na perna da frente. Não se sabe quem controla o robô, se é que há alguém. A criatura mecânica de quatro patas aparentemente opera por conta própria, com seus próprios objetivos. Ao longo do episódio de 40 minutos, ele persegue uma mulher que foge desesperadamente por uma floresta, tentando em vão escapar de seus sensores.</p>\n<p>“Black Mirror”, para quem não sabe, é uma série de ficção científica da <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/70264888\">Netflix</a> sobre um futuro próximo em que novas tecnologias trazem terríveis e inesperadas consequências para nossas vidas, limitando a autonomia individual, comprometendo os valores sociais e até desencadeando uma violência incontrolável. Embora aterrorizantes, no entanto, as tecnologias mostradas no programa não são inusitadas. A exemplo do robozinho autônomo de “Metalhead”, elas refletem avanços que podemos facilmente imaginar, bastante próximos de tecnologias já existentes, como os drones.</p>\n<p>Desde as primeiras detonações de bombas atômicas no século XX, a cultura pop vem desenvolvendo um fascínio mórbido pelo fato de a humanidade poder construir ferramentas suficientemente poderosas para se autodestruir. As tecnologias maléficas mostradas em “Black Mirror”, porém, são mais sutis que as armas nucleares. A maioria dos episódios trata de avanços de robótica, vigilância, realidade virtual e inteligência artificial – áreas consideradas essenciais pelas empresas de tecnologia do mundo real. Os criadores da série demonstram como a lógica interna dessas novas tecnologias pode levar à destruição de seus usuários, caso não sejam implementados meios de controle.</p>\n<p>Além da produção cuidadosa e da qualidade das atuações de “Black Mirror”, aspectos aclamados pela crítica, a análise social que faz a série parece ter atingido um ponto nevrálgico para um público que começa a sentir confusão, medo e alienação em relação aos desdobramentos das novas tecnologias. Um <a href=\"https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2015/10/13/americas-top-fears-2015/\">estudo</a> de 2015 da Universidade de Chapman descobriu que três dos cinco principais medos dos norte-americanos estavam relacionados às consequências das tecnologias emergentes. O potencial da automação para eliminar milhões de postos de trabalho e o da inteligência artificial para enfraquecer a democracia já são bem documentados. Mas também ajudaram a criar um ambiente de crescente pessimismo fenômenos como os assassinatos transmitidos ao vivo, o recrutamento online de terroristas e as ameaças de apocalipse nuclear por meio das mídias sociais.</p>\n<p>Vale a pena refletir sobre como chegamos a esse ponto.</p>\n<p>Em 1992, antes da popularização da internet, o teórico da comunicação e crítico social Neil Postman escreveu um pequeno livro chamado “Tecnopólio: a rendição da cultura à tecnologia”. Ele argumentava que a ideia moderna de tecnologia estava se tornando perigosamente distorcida. Em vez de desenvolver novas tecnologias para atingir objetivos publicamente conhecidos, começamos a considerar o avanço tecnológico um fim em si mesmo. Sem um contexto cultural e político forte o suficiente para determinar o que deveria ser inventado e por quê, estaríamos sujeitos ao risco de corromper nossa cultura cívica e nossa democracia diante das novas e poderosas tecnologias que operavam segundo uma lógica própria. Postman alertava que logo começaríamos a precisar nos adaptar às necessidades de nossas invenções, e não o contrário.</p>\n<p>“Black Mirror” retrata uma versão de pesadelo das previsões de Postman. Adotadas sem senso crítico, apenas na crença de que podem melhorar nossas vidas, tecnologias como a realidade virtual e as redes sociais tornam-se gradualmente veículos para o controle social autoritário, ou mesmo para a escravização de seus usuários. A série reflete uma tendência crescente na cultura pop. Nos últimos anos, outras séries de ficção científica como “Westworld” e “H+” também se concentraram no lado obscuro das tecnologias emergentes, incluindo a robótica e a inteligência artificial. No seu mais recente livro “Why Liberalism Failed” [“Por que o liberalismo fracassou”, em tradução livre, sem edição no Brasil], o professor de ciência política da Universidade de Notre Dame, Patrick Deneen, entende que:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A maior parte dos exemplos desse gênero recente reflete um pressentimento disseminado e uma sensação comum de impotência, e até mesmo de potencial aprisionamento à própria tecnologia que deveria nos libertar. Esses filmes e séries mostram como estamos subjugados de várias formas às mesmas tecnologias que, tomados pelo otimismo excessivo e por uma certa vaidade, acreditamos que nos levariam a uma nova era de liberdade. Estamos longe de controlar a tecnologia para nosso o bem, ela vai acabar nos governando ou nos destruindo.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A impotência que muitos sentem diante das novas tecnologias também pode estar relacionada à natureza nada democrática de seu desenvolvimento. As pessoas costumam temer algo de que dependem, mas que não conseguem compreender ou controlar — e isso é natural. Nos últimos 10 a 15 anos, muitas normas sociais e políticas tradicionais foram esvaziadas pelas tecnologias que contribuíram, nos EUA, para a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/\">crise de credibilidade</a> da democracia. As empresas do Vale do Silício têm sido muito pouco transparentes em relação às implicações futuras de seus programas de pesquisa e desenvolvimento, que muitos norte-americanos consideram, com razão, que <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/210728/one-four-workers-say-technology-eliminate-job.aspx\">podem levar à extinção de seus empregos</a>.</p>\n<p>Quando os grandes executivos se pronunciam, costumam fazer afirmações perturbadoras sobre o fim iminente de normas sociais muito apreciadas, como a privacidade individual. Numa entrevista concedida em 2010, o presidente do Facebook Mark Zuckerberg afirmou que “logo vão acabar os dias de ter uma imagem para seus amigos ou colegas de trabalho e outra para as outras pessoas que você conhece”, e declarou ainda que “ter duas identidades é um exemplo de falta de integridade”.</p>\n<p>Mesmo que nunca venham a se concretizar as <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-warning-destroy-civilization-703630\">previsões</a> mais preocupantes sobre a destruição da humanidade por programas de inteligência artificial fora de controle, já <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">abrimos mão de muita autonomia individual</a> em prol de tecnologias cujas filosofias subjacentes não estavam claras quando foram apresentadas ao público. Há uma reação crescente a esse tipo de autoritarismo corporativo. Aumentam as propostas para <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-20/should-america-s-tech-giants-be-broken-up\">desmembrar as empresas de tecnologia</a> à luz da legislação antitruste, ao mesmo tempo em que ex-executivos do Vale do Silício um tanto desiludidos começam a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/facebook-former-executive-ripping-society-apart\">soltar o verbo</a> sobre os efeitos colaterais negativos dos programas que ajudaram a desenvolver. O utopismo tecnológico está aos poucos dando lugar ao reconhecimento de que a tecnologia não é neutra, e que é papel de uma sociedade funcional controlar seu uso.</p>\n<p>O robô do episódio “Metalhead” de “Black Mirror” foi inspirado em um robô real, desenvolvido pela empresa de engenharia Boston Dynamics. Denominado SpotMini, é descrito por seus criadores como um “robô ágil que manuseia objetos, sobe degraus, e funciona em escritórios, casas e em espaços abertos”. O site da empresa mostra um <a href=\"https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot-mini\">vídeo</a> em que o SpotMini aparece caminhando, fazendo tarefas domésticas e se recompondo depois de uma queda. Ao contrário do seu gêmeo malvado em “Metalhead”, o robô nos vídeos promocionais parece prestativo e até amigável.</p>\n<p>Seria bom imaginar um futuro em que robôs como o SpotMini sejam usados para nos ajudar nas tarefas domésticas, não para perseguir e matar seres humanos aterrorizados em fuga. Só é possível evitar o futuro distópico mostrado em programas como “Black Mirror” exigindo supervisão pública sobre as empresas do Vale do Silício, cujas políticas ditam a forma futura de nossas sociedades e também de nossas próprias vidas.</p>\n<p>Foto do título: Maxine Peake, no papel da personagem Bella, no episódio “Metalhead” da nova temporada de “Black Mirror”.</p>\n<p><em>Tradução: Deborah Leão.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/08/black-mirror-expoe-nosso-medo-de-robos-e-algoritmos-que-fogem-do-controle/\">“Black Mirror” expõe nosso medo de robôs e algoritmos que fogem do controle</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>America’s jails and</u> prisons have long since banned and censored books that the institutions determined posed a material danger to the safety of inmates and employees. There is a logic, at least, to prohibiting how-to manuals on crafting homemade weapons or escaping confined spaces. But at least two prisons in New Jersey have gone a step further, deciding to ban Michelle Alexander’s groundbreaking work on the rise of mass incarceration in America, “<a href=\"http://newjimcrow.com/\">The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness</a>,” according to a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey to the state’s Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p>The ACLU of New Jersey initially received multiple complaints from incarcerated individuals and their family members concerning the book’s ban. The civil liberties group then filed an Open Public Records Act request, the response to which, according to the letter, “indicated that New Jersey State Prison and Southern State Correctional Facility banned the book as a matter of policy.”</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/home_book_cvr-1515369716.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/home_book_cvr-1515369716-204x300.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-165005\"></a></p>\n<p>“The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” by Michelle Alexander.</p>\n</div>The ACLU of New Jersey said the ban violated the Constitution.\n<p>“The ban on ‘The New Jim Crow’ violates the right to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the correlative protection of Article 1, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution,” ACLU attorneys Tess Borden and Alexander Shalom wrote to Gary Lanigan, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p>The ban also points to some blood-boiling ironies.</p>\n<p>“Michelle Alexander’s book chronicles how people of color are not just locked in, but locked out of civic life, and New Jersey has exiled them even further by banning this text specifically for them,” said ACLU-NJ Executive Director Amol Sinha in a statement. “The ratios and percentages of mass incarceration play out in terms of human lives. Keeping a book that examines a national tragedy out of the hands of the people mired within it adds insult to injury.”</p>\n<p>The ACLU shared a copy of the Department of Corrections’ response to its public records request, which we are publishing exclusively here. The lists of banned publications go on and on — various books and magazines — and two prisons explicitly include “The New Jim Crow.”</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2018/01/08/new-jersey-department-of-corrections-response-to-aclu-of-new-jerseys-public-records-request/\"></div>\n\n<p><u>If you know</u> even a little bit about the prison system in New Jersey, this ban is not even mildly surprising. In spite of reducing its overall prison population, New Jersey continues to lead the nation in the racial disparity between black and white inmates. While the disparity nationwide remains large, with African-Americans having a national average of a 5 to 1 incarceration rate to that of whites, in New Jersey <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/06/nj_has_12_times_more_black_prisoners_than_white_on.html\">the rate was more than double the national average</a>, ballooning up to an outrageous 12 to 1 ratio. What that effectively means is that African-Americans make up less than 15 percent of New Jersey’s overall population, but represent a staggering 60 percent of the state’s prisoners.</p>\n<p>These types of disparities don’t happen by accident; it didn’t happen as an afterthought. The disproportionality can’t be simply chalked up to poverty. And that’s exactly what Michelle Alexander sets out to explain in “The New Jim Crow.” African-Americans dominate America’s jails and prisons because a deliberate set of complex policies and practices. Often disguised as the war on drugs or even the war on poverty, these policies and practices are actually a war on black people. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/?utm_term=.e4f43470d335\">studies show</a> that more white people, by both the overall rate and total numbers, sell drugs than African-Americans, but African-Americans are exponentially more likely to be arrested and sentenced for it.</p>\n<p>The New Jersey Department of Corrections, New Jersey State Prison, and Southern State Correctional Facility did not return requests for comment by press time.</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2018/01/08/aclu-of-new-jersey-letter-on-banning-of-the-new-jim-crow-in-prisons/\"></div>\n\n<p>In their memo, the ACLU attorneys break down the unconstitutional nature of the ban very clearly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In addressing prisoners’ First Amendment rights, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly clarified that “‘[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,’ nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the ‘inside.'” Because “The New Jim Crow” addresses corrections policy and other social and political issues of public concern, it “occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values and is entitled to special protection.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The banning of a particular book such as ‘The New Jim Crow’ — as compared, for example, to a ban on hardcovers — represents content-based censorship on publications,” the ACLU attorneys wrote. “Such censorship is lawful only upon a showing that the prohibition is ‘reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.’ Moreover, ‘a regulation cannot be sustained where the logical connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational,’ or is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns in light of available alternatives. The DOC cannot show that the policy to ban ‘The New Jim Crow’ is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.”</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“The banning of a particular book such as ‘The New Jim Crow’ — as compared, for example, to a ban on hardcovers — represents content-based censorship on publications.”</blockquote>\n<p>The lawyers pointed out that the ban may also violate state regulations enshrined in the New Jersey Administrative Code. They pointed out that books with information on drugs can be banned, according to the code, but only when that information “‘is detrimental to the secure and orderly operation’ of the prison. That cannot apply to a general discussion or critique of the War on Drugs.” The ACLU attorneys went on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Unless the DOC wishes to pretend it can only maintain security and order by depriving prisoners of educational, political, and historical information related to their very situation of incarceration, it cannot be said that this information harms the security or orderly operation of prisons. While “The New Jim Crow” is certainly disturbing and thought-provoking, it is so because of the shocking truth it reveals – the truth New Jersey’s 12-to-1 racial disparity proves – not because it in any way incites violence, disorder, or similar behavior.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On January 16, New Jersey will inaugurate a Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, and its first African-American lieutenant governor, Sheila Oliver. Both campaigned on the promise that they would address and improve these very problems. The Department of Corrections could give them both a head-start by removing this outrageous ban on “The New Jim Crow.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Guard towers loom over the wall of New Jersey State Prison on Dec. 23, 2005 in Trenton, N.J.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/08/new-jim-crow-ban-prisons-nj-new-jersey-aclu/\">ACLU Says New Jersey Prisons’ Banning of “The New Jim Crow” Is Unconstitutional</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>When a group</u> of workers at a Dollar General store in Auxvasse, Missouri, <a href=\"https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/workers-at-auxvasse-dollar-general-vote-to-unionize/article_ca2cb5a8-dd2f-11e7-8326-b37e27e893c8.html\">voted to unionize</a> in early December, employees at nearby stores wanted to know whether the move would affect them. Margeorie Nation, the manager at a Dollar General in Glasgow, another Missouri town, raised her concerns in a conversation with other store managers. She also posted about it on a private social media account.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, she lost her job.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never been written up. I’ve never been reprimanded. Nothing,” Nation told The Intercept. In fact, she said, her store was given a company award for sales and customer satisfaction last year.</p>\n<p>The discount store chain’s employee <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/293508174/Dollar-General-Employee-Handbook\">handbook</a> makes clear the company’s philosophy of remaining union-free. “Our union free status is one reason we continue to grow and provide employment while many unionized companies have declined,” it states.</p>\n<p>Missouri lies at the heart of a national debate about unionizing. This year, it became the 28th state to enact a right-to-work law that says workers cannot be forced to join a union as a condition of employment. Ten days before the law was to come into force, labor unions, which oppose the law, <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/unions-move-to-block-right-to-work-law-in-missouri/article_d7fb08a4-2417-508c-a81d-ab3f0e361971.html\">gathered 300,000 signatures</a> to put the issue directly to voters in the 2018 election.</p>\n<p>Dollar General is a hallmark of the low-wage economy, as its low-cost goods often provide a lifeline to communities that can’t afford to shop at big retailers. But along with low-cost goods often come low wages for employees. As HuffPost’s Dave Jamieson <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/29/dollar-stores-work_n_3786781.html\">reported</a> in 2013, various dollar store chains like Dollar General have worked hard to keep employee compensation low through tactics like classifying certain employees as managers to avoid paying them overtime.</p>\n<p>When the workers in Auxvasse voted 2-to-1 to unionize, their store became the first Dollar General in the country to take that step. They did it with the help of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 655. The local, based in a suburb of St. Louis, typically organizes grocery store workers and other retailers. Around 90 percent of its members in the area work at three major grocery chains, but it also has members in businesses ranging from barbers to a local funeral home. It is the largest private-sector union local in the state.</p>\n<p>Collin Reischman, a spokesperson for the union, told The Intercept that just about two months passed between when the workers reached out to the local and when they voted to unionize. One issue the workers were concerned with, he said, was managers exhibiting favoritism when assigning workers’ schedules.</p>\n<p>“In a job like this, the key to being able to work enough to support yourself is really getting enough hours, you know, and also getting the right hours so you’re also able to see your family once in a while,” Reischmann explained. “There’s always some degree of favoritism in the workplace, right? Our concern is always the unfair favoritism. If you’re the best worker who does the best job, you should get the best hours, that’s just fairness. … That’s one of the things we can do for you is make sure that managers can’t just pick winners and losers, they have to have a system [for determining hours].”</p>\n<p>Nation, however, was not trying to organize a union when the company abruptly fired her in mid-December.</p>\n<p>She was on a regularly scheduled conference call with other store managers in her district on December 9. She decided to ask about the union at the Auxvasse store. “I had employees asking me, as well as other store managers asking questions, ‘How does this affect us?’ If they’re getting better pay or better hours or whatever, how does that affect us? If they unionize and get this, why don’t we?” she told The Intercept. The higher-ups reiterated the company’s longstanding opposition to unionization.</p>\n<p>“I was told to contact my district manager,” she said.</p>\n<p>She texted her district manager and was told that the regional director would be calling her later that day. On December 11, two regional managers visited her store unannounced.</p>\n<p>“No notice that they were coming. No nothing. I was on a register, I was by myself, I was checking out customers,” Nation said. “They came in the store, they never introduced themselves or nothing. They walked around the store and then came around to where I was at while I was checking out customers and basically asked, ‘Why were your employees asking these questions?’”</p>\n<p>The next day, she was browsing the Facebook page “Dollar General Mayhem,” which often posts links critical of the company. She shared <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1929606780634118&id=1449479765313491\">one of its posts</a> on that day linking to a <a href=\"http://www.komu.com/news/auxvasse-location-becomes-first-dollar-general-in-country-to-unionize\">local news story</a> about the Auxvasse union. She added a comment asking her family members what they thought.</p>\n<p>One day later, the regional director and a human resources employee from Dollar General arrived at her store and told her she was terminated for violating company social media policy. According to the employee handbook, Dollar General staff are prohibited from acting as official representatives of the company or sharing information that is “confidential or proprietary to Dollar General.”</p>\n<p>Nation said she had asked for specifics and was not given an answer. Later, after texting with her regional manager, she was told she had shared “confidential company information,” but was never told exactly what that information was.</p>\n<p>The Intercept called the regional manager and emailed Dollar General multiple times seeking comment; the company did not respond to a detailed list of questions.</p>\n<p>Not only does Nation not know how exactly she violated company policy, but she’s also confused about how her employer knew that she shared an article about the Auxvasse store’s unionizing; Her Facebook page is set to private.</p>\n<p>Dollar General stands to benefit from rising inequality in America, as CEO Todd Vasos noted at a Goldman Sachs retailing conference in September. “As middle class continues to go away, unfortunately, to the lower end of the economic scale versus the higher end,” he said, the economy will create more of the chain’s “core customer.”</p>\n<p>“I think there’s going to be more and more opportunities for us to get in and build more stores,” Vasos added.</p>\n<p>In an early December earnings call, Vasos was asked about how the company’s core customer would be impacted by minimum wage increases in some states. “We feel good about where the consumer is right now,” <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4130471-dollar-generals-dg-ceo-todd-vasos-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=9\">he said</a>. “But as I always say, we work under the premise that she is always tight because her expenses continue to rise on the other side of expense — excuse me, of her income rising.”</p>\n<p>Dollar General in December <a href=\"http://www.fultonsun.com/news/local/story/2017/dec/17/dollar-general-requests-union-vote-recount/704687/\">asked</a> for a recount of the Auxvasse union vote, claiming that two of the four employees who voted in favor said they had changed their minds. On January 3, the National Labor Relations Board held a hearing on the matter, but it has not yet decided whether it will grant a new vote.</p>\n<p>For her part, Nation has hired a lawyer and plans to challenge her termination.</p>\n<p>Top photo: A screenshot from Google Maps of the Dollar General in Auxvasse, Mo., the first Dollar General in the country to successfully vote to unionize.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/08/dollar-general-unionize-missouri-manager-fired/\">A Missouri Dollar General Voted to Unionize — Then a Manager at Another Store Asked About It and Was Fired</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>There’s no real</u> plot in the “Metalhead” episode in the new season of “Black Mirror.” The star of the episode is a small, uncommunicative black robot that walks on all fours and is armed with a pistol stored in its front leg. Who controls the robot, if anyone, is never divulged. The four-legged mechanical creature operates seemingly on its own and for its own purposes. Over the course of the 40-minute episode, it hunts down a woman desperately fleeing through a forest, as she tries in vain to evade its sensors.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with the show, “Black Mirror” is a science fiction series on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/70264888\">Netflix</a> about a near-future in which new technologies reap terrible unintended consequences on our lives; they strip away personal independence, undermining our societal values and sometimes letting loose uncontrollable violence. As terrifying as they are, the technologies depicted in the show are not outlandish. Like the autonomous robot in “Metalhead,” they reflect easily conceivable, near-term advances upon currently existing technologies, such as drones.</p>\n<p>Since the first detonations of atomic bombs in the 20th century, pop culture has been morbidly fascinated by the realization that humanity has developed tools powerful enough to destroy itself. But the malign technologies depicted in “Black Mirror” are more subtle than nuclear weapons. Most of the show’s episodes deal with advances in robotics, surveillance, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence – fields that happen to be key areas for tech companies in the real world. The creators of the series demonstrate how, left unchecked, the internal logic of these new technologies can bring about the destruction of their owners.</p>\n<p>“Black Mirror’s” slick production values and acting have won wide critical acclaim. But its social commentary also seems to have struck a nerve with a public that has begun evincing confusion, fear, and alienation over the consequences of new consumer technologies. A 2015 <a href=\"https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2015/10/13/americas-top-fears-2015/\">study</a> by Chapman University found that three out of five of the top fears Americans have were related to the consequences of emerging technologies. The potential of automation to wipe out millions of U.S. jobs and artificial intelligence’s potential to undermine democracy have been well-documented. But the phenomena of livestreamed murders, online terrorist recruitment, and social media threats of nuclear apocalypse have helped create an environment of increasing pessimism.</p>\n<p>It’s worth reflecting on how we got to this point.</p>\n<p>In 1992, before the spread of the internet, American cultural critic Neil Postman wrote a short book, titled “Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology.” Postman argued that our modern idea of technology was becoming dangerously warped. Instead of developing new technologies to achieve acknowledged public goals, we had begun to take technological advance as an end unto itself. Without a strong cultural and political context to determine what should be invented and why, we risked undermining both our civic culture and our democracy in the face of powerful new technologies that operated according to their own logic. Rather than creating inventions to fulfill our needs, Postman warned that we might soon begin adapting ourselves to meet the needs of our inventions.</p>\n<p>“Black Mirror” depicts a nightmare version of Postman’s prediction. Technologies like virtual reality and social network rankings – blindly adopted in the belief that they will make life better – gradually become vehicles for authoritarian social control, and even the enslavement of their owners. The show reflects a growing trend in popular culture. In recent years, other science fiction series like “Westworld” and “H+” have also focused on the dark side of emerging technologies, including robotics and artificial intelligence. In his recent book, “Why Liberalism Failed,” Notre Dame political science professor Patrick Deneen made this suggestion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most examples of this recent genre seem to reflect a widespread foreboding about a shared sense of powerlessness, and even the potential for a new kind of bondage to the very technology that is supposed to liberate us. These movies and programs portray how, in our optimistic and even hubristic belief that our technology will usher in a new age of freedom, we discover in various ways that we are subjects to those very technologies. Far from controlling our technology for our own betterment, we find that the technology ends up either ruling or destroying us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The powerlessness many people feel in the face of new technologies may have something to do with the undemocratic nature of their development. People naturally fear what they depend on but have no understanding or control over. In the last 10 to 15 years, many long-held social and political norms have been washed away by technologies that have helped contribute to a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/\">crisis of faith</a> in American democracy. Silicon Valley companies have been remarkably opaque about the future implications of their research and development programs, which, among other things, many Americans plausibly believe <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/210728/one-four-workers-say-technology-eliminate-job.aspx\">will lead to the loss of their jobs.</a></p>\n<p>When major tech executives do speak up, they often make disturbing statements about the looming death of cherished public norms like personal privacy. In a 2010 interview, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that “the days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly,” declaring further that “having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.”</p>\n<p>Even if the most dire <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-warning-destroy-civilization-703630\">warnings</a> about rogue artificial intelligence programs destroying humanity never come to pass, we have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">sacrificed much of our personal autonomy</a> to technologies whose underlying philosophies were unclear when they were introduced to the public. There is a growing backlash to this kind of corporate authoritarianism. Calls to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-20/should-america-s-tech-giants-be-broken-up\">break up tech companies</a> under federal antitrust laws are increasing, while disillusioned former Silicon Valley executives have become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/facebook-former-executive-ripping-society-apart\">increasingly vocal</a> about the negative social side effects of the programs they helped develop. Technological utopianism is slowly giving way to an acknowledgement that technologies aren’t value-neutral, and it’s the role of a functioning society to govern how they are utilized.</p>\n<p>The robot in the “Metalhead” episode of “Black Mirror” was inspired by an actual robot developed by the engineering firm Boston Dynamics. Named the SpotMini, the device is described by its creators as a “nimble robot that handles objects, climbs stairs, and will operate in offices, homes and outdoors.” A <a href=\"https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot-mini\">video</a> of the SpotMini walking around, doing household tasks and righting itself after a fall is posted on the company website. Unlike its evil twin in “Metalhead,” the robot in Boston Dynamics’s promotional videos seems helpful, even friendly.</p>\n<p>It’d be nice to imagine a future in which robots like the SpotMini are used to help us around the house, rather than hunt down and kill our fellow humans as they flee in terror. If the nightmare future depicted in shows like “Black Mirror” can be avoided, it will only come by asserting public oversight of the Silicon Valley companies whose policies are dictating the future shape of our societies — as well as our personal lives.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Maxine Peake playing the character Bella in the “Metalhead” episode of the new season of “Black Mirror.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/07/black-mirror-season-4-netflix-metalhead/\">“Black Mirror” Reveals Our Fear of Robots and Algorithms We Can’t Control</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>A court convened</u> Wednesday afternoon to hear the case of students at Fordham University who are suing the school, which had denied them the ability to form an official student club in December 2016. The petitioning students, Ahmad Awad, Sofia Dadap, Sapphira Lurie, and Julie Norris, who are represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights and Palestine Legal, had tried to form a club on one of the most contentious political issues on campus: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>The fight over forming a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter had dragged on for more than two years. Students had applied to establish SJP at the Lincoln Center Campus in November 2015, but administrators had resisted from the beginning. The students were asking the court to uphold Fordham’s own policies and mission, and to reinstate the United Student Government’s vote in support of establishing the chapter.</p>\n<p>Awad, a Palestinian-American, believes that the school’s rejection of SJP sets a dangerous precedent.</p>\n<p>“SJP was going to allow a different perspective on campus,” said Awad, now a law student at Rutgers University. “Allowing SJP [would] allow Fordham to continue a standard of free speech and uphold its mission statement” — alluding to a passage in the school’s mission about “the alleviation of poverty, the promotion of justice, the protection of human rights.”</p>\n<p>Much of the debate around admitting the club has focused on SJP’s support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, a nonviolent global campaign to pressure Israel to end its abuses of Palestinians’ rights, which has been met with controversy by Israeli political leaders and pro-Israel figures in the U.S. The fight over BDS has become a national one; state-level legislative bodies, Congress, civil rights groups, and, of course, pro-Israel advocacy groups are all heavily involved. But in no place does the fight seem to be as heated as on college campuses.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the court broke without rendering a judgment, and it’s unclear when one will come. The case continues to loom as another data point in the campaign to suppress Palestine activism on campus — a campaign with successes that dispirit and confound observers who favor open debates and Palestinian rights.</p>\n<p>“College campuses are where people are supposed to be exposed to new ideas,” said Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian-American professor and co-director of the Center for Palestine Studies at Columbia University. “There is absolutely no reason why the policies of a country that is engaged in the longest occupation in modern history, which is entirely dependent on the support of the United States, should not be discussed openly and critically in the United States.”</p>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/07/palestine-israel-fordham-sjp-lawsuit-bds/#_ftnref1\"></a></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Fordham-sjp-trial-08-1515091937.jpg\"><img alt=\"Fordham University students, Sofia Dadap, Ahmad Awad, and Julie Norris outside the Manhattan Civil Courthouse in New York City, on Jan. 3, 2018.

(I was involved with SJP’s Rutgers University chapter while attending school there.)</p>\n<p>During one of those meetings, the students were asked about their thoughts on <a href=\"http://bdsmovement.net/\">BDS</a> and if it called for the dissolution of Israel. They were queried about why they use the term “apartheid.” And administrators prodded them on whether they were supportive of or open to working with Jewish groups. In a move that <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/07/anti-semitism-jewish-voice-for-peace-panel/\">dangerously</a> and falsely conflates criticisms of Israel with anti-Semitism, Fordham University administrators called on the Jewish Student Organization to weigh in on granting SJP club status. Students were also asked to seek a vote of approval from the United Student Government, even though the requirement was not clearly university policy at the time: Students organizing the SJP club were working from a packet which did not list the requirement, and were later furnished with a revised packet that required the vote and gave the dean of students veto power. The student government nonetheless voted that the club should be admitted.</p>\n<p>Yet the school rejected the application. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict “is a topic that often leads to polarization rather than dialogue. The purpose of the organization as stated in the proposed club constitution points toward that polarization,” <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/EldredgetoSJP_12-22-16_Decision_Redacted.pdf\">wrote</a> Keith Eldredge, the dean of students at Fordham’s Lincoln Center Campus, in a letter to the students in December 2016. “Specifically, the call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions of Israel presents a barrier to open dialogue and mutual understanding and learning.” It was the first time that Fordham denied a student club application that had been approved by the student government, according to Palestine Legal, and no recourse was given to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s hearing, Fordham’s lawyers stated that because the university is a private entity, the First Amendment doesn’t apply, and students’ free speech can be arbitrarily restricted.</p>\n<p>“The question is who defines whether certain speech has crossed the line of racist incitement or not,” said Omar Barghouti, a Palestine-based activist who co-founded the BDS movement, in an interview. “This is not about feeling ‘uncomfortable’ about speech that you despise or viscerally disagree with.” Barghouti went on to say that the opposition to the club “devalues the lives of oppressed and marginalized groups that already suffer institutional racism and discrimination in the current hegemonic culture, thus exposing them to palpable physical harm and further intimidation.”</p>\n<p>Khalidi, the Columbia professor, said that Fordham’s actions are an “egregious violation of free speech and academic freedom.”</p>\n<p>“This constitutes an unwarranted interference by the university in student life,” Khalidi said. “There’s an overwhelming political and media consensus in support of Israel in the United States. People who would like to put forward a critical point of view on college campuses should be allowed to do so.”</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Divest-um-bds-1515192709.jpg\"><img alt=\"University of Michigan students participate in a sit in to divest from companies that have supported human rights violations against Palestinians on March 20, 2014.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Divest-um-bds-1515192709-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164949\"></a>\n<p>University of Michigan students, Tahany Alsabahi, center, and Sumeyye Korkaya, right, participate in a sit-in to divest from companies that have supported human rights violations against Palestinians, on March 20, 2014.</p>\n<p>Photo: Virginia Lozano</p></div>\n<p><u>The flaps over</u> campus advocacy for Palestinian rights frequently stem from the <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\">BDS</a> movement, which was modeled on grassroots opposition to the South African apartheid. Despite its nonviolent foundation, BDS has been met with a torrent of activism that has led 23 states to enact anti-BDS legislation, including New York. Many of the state-level laws, critics say, risk chilling dissent even if they don’t criminalize it. In some cases, however, civil liberties groups have raised stronger objections. Last summer, the American Civil Liberties Union <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/how-israel-anti-boycott-act-threatens-first-amendment-rights\">opposed </a>a bill introduced in both houses of Congress for potentially criminalizing a boycott activity against Israel. Later in 2017, the group <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/right-boycott-under-threat\">filed a lawsuit</a> against Kansas over an anti-BDS law it said also violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Those same fights have played out on college campuses large and small, public and private alike. The controversies often emerge around Students for Justice in Palestine, a national group founded in 2010 that has grown to roughly 200 school chapters.</p>\n<p>Students at the University of Michigan have lobbied their student government 11 times since 2002 to divest from companies that enable Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands. Last November, the student government finally accepted a motion pushing divestment after an approximately seven-hour hearing. Following the vote, however, the school released a <a href=\"https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/resolution-regarding-divestment/\">statement </a>that it was unlikely to heed the student government and would continue investing as normal.</p>\n<p>Last semester at Brooklyn College, professors and students, some of whom had already graduated, found their names listed as “terrorist supporters” on posters around campus. The posters were sponsored by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a far-right group known for its anti-Muslim animus. Of the two professors and nine current and former students who were listed on the posters, many had been active members or supportive of Brooklyn College’s SJP chapter, which has advocated for BDS, among other social justice movements.</p>\n<p>“It is quite transparently an attempt to intimidate faculty and produce a certain kind of chilling effect,” said Samir Chopra, a professor of philosophy at Brooklyn College whose name was also listed on the posters. Chopra, who does not entirely support the BDS movement but believes its advocacy falls within students’ rights to free speech, cited the other forms of intimidation used against students, such as blacklists generated by pro-Israel groups. “Many of these things can be professional death,” Chopra said. “I quite honestly think that if I were to go out looking for a job, I would not find a job right now.”</p>\n<p>Although Brooklyn College’s president condemned the poster campaign, some students recalled that the administration was less than fully supportive. “Every single time we had an event, every time we tried to do anything, there was so much backlash,” said Thomas DeAngelis, a former Brooklyn College student who was listed on the posters despite moving on to the University of Minnesota for graduate school.</p>\n<p>DeAngelis said that administrators regularly required metal detectors and security guards for SJP events. With the exception of certain events held by the Caribbean student clubs, this wasn’t the experience of other student clubs, according to DeAngelis. SJP students at other universities, including DePaul University and the University of New Mexico, echoed DeAngelis’s testimony, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIni_3TYg-A\">saying</a> that administrators often required their SJP chapters to post security guards at events. Brooklyn College doesn’t outright prevent students from organizing, DeAngelis said, but by constantly throwing hurdles at organizers and not protecting them from harassment, Brooklyn College creates an added anxiety for activists, making it impossible for SJP to fully function.</p>\n<p>“They never canceled our events, but they would make us go through crazy loopholes and come up with new rules based on something SJP did — like what type of things are appropriate at events and what material could be distributed,” DeAngelis said. “People got fed up and it pushed a lot of people to do work outside of SJP.”</p>\n<p><strong>Update: Jan. 8, 2018</strong><br>\n<em>This post was updated to clarify that a student government vote was not a written requirement at the time that Fordham students launched their efforts to establish a club. The requirement was added to a subsequent version of an application packet furnished to the students by the school administration.</em></p>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/07/palestine-israel-fordham-sjp-lawsuit-bds/#_ftnref1\"></a></p>\n<p>Top photo: Ahmad Awad, after his hearing against Fordham University at the Manhattan Civil Courthouse in New York City, on Jan. 3, 2018.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/07/palestine-israel-fordham-sjp-lawsuit-bds/\">Students Await Judgment in Suit Over Fordham University Banning of Pro-Palestine Club</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>For quite a</u> while, there has been a bull market in stories about Steve Bannon calling the shots in the incorrigible tangle of neurons that passes for Donald Trump’s brain. Michael Wolff’s new book about the dysfunctional White House, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Fury-Inside-Trump-White/dp/1250158060\">Fire and Fury</a>,” adds a marvelous coda to this narrative, with Bannon, in his waning days in the West Wing, telling the insane truth about the most ridiculous and frightening presidency ever.</p>\n<p>Bannon deserves every bit of attention and disgust that has come his way in recent times. His racism, laundered through Breitbart News and the White House, has fueled the far right and fanned Trump’s enfeebled instincts. Bannon’s hatred of immigration and Muslims is so fierce that he even <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/11/steve-bannons-tall-tale-about-how-he-visited-pakistan-in-the-navy-and-saw-the-muslim-threat/\">concocted a tale</a> about seeing the dangers of Islam firsthand when a Navy vessel he had served aboard in 1979 stopped in Pakistan – except, as it turns out, the vessel did not stop in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>But the attention Bannon demands of us should not obscure the rival media impresario with truly Manchurian levels of influence over the president: Rupert Murdoch. One of the less-noted passages in Wolff’s book <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html\">explains</a> that the president reveres Murdoch, regularly seeking advice from the founder of the Fox empire, a condition that made Bannon jealous of Murdoch’s power over Trump. The book quotes Roger Ailes, who ran Fox News for Murdoch until being dismissed for sexual harassment, as noting that “Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert.”</p>\n<p>Wolff’s book may not be the whole truth, but its account of Trump’s infatuation with Murdoch is consistent with reports <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/donald-trump-white-house.html?_r=0\">elsewhere</a>. Murdoch and Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/14/520080606/murdoch-and-trump-an-alliance-of-mutual-interest\">speak frequently</a> – “Murdoch here,” their phone calls <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/business/media/murdoch-trump-relationship.html\">begin</a>, according to the New York Times, which reports that Trump counts Murdoch “as one of his closest confidants.” The men have known each other for decades, since the days when Murdoch owned the New York Post and Trump was one of its fawning obsessions (“Best Sex I’ve Ever Had,” read a famous Post headline from 1990, referring to an apparent remark from Trump’s then-mistress and future short-term wife, Marla Maples).</p>\n<p>Murdoch’s conservative ideas have never been in the shadows, and his media empire’s embrace of dirty tricks has been evident since it was <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-british-scandal-murdoch-20150611-story.html\">revealed</a> that one of his papers hacked the phones of a murder victim and the relatives of deceased soldiers. But the ethical brutality of the Trump era has seemed to relieve Murdoch of the burden of dressing up his views and morals. Murdoch had delayed his dismissal of Ailes in 2016 (with a $40 million severance package), after which he denied there was a culture of abuse at Fox, despite several male hosts and executives resigning or getting fired for harassing women. “It’s all nonsense,” he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/12/15/rupert-murdoch-downplays-sexual-harassment-allegations-at-fox-news-as-largely-political/\">said</a> last month.</p>\n<p>We don’t know the instructions given to Trump in his “Murdoch here” conversations, but we do know the instructions the president gets from Fox News. There’s a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/05/trump-media-feedback-loop-216248\">cottage industry</a>, in which the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/948189936393564161\">Kremlinologists</a> of social media correlate Trump’s statements and tweets to what he has apparently just watched on Fox and, in particular, his favorite show on the network, Fox &amp; Friends. Of course, it’s distressing that a president spends as much time as Trump does watching television (while eating cheeseburgers in bed, according to Wolff), but the fact that he mimics what he hears on a cable channel that promotes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/943310115133902848\">conspiracy</a> <a href=\"http://feixingren.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/12/18/the-most-popular-fact-checks-of-2017/%3Ewashingtonpost.com%3C/a%3E%20%3C/span%3E%20%3Cspan%20class=?blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/05/24/what-does-it-take-for-sean-hannity-to-abandon-a-conspiracy/?u\">theories</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/846740315721678853?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewrepublic.com%2Fminutes%2F141668%2Ffox-news-making-habit-racist-attacks-maxine-waters\">racists</a> is … oh God, it would be a pleasure to conjure something more absurd and less chilling.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fox News is going to get us all killed.</p>\n<p>Left, Fox, 7:37 pm<br>Right, Trump, 7:49 pm <a href=\"https://t.co/Qewz7I1SRF\">pic.twitter.com/Qewz7I1SRF</a></p>\n<p>— Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/948358498462650369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A day in the life of the president who doesn’t watch much TV primarily because of documents. <a href=\"https://t.co/JMt0inwOGR\">pic.twitter.com/JMt0inwOGR</a></p>\n<p>— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/948416574670688256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fox News is not on autopilot. Its unhinged condition is not a consequence of its anchors and producers deciding, autonomously, that they would like to take the network where no network has gone before. This is Murdoch’s doing. After Ailes left, Murdoch assumed the position of the network’s executive chair and led its swan dive into the far-right gutter. “Rupert Murdoch is in charge,” <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fox-news-roger-ailes-tucker-carlson-1202490160/\">noted</a> Fox anchor Bill Hemmer a year after Ailes’s departure. <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/after-ailes-and-oreilly-fox-news-risky-evolution\">According</a> to the Daily Beast, Murdoch often presides over the morning news meetings; Vanity Fair <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/ailes-gone-megyn-kelly-reborn-shell-shocked-fox-news-looks-like-an-episode-of-the-leftovers\">quotes</a> a former Fox executive as saying Murdoch “is having the time of his life running” the network.</p>\n<p>Fox was never balanced or fair, and Ailes was not a nice guy. But according to Tamara Holder, a lawyer and former Fox contributor, Ailes at least made sure the network didn’t totally lose it. Holder, who <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/17/media/tamara-holder-fox-news-rupert-murdoch/index.html\">left the network</a> at the end of 2016 after accusing a senior executive of sexual misconduct (the executive was fired and Holder received a settlement), views Ailes’s dismissal and death a year later as key factors. According to Holder, Ailes required at least a bit of balance, if only a fig leaf, in the network’s coverage. “The one thing they’re missing is the Roger Ailes control button,” Holder told me. “Roger was good at overseeing things and calling it when he saw it was a little out of control.”</p>\n<p>In the wake of Wolff’s book, there is no shortage of headlines about Bannon’s quotes and their fallout. The wealthy Mercer family, in response to Trump banishing Bannon from his set – er, his presidency – is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/bannon-mercer-trump.html?&moduleDetail=section-news-2&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article\">distancing itself</a> from Bannon’s projects. But Bannon’s malevolent influence on Trump and America is slighter than that of Murdoch and Fox. While the reach of Bannon’s Breitbart News is large in relation to its modest size – it is <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/inside-the-breitbart-embassy-where-bannon-parties-and-plots.html\">headquartered</a> in the basement of a three-story townhouse in Washington, D.C. — Fox News is a globe-spanning entity with more than <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fox-news-channel\">1,000 employees</a> and <a href=\"http://press.foxnews.com/corporate-info/\">90 million subscribers</a>, including a particularly avid one at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. The power behind the throne of the xenophobic right in the United States is not the millionaire banker from Goldman Sachs, but the billionaire immigrant from Australia.</p>\n<p>Top photo: President Donald Trump is embraced in New York City by Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of Fox News, during a dinner to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the World War II Battle of the Coral Sea, on May 4, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/06/rupert-murdoch-trump-fire-and-fury-steve-bannon/\">Enough About Steve Bannon.

        "content": "<p><u>Over the past</u> week, tens of thousands of people in dozens of cities across Iran have braved bullets and tear gas in a public outpouring of dissent against the country’s ruling establishment. Videos of demonstrations shared on social media have shown protesters smashing government-owned banks, tearing down posters of government officials, and at times calling for the end of clerical rule in the country. At least 22 people are reported to have been killed since the unrest began December 28, with human rights groups saying hundreds more were detained by security forces.</p>\n<p>The outbreak and nature of the unrest have taken many analysts of Iranian politics by surprise. Rather than emerging from liberal Tehran, these protests appear to have originated in working-class conservative cities and towns that the Islamic Republic likes to depict as its core constituency. One group of people, however, has long expected such an outbreak of discontent from the economically disadvantaged people in these areas: Iranian labor activists.</p>\n<p>“Working people in Iran have been dreaming of a better life for four decades, but today ordinary people often have to work two or three jobs simply to survive,” says Mehdi Kouhestaninejad, a longtime Iranian trade unionist now living in Canada, who is active in the international solidarity movement for workers’ rights in Iran. “Many people inside and outside Iran may be shocked by what is going on, but trade unionists have been warning for the past 10 years that there will be an uprising against the ruling class and their kleptocracy.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the 2009 Green Movement, which was largely a product of the educated, urban Tehrani middle class, the recent protests in Iran appear to reflect the anger of the country’s working-class masses. As Iranians grapple with high inflation, unemployment, and economic corruption, the burden of these problems has fallen most heavily on young people who lack the political connections to survive, let alone raise their standard of living.</p>\n<p>The latest protests also erupted from an unclear place in terms of Iran’s political spectrum: While the Green Movement was rallying around reformist politics and its leadership in Mir Hossein Mousavi, the latest protests have seen chants cursing just about every actor and political affiliation in Iran. There were frequent changes of “death to Rouhani” — referring to Iran’s reform-minded centrist president, Hassan Rouhani, whom young Tehranis have repeatedly poured into the streets to support.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/iran-protests-1515193229.jpg\"><img alt=\"Photo taken on Dec. 30, 2017, shows unrest on the streets of central Tehran.

But while labor groups have supported the protests, it is unclear to what extent they have been involved in actually directing them. The ability of independent civil society groups to publicly organize in Iran is greatly constrained by the government.</p>\n<p>One of the few videos that has been released clearly articulating economic grievances against the government <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/01/iran-protests-irgc-media-producers-landscape-avant-tv.html\">appears</a> to have been an astroturf operation organized by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a way of turning the unrest against their rivals in the Rouhani government.</p>\n<p>Historically, however, workers’ movements in Iran have been an important center of power in the country. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution, labor organizers helped play a decisive role in the fall of the Pahlavi monarchy, particularly oil workers, whose decision to go on strike in the late days of the revolution brought the country’s economy to a halt and helped seal the fate of Mohammad Reza Shah.</p>\n<p>Following the revolution, the new clerical rulers of the Islamic Republic quickly moved to marginalize labor groups. Today, the formation of independent trade unions is effectively banned in Iran, while labor rights activists are routinely detained and imprisoned by security forces. Workers today are allowed to organize government-approved Islamic Labor Councils, but the bodies are widely viewed as being coopted by the state and unable to effect genuine change.</p>\n<p>The absence of genuine labor movements and the bargaining power that they provide has helped foster an <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/iran-rouhani-economic-inequality-rising.html\">increasingly unequal society</a>. Although the Iranian economy is widely believed to have turned a corner following the lifting of international sanctions related to the country’s nuclear program, the resulting benefits have been <a href=\"http://www.mei.edu/content/article/rouhani-s-neoliberal-doctrine-has-failed-iran\">unevenly distributed</a>. For young, working-class people dealing with rampant inflation, unemployment, and income inequality, there is a growing sense of hopelessness about the future. The increasing militarization of Iranian society and takeover of components of the economy by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps — an institution close to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and other influential clerical bodies — have also created what the exiled labor activist Kouhestaninejad describes as a “mafia-like” atmosphere, in which the ability of working-class people to assert their rights has been tightly constrained.</p>\n<p>“There is no transparency. We are dealing with a government in which no one knows who is who and every part of the economy is seemingly under the influence of the IRGC, which is running it like a mafia,” Kouhestaninejad says. “Meanwhile, there are millions of youths who cannot find a job, or when they find a job it is precarious and they have no job security. Oftentimes to work, they must sign a ‘white contract,’ which means that their employer can assign them any terms they want, with no negotiation.”</p>\n<p>While the recent protests have garnered considerable international attention, labor activists and workers in Iran have been engaged in long-running battles over unpaid wages and benefits that predate the latest unrest.</p>\n<p>In December, hundreds of workers at the Haft Tapeh sugar cane plantation in Shush, a city in southwestern Iran, launched a round of strikes and protests over unpaid wages that, by then, were more than four months late. While working-class demonstrators often lack the media savvy, language skills, and international connections available to Tehran-centric political opposition movements, workers at Haft Tapeh managed to get international attention for their fight through their affiliation with the International Union of Food and Allied Workers, a global trade union federation also known as IUF.</p>\n<p>IUF representatives say that the recent unrest across the country was long expected and represents the culmination of grievances on the part of ordinary people in the country. “There is no need to speculate on the causes of the regular strikes and demonstrations like those at Haft Tapeh, and no need to search for foreign enemies stirring the pot. The current round of mass demonstrations is an authentic expression of frustration and anger,” says Peter Rossman, a spokesperson for the IUF based in Geneva. “Workers at Haft Tapeh have been compelled to hold strikes and demonstration since 2008 to feed their families. The ferocious repression against workers seeking to form unions explains why the frustration can only express itself in this form.”</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">“The ferocious repression against workers seeking to form unions explains why the frustration can only express itself in this form.”</blockquote>\n<p><u>The recent demonstrations</u> represent the biggest public challenge to the Islamic Republic’s rule since the Green Movement. But it’s unclear what the future trajectory of these protests in Iran will be. Unlike the Green Movement, those who have taken to the streets in recent days have not won the backing of prominent members of the ruling establishment, nor have any identifiable leaders emerged.</p>\n<p>According to the Iranian Interior Ministry, 90 percent of those detained across the country in recent days are under 25 years old – members of a generation that grew up under international sanctions and has little memory of the relative openness of the Islamic Republic under reformist President Mohammad Khatami. The apparent dissatisfaction of these working-class demonstrators stands as a significant challenge to the regime’s authority, given its proclaimed status as a defender of Iran’s conservative masses.</p>\n<p>“Regardless [of] what happens going forward, the protests have proven two things: Areas of [the] country that the regime depicted as their base — small-town, conservative communities — are in fact very angry and very anti-regime,” says Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran. “There is a lot of anger among young people who are children of the working class and went to university, but still find themselves unable to rise in Iranian society.”</p>\n<p>In recent days, officials from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps have announced plans to take control of the security situation in the country. As waves of demonstrations and arrests continue, the future of the protest movement may depend on whether a broader coalition forms that is capable of withstanding the coercive apparatus of the state.</p>\n<p>To some degree, the economically based nature of the protests could potentially militate in the government’s favor by dividing the urban political opposition from the working-class conservative regions currently taking part in the unrest.</p>\n<p>“None of the Green Movement supporters — who are mostly from the educated middle class — have come out in support of the protests, because they see more of a future in Rouhani’s policies than any other alternative, even if they are unhappy with the regime,” says Ghaemi. “The protests have a clear class dimension. They are coming from a segment of young people who feel they have nothing left to lose.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: An Iranian protester is shot by police during demonstrations protesting high prices and the poor state of the economy under President Hassan Rouhani, in Dorud in Lorestan Province, Iran, on Dec. 30, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/06/iran-protests-working-class-rouhani/\">Protests in Iran Took Many By Surprise — But Not Iranian Labor Activists</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

A Força Nacional foi acionada e atualmente está presente em <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/rn/rio-grande-do-norte/noticia/forca-nacional-passa-a-atuar-em-quatro-cidades-do-rn.ghtml\" target=\"_blank\">quatro cidades</a> da Grande Natal.

A situação dos servidores sem salário não parece ser o centro da situação, tanto, que foi pedida a prisão de policiais que incentivem a paralisação, em vez de determinar o pagamento dos atrasados e a regularização das condições de trabalho.</p>\n<p>Um cabo que não pode ser identificado e está há 16 anos na PM do Rio Grande do Norte escreveu um relato a The Intercept Brasil sobre seu atual momento na corporação. Mesmo quase se formando no curso de sargento, ele está arrependido de um dia ter escolhido vestir farda. “Hoje eu sei que falhei com minha família por escolher escolher ser policial e não poder sustentá-la”. Leia o relato do agente sobre seu atual momento na corporação:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Quando prestei concurso para a PM há quase 20 anos, jamais imaginaria que eu e meus colegas iríamos passar o que estamos vivenciando agora.</p>\n<p>Estou com o salário de dezembro e o décimo terceiro em atraso, alguns que ganham um pouco mais estão também com o de novembro em atraso. Atrasos que já vêm se prolongando há cerca de 23 meses. Sempre fui um cara altamente controlado com dinheiro, o pouco que ganho como policial militar sempre deu, na medida do possível, para que eu suprisse as minhas necessidades e as da minha família.</p>\n<p>Com tantos atrasos, eu, que sempre paguei em dia as minhas contas, hoje me encontro devendo o cheque especial, juros em cima de juros dos cartões de crédito, empréstimos e por aí vai. Semana passada, venceu o boleto do consórcio que pago com muito esforço e suor para, um dia, comprar meu automóvel próprio. Todo mundo sabe que andar de ônibus ou qualquer meio de transporte público hoje, sendo policial, é quase a mesma coisa que cometer um suicídio.</p>\n<p>Esses constantes atrasos estão criando um abalo emocional muito grande, me sinto desprezado pelo governo, me sinto impotente frente às situações financeiras que passo porque não me resta mais nada a fazer. Muitas vezes me sinto um lixo.</p>\n<p>Vou confessar algo que me aconteceu há alguns dias e, quando me lembro, meus olhos se enchem de lágrimas.</p>\n<p>Eu tenho um filho que mora em outro estado. Ano passado, eu fiz uma promessa a ele: disse que o traria no final de 2017 para passar os meses de férias comigo. Agora, em janeiro, já faz três anos que não o vejo a não ser por fotos ou ligações. Meu filho já é um adolescente, sinto que precisa do pai junto para um conselho, uma conversa. Essa semana, por causa da falta de pagamento do meu salário, tive que ligar para o meu filho e tentar explicar que iria quebrar a promessa que tinha feito a ele porque não tinha dinheiro nem para me alimentar, quanto mais para custear sua vinda para minha casa.</p>\n<p>Durante a conversa, pude sentir seu tom de voz mudar. Percebi o quanto ele ficou decepcionado comigo como pai. Na hora, me bateu uma dor tão grande que eu me arrependi de abraçar a carreira de policial. Até fiz um pequeno texto e enviei para uns amigos, mais ou menos assim: ‘Hoje eu sei que falhei com minha família por escolher ser policial e não poder sustentá-la.’</p>\n<p>Eu disse essas palavras com tanta dor no coração! Em quase 20 anos de dedicação à sociedade, foi a primeira vez na vida que eu me arrependi de ser policial. Será que dá pra imaginar o quanto isso dói? Não sei, mas eu sei o quanto isso está me custando psicologicamente.</p>\n<p>Em outros países, os policiais são vistos como heróis. Aqui, infelizmente, somos mal vistos. Alguns têm até nojo e desprezo pela gente.</p>\n<p>Recentemente, depois de quase 20 anos de serviços prestados à PMRN [Polícia Militar do Rio Grande do Norte], fui convocado para fazer o curso de sargentos, que pode dar uma qualidade de vida melhor para mim e minha família. Esse curso era para ser comemorado, ser motivo de festa e de muitas alegrias, mas na hora que caiu a ficha, me bateu um desespero, me vieram as perguntas: como é que eu vou chegar ao local do curso se eu não tenho o dinheiro da passagem? Como é que eu vou frequentar o curso, se há três ou quatro anos eu não recebo fardamento, coturno(bota), cobertura(boné), não tenho como me alimentar durante o curso ou qualquer equipamentos para desenvolver minha atividade?</p>\n<p>A turma do curso, que era para estar cheia de policiais alegres com as futuras ascensões, é composta por homens e mulheres cabisbaixos, com pouquíssimas palavras ditas, pessoas com a cabeça não se sabe onde.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">Como pode um policial sair para trabalhar de barriga vazia, meu Deus? Onde vamos parar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Esses comportamentos, que tanto eu quanto toda a tropa estamos tendo, já deixaram os oficiais preocupados. Eles já perceberam que eu e outros mais já estamos depressivos com tantos problemas que estamos carregando sem termos culpa, já alertaram os instrutores e monitores para que informem se notarem algum comportamento ou atitude estranha.</p>\n<p>Ontem mesmo, um colega tentou se matar após a esposa ligar para ele chorando e dizendo que estava com fome. Eu fico me perguntando como podemos sair de nossas casas para combater o crime se não temos armas adequadas, munições suficientes, coletes (muitos, por sinal, estão vencidos), viaturas sem a menor condição de rodar, farda, e o mais importante, os nossos salários. Se eu fosse explicar, daria um livro.</p>\n<p>Eu ouço, todos os dias, amigos e colegas dizendo ‘eu estou passando fome’. Como pode um policial sair para trabalhar de barriga vazia, meu Deus?

        "content": "<p><u>Five months after</u> the deadliest human smuggling tragedy in more than a decade unfolded in his city, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus did something unusual: He opted to retain local control over a similar investigation, rather than hand the case off to his federal counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In the process, the police chief released a dozen immigrants found in a tractor trailer from government custody and opened himself up to criticism from proponents of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda.</p>\n<p>According to a police report shared with The Intercept and <a href=\"http://foxsanantonio.com/news/local/homeland-security-officials-accuse-police-chief-mcmanus-of-interfering-with-their-jobs\">comments</a> McManus made to reporters Thursday, the story began on December 23, when an SAPD officer responded to a call regarding a suspicious 18-wheeler parked with its trailer door open. A man who identified himself as the owner of the truck was pacing around the vehicle, the responding officer reported. Inside the trailer, along both sides, were a dozen people — 10 men and two women. When the officer asked one of the men where he was from, the man responded, “Guatemala.”</p>\n<p>By the time McManus arrived, the 12 individuals, suspected of being undocumented immigrants, were seated on a curb. Consistent with past investigations, special agents with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations wing had already been notified. McManus said Thursday that he was at the scene “for probably a good hour and a half” before he made a highly uncommon call: Breaking with tradition, his department would handle the case on its own, pursuing it as a state-level smuggling investigation.</p>\n<p>The driver, Herbert Alan Nichols, was arrested. Under questioning at police headquarters, the 58-year-old reportedly admitted to picking up the migrants at a warehouse in the border city of Laredo. Under the state smuggling charge, he could serve as many as 20 years in prison. Following interviews with detectives, the men and women found in the trailer, ranging from ages 16 to 41, were released to local organizations working on immigration issues. McManus told the press that his officers did not have the jurisdiction to hold the individuals and enforce immigration laws against them.</p>\n<p>While McManus’s decision to handle the investigation in-house might seem less than noteworthy, layers of context suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p>Veteran law enforcement officials say it’s virtually unheard of to see the San Antonio Police Department turn down ICE’s assistance on a smuggling investigation. “I can’t recall a situation like this, where the state [or] local chose to use a state statute instead of letting us work the case,” Jerry Robinette, a former special agent in charge of HSI in San Antonio, told The Intercept. “Look, if this was a car that was driving to the grocery store with two or three illegal aliens, I could understand this situation, but not a tractor trailer,” he added. Julian Calderas, a former deputy field office director in San Antonio for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, echoed Robinette’s view that turning over smuggling cases from local authorities to federal agents was standard practice. “I don’t think that I ever saw a situation where there was clearly organized smuggling that they didn’t,” Calderas <a href=\"http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Man-arrested-for-smuggling-immigrants-on-East-Side-12471179.php#photo-14787771\">told</a> the San Antonio Express News.</p>\n<p>The state smuggling charge McManus and his department chose to pursue in the case is similarly uncommon, at least in the frequency it has been used. At Thursday’s press conference, San Antonio District Attorney Nico LaHood said it was the first time the charge had been brought to his office since taking the job in 2015. The Express News reported the statute has only led to one conviction in Bexar County, where the truck was found, since it was signed into law in 2011. McManus said his decision to keep the investigation under the SAPD umbrella and pursue the state-level smuggling charge was “situational” and “based on a fairly fluid situation on the scene,” not the result of a change in policy.</p>\n<p>“This is not necessarily the way every case is going to be handled going forward,” he said.</p>\n<p>The San Antonio police chief’s careful description of his decision in December is likely linked to the tumultuous state of immigration enforcement politics playing out in Texas, which, in turn, reflects debates swirling around immigration policies nationwide. By noting that his decision was not part of any change in policy, McManus appeared to be making an effort to avoid any accusations that he was in violation of the controversial, newly passed Texas law, known as SB4, which penalizes public officials who oversee policies that prevent police officers from asking individuals about their immigration status. Although SB4 has been challenged in the courts, this particular provision remains in place. Locally, McManus is already facing pushback for his decision. Mike Helle, president of the union for San Antonio police officers, <a href=\"http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/McManus-Police-did-not-have-jurisdiction-to-12474110.php?utm_campaign=twitter-premium&utm_source=CMS%20Sharing%20Button&utm_medium=social\">told</a> the Express News, “If any one of our guys did this, any one of them, they’d probably be put on administrative duty and terminated from the Police Department.”</p>\n<p>Across the country, and especially in Texas, police chiefs in larger cities have bristled at the Trump administration’s efforts to enlist local police in immigration enforcement — arguing that their officers are not trained to enforce federal law, and that questioning individuals about their immigration statuses erodes important relationships between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. These arguments have not stopped senior Trump administration officials from making the case that there should be consequences for public officials who fail to participate in the federal government’s immigration crackdown. Earlier this week, ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan called for the imprisonment of municipal lawmakers who do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,” Homan said.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/smuggling-deaths-memorial-1515175545.jpg\"><img alt=\"A U.S. flag, flowers, candles, and bottles of water help create a make-shift memorial in the parking lot of a Walmart store near the site where authorities Sunday discovered a tractor-trailer packed with immigrants outside a Walmart, Wednesday, July 26, 2017, in San Antonio.

There, the SAPD had found dozens of migrant men, women, and children clinging to life. They had been traveling for hours in the sweltering heat; the trailer’s cooling system had not been functioning, and they had shared a single hole in the wall to breathe through.\n<p>Ten people lost their lives as a result of the July trip. The driver, James Matthew Bradley, was arrested and initially faced the death penalty. The SAPD quickly handed the investigation over to ICE’s HSI special agents, and the U.S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Texas handled the prosecution. Survivors of the journey were detained as material witnesses, meaning they were held in the same for-profit jail as the driver. The treatment of the witnesses by the Department of Justice and federal investigators became a subject of frustration and, in some cases, outrage from their attorneys.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/01/immigrants-helped-prosecutors-after-escaping-death-in-a-smugglers-truck-now-theyre-being-deported/\">investigation</a> by The Intercept, published in October, the lawyers described how their clients were cooperative throughout the investigative process; how HSI agents explained to them that special visas existed for individuals who cooperate with law enforcement; and how every effort to have them released from custody while their case proceeded was met firm resistance from the DOJ. In the end, the U.S. attorney’s office managed to flip Bradley — the threat of the death penalty was removed, and he faces sentencing this month — and a second alleged co-conspirator was charged in connection with the failed smuggling venture. Despite a certification from McManus’s SAPD asserting that the survivors were victims of crimes who cooperated with law enforcement, making them potentially eligible for specialized visas, the material witnesses were quickly handed over to ICE custody. No warning was provided to their attorneys, and the deportations began almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Asked if the deportation of material witnesses in the July case informed his decision in December, McManus told reporters Thursday that it did not. “I don’t want to point fingers at any other agency,” he added. “We have a very, very, very good working relationship with HSI and intend to continue having a good relationship.” McManus said he met with the head of HSI in San Antonio that morning to discuss protocols for the handling of similar cases, though he would not say what those protocols include.</p>\n<p>McManus did, however, add that his department was abiding by an agreement made with local immigrant rights organizations following the July tragedy to utilize a DOJ grant designed to help local law enforcement support victims in similar circumstances. Immigration advocates are hopeful that the police chief’s decision could mark a turn to a more compassionate, victim-centered approach in such cases. Whether such a shift is actually underway, or if it would survive the ultra-heated climate surrounding immigration enforcement politics, remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>Top photo: San Antonio police officers investigate the scene where eight people were found dead in a tractor-trailer loaded with at least 30 others outside a Walmart store in stifling summer heat, in what police are calling a horrific human trafficking case, July 23, 2017, in San Antonio.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/05/san-antonio-police-immigrant-smuggling-ice/\">Texas Police Chief Hands Over Undocumented Smuggling Victims to Local Organizations, Shunning ICE</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

O especialista explica que, após 20 meses na boca de cena do poder, com Temer na presidência, o partido deve procurar voltar aos fundos do palco, ambiente que a legenda domina como nenhuma outra no país, neste ano eleitoral que se inicia. Ainda segundo ele, Roberto Jefferson (PTB) começou o ano tornando a própria filha ministra do Trabalho e pode encerrá-lo se elegendo a um cargo parlamentar.\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Um dos principais personagens do mensalão, Roberto Jefferson fez da própria filha ministra do Trabalho. O que este fato nos mostra?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> Boa parte da classe política brasileira se comporta como se fosse uma casta. Extremamente privilegiados, vivem descolados da realidade da maioria da sociedade brasileira. Para eles, a política é como um empreendimento ou como se fosse algo de direito da família, que passa de geração para geração.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Surge, agora, a questão se a Cristiane Brasil vai se candidatar e abandonar o governo, ou se o pai vai ser candidato…</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.: </strong>Esse é um comportamento estratégico de Roberto Jefferson. Em um sistema eleitoral proporcional, sobretudo no Brasil, que tem dimensões continentais e um eleitorado muito grande, ele acaba tendo chances de ser eleito.</p>\n<p>Se você tem grana, se lança em um estado grande como São Paulo [pelo qual Roberto Jefferson anunciou que irá se candidatar], e chega a uma parte do eleitorado que não o conhece, tem chances de se eleger. O sistema proporcional dá esse tipo de saída, e é assim que muitos se perpetuam por até mesmo décadas. O [Paulo] Maluf é eleito até hoje, gente. Eles sabem usar o marketing eleitoral.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Uma parcela da população apoiou o afastamento da ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff alegando ser “contra a corrupção”. Em seu lugar, entra um governo que dá poder a Roberto Jefferson, <a href=\"http://epoca.globo.com/tempo/expresso/noticia/2016/03/ministro-do-stf-concede-perdao-de-pena-roberto-jefferson-no-mensalao.html\" target=\"_blank\">condenado e depois perdoado pelo STF</a> pelos crimes de corrupção passiva e lavagem de dinheiro. E agora o senhor comenta que ele ainda tem chances de ser eleito este ano. O que isso diz sobre o Brasil?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> Uma parte do eleitorado deve estar chocada ou até anestesiada.</p>\n<p>A parte da população brasileira que foi às ruas para pedir a retirada de um governo eleito democraticamente, de fato, parou de ir às ruas, porque ela cumpriu o papel que imaginou que ia cumprir, no fundo. Mesmo que isso não ficasse claro à época, por trás de um discurso contra a corrupção, ali você via ódio antipetista. Com todas as críticas que a gente pode e deve fazer ao governo do PT, precisamos admitir que tinha ódio: ódio de classes, que muitas vezes se manifestava em discursos machistas, porque era a primeira vez que tínhamos uma presidenta mulher.</p>\n<p>Outra parte, mais progressista, nunca deixou de ir às ruas. Esse papo de que o povo brasileiro saiu das ruas é mentira, <a href=\"https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2017/12/27/interna_politica,927272/servidores-educacao-manifestacao-pelo-13-salario-greve-2018-bh-mg.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">está tendo manifestação</a> direto. Lógico que não tem o mesmo índice de antes, até porque a conjuntura atropela tudo.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> O próprio Roberto Jefferson não acaba surfando nesse ódio anti-PT que você citou?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> Mas aí não é uma característica só dele. Uma parte do sistema político atraiu para si todo esse discurso antipetista e de suposto combate à corrupção. E, no caso de alguns, foi até patético, porque tinha um <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/27/como-2017-expos-o-telhado-de-vidro-de-politicos-que-votaram-pelo-impeachment-de-dilma/\" target=\"_blank\">componente hipócrita</a> muito forte. Teve quem logo depois fosse pego pelos mesmos <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/11/25/novos-escandalos-de-temer-comprovam-que-o-impeachment-visava-protecao-de-corruptos/\" target=\"_blank\">crimes de corrupção</a>.</p>\n<p>É lógico que temos que criticar isso, mas o Roberto Jefferson é só mais um que aprendeu a surfar na onda antipetista da opinião pública. Até mesmo alguns filiados ao PT tentaram se aproveitar disso, saindo do partido. Existe uma parte da classe política que se aproxima do PT quando ele está em ascensão eleitoral e depois sai de perto quando o partido começa a declinar.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Isso, inclusive, acontece entre partidos de esquerda.</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> E que tipo de esquerda é essa, que se aproxima do PT para se beneficiar eleitoralmente e sai quando o partido começa a declinar? Será que o partido que faz isso não demonstra mais uma posição fisiológica do que ideológica de esquerda?</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Qual partido você acha que se destaca por esse movimento de aproximação e afastamento cíclico em relação ao PT?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> O PDT parece se manter fiel ao PT, o PCdoB parece ter se afastado com a pré-candidatura de Manuela [D’Ávila], parece ser um sinal dessa fisiologia. O PSB parecia ser um partido muito atrelado ao PT por muito tempo, mas em 2014 começa a se afastar com a candidatura de Marina Silva. Esses três são os principais partidos que orbitam historicamente em torno do PT, dos que têm peso eleitoral grande e bancada. Mas é preciso esperar a aproximação das eleições para entender quais vão se manter fiéis ao projeto de governo petista/lulista, de redução da desigualdade a longo prazo, e quais estavam atrelados apenas para se beneficiar de alguma maneira.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Como você interpreta o retorno do nome Sarney às manchetes?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> Este caso torna claro que ele se aposentou, mas não perdeu o poder. Esse peso dele vem aparecendo em diversas entrevistas que fiz recentemente com políticos para minha pesquisa. Ele consegue pautar quem quer e barrar quem ele não quer. Foi <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/politica/blog/andreia-sadi/post/2018/01/03/apos-veto-de-sarney-temer-chama-roberto-jefferson-para-discutir-ministerio-do-trabalho.ghtml\" target=\"_blank\">esse o caso agora</a>, ao indicar alguém do PTB, que nem é seu partido, para um cargo no governo.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> A negação do próprio Sarney sobre essa influência na escolha do nome para o ministério do Trabalho é algo surpreendente?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> O comportamento do Sarney nesse caso se assemelha muito ao comportamento histórico do próprio MDB, de buscar o plano de fundo. Então não surpreende.</p>\n<p>A tendência de 2018 para o MDB é o retorno ao plano de fundo da política brasileira, elegendo uma bancada grande mais uma vez, aquilo que tem sido a tônica das últimas eleições. O partido age de maneira estratégica quando entende que essa é a melhor forma de se beneficiar do presidencialismo de coalizão, e o Sarney demonstra saber disso. O MDB atravessou o governo do PSDB com Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2003) e depois passou por um ciclo de governo com o PT, também fazendo parte da base. E desembarca apenas no momento em que a opinião pública começa a se movimentar em torno do campo da direita e de um antipetismo. E o Sarney também o faz.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Ou seja, fisiologismo. Certo?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> Sim, um fisiologismo. O MDB vem sendo descrito pela literatura da ciência política brasileira por características negativas e elas, às vezes, se estendem aos seus quadros. O Sarney é um exemplo disso. São figuras que parecem só existir enquanto estiverem atreladas ao governo e ao Estado. O partido DEM também é um exemplo disso. Ele vinha em uma trajetória de queda no número de filiados e, agora que volta ao governo em 2016, parece voltar à vida.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Mas seria o governo que depende do MDB ou o MDB que depende do governo?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> Todos os governos que foram eleitos entenderam como é que funciona o presidencialismo de coalizão brasileiro. E todos sacaram que precisariam do MDB para governar. O MDB, da sua parte, percebeu como se beneficiar desse sistema: não lançando candidato próprio à presidência da República, compondo chapa com aquele que eles acreditam ter a maior chance de ganhar e, ao mesmo tempo, lançando o máximo de candidatos ao legislativo, garantindo uma bancada grande. Esse último faz com que qualquer governo a ser eleito, independente de ser a sua chapa ou não, acaba tendo de recorrer a você.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> Em que ponto o Lula percebeu isso?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.:</strong> No primeiro mandato do Lula (2003-2006). A entrada do MDB se dá depois do Mensalão. Ali foi a sacada, quando ele [Lula] percebeu: “Olha, a gente vai ter que governar com esses caras, independente de quem seja, para aprovar minimamente a nossa agenda”.</p>\n<p><strong>TIB:</strong> E agora, que é presidente, Temer não pensaria em se lançar candidato?</p>\n<p><strong>R.M.: </strong>No momento em que ele se torna interino [maio de 2016], sim. Mas hoje acho muito difícil. Esse é o tipo de mosca azul, de ambição pessoal que passa pela cabeça de muitos políticos brasileiros, mas alguns percebem que não têm a força e o apoio popular que acham ter. E, para o Temer, isso deve ter ficado bem claro quando saíram as pesquisas apontando a rejeição a ele. Deve ter pensado: “Não, eu estava viajando, mesmo”.</p>\n<p>O [João] Doria é outro que achou que teria uma ascensão meteórica da prefeitura de São Paulo direto para a presidência da República.

        "content": "<p><u>When Hamilton Fish</u> became publisher and editorial director of the New Republic in February 2016, he faced a gargantuan task in turning around the storied publication, which was reeling from a series of abrupt ownership changes and mass staff turnover. But first, some spring cleaning: getting rid of the magazine’s human resources staff and shelving the employee handbook.</p>\n<p><span>When Fish took over, Paul Biboud-Lubeck was the director of people and finance, serving as the human resources manager. He left in June, and Fish never hired a replacement. Meanwhile, Fish took the employee handbook off the web, telling staff that he was updating it. “The story was he was revising it. I guess he was revising it for two years,” said one New Republic staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about their employer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish had previously served as president of the Nation Institute, before departing in 2009. Esther Kaplan, editor of the institute’s Investigative Fund, confirmed to The Intercept that Fish departed in the wake of allegations of misconduct. When the news broke that he was joining the New Republic, some women there were warned that Fish could be demeaning and creepy, HuffPost </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hamilton-fish-new-republic-nation-institute-women_us_59f79183e4b0c0c8e67c258e\"><span>reported</span></a><span>, and there had even been an incident in which he had placed his hands around a female colleague’s neck. The neck-grabbing incident “did not happen as described,” Fish told HuffPost.</span> <span>“I know it sounds self-serving, but anyone who knows me knows I would never harm a woman or another person.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Having heard the stories about Fish, some New Republic employees saw his failure to staff the HR department at his new stomping ground through that prism. They had a “sense that it was a perfect environment” for abuses against women, a former New Republic staffer told The Intercept, reflecting a widely held opinion among other current and former staffers interviewed for this article. Staffers, said the former employee, “had no power, no leverage to get him to stop, no one to tell what was happening to, and no reason to believe that they could speak out and still keep their jobs.”</span><span>  </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>It was reminiscent of the environment at the Nation Institute, in fact —  where reported inappropriate behavior “all took place against a backdrop where there was no personnel handbook and no one in an HR role,” a source who was on staff during Fish’s tenure told </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hamilton-fish-new-republic-nation-institute-women_us_59f79183e4b0c0c8e67c258e\"><span>HuffPost</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<div><a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/hamilton-fish-2-1514495527.jpg\"><img alt=\"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 26:  Producer Hamilton Fish (L) and execuitive producer Eric Eric Schlosser attend Tribeca Talks: After the Movie: &quot;Food Chains&quot; during the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival at SVA Theater on April 26, 2014 in New York City.

For decades, literary editor Leon Wieseltier lorded over New Republic staffers. He often made sexually charged comments in the newsroom, former employees </span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/24/leon-wieseltier-new-republic-emerson-collective-workplace-conduct-244120\"><span>told</span></a><span> Politico in October. Wieseltier, who left the New Republic in 2014 following a dispute with the magazine’s owner, said in a statement, “</span><span>For my offenses against some of my colleagues in the past I offer a shaken apology and ask for their forgiveness.”</span><span>  </span></p>\n<p><span>Last month, Fish resigned from the New Republic following complaints about his interactions with female employees, which the company had vowed to investigate.</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish, in an email, told The Intercept that when he arrived at the New Republic, the magazine’s “immediate staffing priorities were to increase diversity and to advance women into leadership roles.” This meant hiring a new HR manager wouldn’t be a priority until “the next hiring phase.” </span></p>\n<p><span>“We recognized that we needed a strong HR capacity, but we were also in the middle of trying to enlist new editorial staff people and we were scrambling for space in the budget to do so,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span>Fish said he gave the publication’s new editor, Eric Bates, the “mandate to recruit women and people of color to the magazine’s editorial staff and to promote them to senior positions” — an effort he said “was made challenging” in part by “the inherited reputation of the magazine as a men’s club.” Asked by The Intercept if Fish’s claim he told Bates to focus on hiring women and people of color was true, Bates declined to comment.</span></p>\n<p><span>As for the employee handbook, Fish said, “far from eliminating the employee handbook, we decided early on that the existing handbook would remain in force while we tackled the tougher issues in the review process, section by section.” </span></p>\n<p><span>For better or worse, the sexual abuse scandals engulfing companies both large and small have brought the role of human resources departments into sharp relief. Among the key purposes of human resources is to offer employees an avenue through which to air grievances about their working environment, as well as assist in seeking redress and solutions to problems. But such departments are no panacea — indeed, while HR professionals can appear to be supportive of victims or at least neutral in disputes between bosses and their staff, they can also become enablers of abuse by taking the side of the accused. This occurred most notoriously at the Weinstein Company, which allowed Harvey Weinstein to carry on his flagrant sexual exploitation of women for decades. At Vice, as the New York Times described recently in its </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/business/media/vice-sexual-harassment.html\"><span>exposé</span></a><span> of the company’s culture of harassment, HR repeatedly encouraged victims to accept it as normal. (Nancy Ashbrooke, Vice’s former HR director, told the Times, “</span><span>I support anyone who believes they have been mistreated and throughout my career, I have worked to help companies build respectful workplaces with no tolerance for inappropriate behavior.”) </span></p>\n<p><span>However, the absence of any HR department at many small news outlets creates a unique vulnerability for employees, whose fates may rest entirely in the hands of their often charismatic leaders or founders. AlterNet, another left-leaning news organization, is a textbook example of that phenomenon.</span></p>\n<p><span><u>AlterNet never had</u> anything resembling a human resources department, but it did have a “crying room” — the nickname women had given to their restroom at the Federal Street office in San Francisco. The progressive online outlet’s executive editor and founder, Don Hazen, submitted his resignation in December, after </span><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/coralewis/don-hazen?utm_term=.xvkb9Jzdx#.iuj0KGO7X\"><span>BuzzFeed News</span></a><span> reported that five women have accused him of sexual harassment during their time working for the site. </span>Hazen was particularly central to AlterNet because he had the personal relationships to maintain the site’s foundation funding, which makes up a considerable portion of its budget.</p>\n<p><span>The allegations against Hazen include inappropriate touching, discussing and asking employees about their sex lives in the office, making unwanted advances, and showing co-workers explicit photos — including one of his erect penis. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Intercept spoke to more than a dozen people with knowledge of Hazen’s actions, including 10 women who said Hazen harassed them by touching them inappropriately, bringing up their sex lives, or making unwanted advances. Most of the interviews were conducted before BuzzFeed published its article, but track closely with the allegations reported there. The sources described a toxic work environment, in which Hazen had sheer control, and staffers had little to no recourse available to report abuses. Most of them spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the information they were sharing. </span></p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">During my one year at AlterNet, no one held an HR session with us. No one told us how we could file complaints. No one ever told us how to settle conflicts with Don Hazen. He was AlterNet. I was told Don controlled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlterNet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AlterNet</a>'s board. We weren't protected from him.</p>\n<p>— Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Russian_Starr/status/945689199100952577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 26, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>“We take these allegations very seriously, and in turn, the Board of Directors of AlterNet’s parent organization, the Independent Media Institute, immediately placed Don on indefinite leave as we began to investigate these claims,” the board said in a</span> <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/message-alternets-board-directors\"><span>statement</span></a><span>. “As of today, Don submitted his resignation, which the board accepted, effective immediately. </span><span>Don has had a long and distinguished career, and his stewardship of AlterNet has been dedicated and imaginative for more than two decades. We all regret his tenure ended this way, but we want to reassure our readers and the broader AlterNet community that we are deeply confident about the future of AlterNet and are dedicated to continuing to work for its stability and success.</span><span>”</span></p>\n<p><span>Kristen Gwynne, who says she was sexually harassed by Hazen during her time at AlterNet, including inappropriate touching and advances, told The Intercept that the board’s statement “infuriated” her. </span></p>\n<p><span>“They kind of championed him and everything he’s done, and then they say ‘we regret that his tenure ended this way’ and that’s what infuriated me,” Gwynne said. “The fact that they regret his tenure ended this way and not that his tenure was characterized by persistent and egregious sexual harassment.” </span></p>\n<p><span>The other regret the board could have expressed is for AlterNet itself. As the internet first grew in popularity, AlterNet was one of the largest news sites of the day. Many of the country’s most talented writers cycled through at one point or another, many leaving in disgust at the toxic workplace environment. There are, to be sure, relentless external forces at work against the success of a progressive news outlet, but one of the most damaging can come from within. In an alternate universe in which AlterNet had a strong and supportive workplace culture, one that nurtured rather than repelled the talent it was able to attract, the site today could have been a home for some of the best journalists covering gender, power, and injustice. </span></p>\n<p><span>But that was not the AlterNet that was ultimately built. The board said in an earlier</span> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334932-Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-1-36-19-PM.html\"><span>statement</span></a><span> to BuzzFeed that no employee had submitted a complaint to them — which is part of the problem: Many former employees told The Intercept that Hazen handpicked friends of his to serve on the board, and staff had virtually no interaction with any of the board members.</span></p>\n<p><span>Reached for comment, two members of AlterNet’s board did not respond to detailed questions from The Intercept. Instead, one of them said the Independent Media Institute would be issuing a new public statement, but it has yet to materialize. </span></p>\n<p><span>Reached by phone last week, Hazen agreed to a phone interview for the following day, but did not specify a time. He put this reporter on hold for several minutes, eventually hanging up. Shortly thereafter, he responded to The Intercept’s request for comment in a message sent from his AlterNet email address. “Sorry for the call to be interrupted. As you probably know I have resigned from IMI -Alternet. So I am no longer in a position to speak for the organization,” he wrote. “I will pass on your interest to the board.” He did not respond to a detailed list of questions, except for one question about his approach to race in the newsroom. </span></p>\n<p>In an interview with BuzzFeed, Hazen said, “In the atmosphere of lots of discussion about editorial topics like sex and drugs, I lost track of some boundaries I needed to keep. I had personal conversations with staff I should not have had, made comments I should not have made, and take responsibility for failure to recognize the implications of my position and age in supervising people at that period.” But in an earlier <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334745-Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-12-19-48-PM.html\">statement</a> to BuzzFeed, he denied most of the allegations against him and said others had been mischaracterized.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If there was a mechanism for reporting harassment, nobody knew about it. The board members were hand-picked for their loyalty.</p>\n<p>I can't say that the current board knew about this stuff, but I know for a fact that more than one former board member did. <a href=\"https://t.co/FJLjPPypFl\">https://t.co/FJLjPPypFl</a></p>\n<p>— Joshua Holland (@JoshuaHol) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaHol/status/943945381230075912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 21, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Heather Gehlert, who was a managing editor at AlterNet from 2006 to 2009, said Hazen sexually harassed her, including, in one instance, trying “to rub my neck and back uninvited, without asking, without my consent, anything.” She never felt that going to the board about the harassment was an option because she was afraid that if she approached them, it “could mean some form of retaliation, including being fired.” In fact, she noted, she felt that she could be fired “for a lot less than going to the board,” reflecting an opinion shared by multiple former AlterNet staffers.</span></p>\n<p><span>“It felt like there was this feedback loop and everything would ultimately lead back to him, and I couldn’t imagine any way of trying to go to them or make anything more of those kinds of issues without getting fired for it,” Gehlert said.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sarah Jaffe, a freelance reporter who was on staff at AlterNet in New York from 2011 to 2012, said she doesn’t recall “ever getting a handbook or getting told where I should take complaints if I had any,” adding that board members “never interacted with any of us in a capacity of actually overseeing AlterNet.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“I was hired by Don. I was, you know, told what my job was by Don. I was overseen by Don. I would get belligerent 2 a.m. emails from Don,” Jaffe said. “I didn’t have anybody else. When anybody else was given oversight, it was constantly overruled by Don.”</span></p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I should have been able to go to an HR department at AlterNet, but Don was HR. That is what folks (and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlterNet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AlterNet</a>'s board) refuses to understand. The company was set up around Don Hazen. The workers were not told otherwise.</p>\n<p>— Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Russian_Starr/status/945687062589698048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 26, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>While Jaffe is not convinced that an HR manager — who, at the end of the day, would also have reported to Hazen — would have been able to do much, she acknowledged that if there had been an HR position, “at least somebody would have raised some hell at some point” by reporting mistreatment.  </span></p>\n<p><span>But Jaffe argues that the only way for workers to obtain real power is to have a union representative or shop steward “who is on the worker’s side.” In a place like AlterNet, where one person has almost total control over everything, other than workers “having actual power” through a union, Jaffe said, she’s not sure of anything else that “could’ve actually stopped” Hazen.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the Nation Institute, a union drive was partially motivated by precisely that concern, said Esther Kaplan. “We unionized the place almost as a desperation move to create some structures — not just harassment, but annual reviews, how to request raises. Everything was personal and depended on what your personal relationship was to the CEO, so that created all kinds of management issues,” Kaplan said. A sexual harassment policy was enshrined in the first union contract five years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I think that’s part of what’s interesting with what’s happening right now is it’s showing that, right now, what we have in place to deal with workplace sexual harassment is completely insufficient,” Gwynne said. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The criminal justice system is not equipped to handle it, labor regulations don’t seem to be up to par to handle it. And it’s bizarre now that suddenly, it’s like we’re in the court of public opinion and that’s doing the better job,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span>Thirteen former AlterNet employees told The Intercept the abusive management wasn’t just sexual in nature, as Hazen would constantly berate staffers. And Terrell Jermaine Starr, who worked at AlterNet from July 2014 to October 2015 and is now a senior reporter at The Root, said Hazen made “racially insensitive” and inappropriate comments. </span></p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/don-hazen-1514496014.jpg\"><img alt=\"NEW YORK - JULY 19:  Don Hazen, Executive Editor of AlterNet, (L) and Chellie Pingree, Common Cause President, tape-up a petition against FOX News at FOXs' headquarters July 19, 2004 in New York for its use of the tagline &quot;fair and balanced&quot;. The petition, which was filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by MoveOn.org and Common Cause, argues that FOX News displays a blatant Republican bias in its coverage and should therefore be stopped from using the term &quot;fair and balanced&quot;. The petition argues that the use of the term violates section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act for deceptive practices in advertising and marketing.

Though he initially tried to be discreet about his mental health, having no one else to turn to, he was eventually forced to tell Hazen why he needed to leave work for therapy sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I felt very uncomfortable talking to him about it, because one, I didn’t know him like that, for real, and two, who else could I go to?” Starr said. “I didn’t know that there was anyone in the organization where I could say, ‘I need this and I need that.’ That was never explained to me, so I felt like I had no other choice but to tell Don.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Often, HR departments help employees navigate issues related to their physical and mental health, including advising them on how to broach the topic with their bosses. Starr said his experience at AlterNet was starkly different from that at his previous job, where he was told “no one who I worked with at the editorial department had to know why I was gone for two days, for any reason. The HR department told the managers what was going on because I was protected under HIPAA.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Hazen told BuzzFeed that AlterNet had</span><span> no formal human resources office because the company was so small. </span><span>Regardless of size, companies are not required by law to have HR departments. Having a formal, written sexual harassment policy isn’t legally required either, though most companies have one anyway. </span></p>\n<p><span>“This is not just about Don Hazen. This is not just about any individual abuser,” said Heather Gehlert. “It’s about wider systems in our workplaces and broader cultural norms that allow this type of behavior to continue for years and, in some cases, decades.” </span></p>\n<p><span>In the wake of Fish’s departure from the New Republic and the Nation Institute, both institutions took steps that belie the notion that cash-strapped organizations can’t afford to put structures in place to guard against harassment or abuse. The New Republic’s new editor, J.J. Gould, has made building such a system a high priority, staffers there say, and the site is now hiring for a full-time HR position. The handbook, disappeared by Fish, has been found and re-activated. </span></p>\n<p><span>And at the Nation Institute, a handbook that Fish was endlessly working on but never implemented has been substantially revised and distributed. The handbooks at both organizations specify multiple avenues for filing complaints. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Obviously structures aren’t magic,” Kaplan said. To figure out what kinds of procedures to put in place in the wake of Fish’s departure, Kaplan said, “we did a lot of asking around — and [we found that] you need multiple lines of report. If you set up a sexual harassment reporting policy where there’s one choke point, — the HR person, CEO, the deputy — if that person is perceived as tight with the perpetrator, nobody will report. Multiple avenues to report is critical.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Under the new system, she said, complaints can be filed to the CEO, the board’s executive committee, or a direct supervisor. The key is to actually implement a policy. Under Fish, she said, “In theory there was a process to create guidelines, but it was never put into place.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>Correction: January 5, 2018, 11:39 a.m.</strong><br>\nAn earlier version of this piece incorrectly referred to AlterNet’s Federal Street office in San Francisco as being in New York.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/05/new-republic-hamilton-fish-alternet-don-hazen/\">New Republic, AlterNet, and Nation Institute Had No Real HR When Abuses Occurred</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Os direitos de muçulmanos, imigrantes e indígenas norte-americanos foram atropelados. Pessoas <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/16/u-n-security-counil-saudi-arabia-blockade-yemen-famine-iran/\" target=\"_blank\">morrem de fome</a> no Iêmen.

E os políticos que se dizem progressistas parecem estar constrangidos demais para agir como deveriam.</p>\n<p>Houve também derrotas mais concretas, e foram muitas.</p>\n<p>O súbito ataque cardíaco e o coma que levaram à morte de Erica Garner, de 27 anos, mãe e ativista contra a violência policial, até fez sentido como ato final de 2017. Sua morte foi um desfecho terrível para um ano incrivelmente difícil. Erica era minha amiga, e eu confiava nela. Era a pessoa mais honesta e autêntica do mundo. Ela praticava o exercício diário de dizer a verdade aos que estão no poder e não tinha paciência para enrolação. É à sombra de sua morte precoce que contemplo 2018 e tento imaginar o que nos aguarda.</p>\n<p>Melhor começar pelas coisas que não vão acontecer em 2018.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump não vai sofrer um impeachment, ponto final. Em primeiro lugar, porque independentemente do que o promotor especial Robert Mueller descubra em sua investigação, o Partido Republicano continuará controlando o Congresso pelo menos até janeiro de 2019. Até lá, mesmo que o Partido Democrata consiga vitórias arrasadoras nas eleições de meio de mandato, os Republicanos que já estão no poder não irão dar seguimento a um processo de impeachment. Eles já estão envolvidos demais, atrelados à liderança de Trump e ao seu legado. Ainda que a investigação de Mueller venha a acusar alguém próximo de Trump de obstruir as investigações ou de praticar algum crime relativo ao conluio com governos estrangeiros, Trump não renunciaria de forma alguma. Tudo isso para dizer que 2018 será mais um ano com Trump na presidência dos EUA, e é inútil tentar imaginar qualquer cenário diferente.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Depois de tomar uma surra, você pode simplesmente manter a mesma estratégia e continuar perdendo, ou pode repensar tudo, se recompor, e só então voltar à luta.</blockquote>\n<p><u>Ainda assim,</u> há espaço para algumas vitórias, e é isso que espero que aconteça em 2018:</p>\n<p>2018 vai ser o ano da reorganização. Depois de tomar uma surra daquelas, você pode simplesmente manter a mesma estratégia e continuar perdendo, ou pode repensar tudo, se recompor, e só então voltar à luta, agora com mais chances de ganhar. É uma lição que precisamos aprender com a Erica: organizar, organizar, organizar. Para fazer as coisas acontecerem, é preciso estar presente, trabalhando, especialmente diante das adversidades.</p>\n<p>Se conseguirmos fazer isso, 2018 será um ano de planos melhores e ações mais bem executadas. Em 2017, tivemos várias derrotas seguidas no campo da <a href=\"https://injusticetoday.com/the-top-criminal-justice-wins-of-2017-6bbe0597b8e1\" target=\"_blank\">reforma do sistema criminal</a>, mas cada vitória – de alguns avanços essenciais no tratamento de jovens infratores à ampliação da legalização e descriminalização da maconha – exigiu muita luta e bastante organização. Alguns promotores mais reformistas foram eleitos em 2017. Nos EUA, passaremos a usar, de 2018 em diante, o que aprendemos e compreendemos nessas eleições em centenas de outras corridas eleitorais no âmbito do ministério público — disputas que até então estavam em segundo plano.</p>\n<p>Na segunda-feira, dia 1º de janeiro, o uso recreativo da maconha se tornou lícito na Califórnia. Esse é um avanço que não pode ser desprezado. O impacto que terá no sistema de justiça e na economia da Califórnia é imenso. E a Califórnia dita o ritmo para boa parte dos EUA. À medida que outros estados perceberem os benefícios, 2018 será o ano em que um número recorde de cidades e estados começarão a seguir o exemplo, promovendo as reformas necessárias ou criando os mecanismos para analisar a questão. (E ainda falando da Califórnia, o estado também fará significativo progresso na ampliação da assistência universal de saúde.)</p>\n<p>Legalizar a maconha significa que, em 2018, veremos um movimento crescente para limpar a ficha criminal de pessoas que foram condenadas por crimes relativos a essa droga na Califórnia e em outros lugares. Haverá também avanços na restauração do direito ao voto para ex-presidiários em todo o país [nos EUA, existem prazos após o cumprimento da pena para que seja restaurado o direito ao voto].</p>\n<p>Por fim, teremos um comparecimento recorde às urnas de todo o país em 2018 para as importantes eleições de meio de mandato, igual ou mesmo maior que o das últimas eleições presidenciais. Essa tendência deve se manter em 2019 e 2020, e provavelmente levará Democratas e progressistas em geral a começarem a recuperar poder.</p>\n<p>Há muito trabalho pela frente. Nada disso será fácil. Mas se nos esforçarmos, podemos esperar tudo isso e muito mais. Podemos encontrar nosso caminho rumo ao progresso.</p>\n<p>Foto do título: Erica Garner, que faleceu no final de dezembro de 2017, segura as lágrimas enquanto conversa com a imprensa em 11 de dezembro de 2014, em Staten Island, NY, depois de liderar uma marcha que protestava contra a decisão do júri de não indiciar o policial envolvido na morte de seu pai, Eric Garner, por estrangulamento, em julho de 2014.</p>\n<p><em>Tradução: Deborah Leão</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/05/nos-eua-e-no-mundo-foram-muitas-as-derrotas-em-2017-o-que-podemos-esperar-de-2018/\">Nos EUA e no mundo, foram muitas as derrotas em 2017.

        "content": "<p><u>When a panicked</u> stranger emailed me this past weekend to say that police in Cartersville, Georgia, had “locked up a hundred kids when they claimed to find less than an ounce of weed at a house party,” I didn’t need to ask if the kids were black. I already knew. Police departments across north Georgia, a region north of Atlanta where Cartersville is located, just aren’t that likely to arrest 100 white kids at a house party if they discovered less than an ounce of marijuana.</p>\n<p>But that’s exactly what happened in Cartersville. When I searched for local news reports in Atlanta and found that police actually arrested, charged, and jailed these people — the overwhelming majority of them young and black — for marijuana possession, I was initially puzzled. Had all 70 of them possessed marijuana? Nope.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Many of the men and women who were arrested were then fired from their jobs after they were left in jail for days on end.</blockquote>\n<p>After claiming to find less than an ounce of weed in total — which has a street value of around $150 to $200 and would mean only a ticket in the nearby city of Atlanta — police in Cartersville charged all 70 people gathered for a birthday party — including men, women, boys, and girls, ranging from the ages of 15 to 31 — with drug possession and hauled them off to Bartow County Jail.</p>\n<p>A pregnant woman <a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/ten-of-the-at-least-70-people-arrested-during-21st-birthday-party/674439253\">said</a> she was verbally abused and mistreated in jail. Another person said they were threatened with Tasers and locked in actual cages. Some of the attendees were military veterans and college students who were home for the holidays. Others <a href=\"http://www.daily-tribune.com/newsx/item/9720-70-arrested-by-cartersville-police-early-sunday-morning\">were standout student athletes</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of these people’s lives will be ruined because of that small amount of marijuana. Scores of lawyers have been hired; nearly $100,000 in bail money was paid; and good people — who, for all we or the cops know, have never even smoked weed — are wondering if they are about to have a criminal record. Their mugshots were publicly released. Unable to afford bail, many of the men and women who were arrested were then fired from their jobs after they were left in jail for days on end.</p>\n<p>“I thought they were just gonna shut the party down and everybody was going to go home,” <a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/ten-of-the-at-least-70-people-arrested-during-21st-birthday-party/674439253\">said Deja Heard</a>, who had rented the home on Airbnb for her 21st birthday. And the partygoers didn’t even understand what was happening: “We did not know what we were going to jail for,” said Nija Guider in an interview with Tyisha Fernandes of Atlanta’s CBS affiliate. Other attendees said police initially had told them to get into the police vans to get warm since it was freezing cold outside — only to keep them there and haul them off to jail.</p>\n<p><u>This is something</u> you might expect in north Georgia. I know Georgia and these parts of it well. I lived in Atlanta for most of my adult life — the actual city. North Georgia likes to consider itself part of Atlanta, but it’s not. One of the reasons is that it’s outside a belt around the city where the dynamics surrounding race suddenly change. That’s not to say that black people don’t face the risk of arrest for marijuana in the immediate Atlanta area; in fact, the two Georgia counties that make up Atlanta and some of its surroundings have some of the most racially disproportionate rates of marijuana arrests in the U.S., according to a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.creativeloafing.com/news/article/13074008/aclu-fulton-and-dekalbs-marijuana-arrest-rates-are-among-the-most-racially-biased-in-the-country\">study</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">The arrests happened outside a belt around the city where the dynamics surrounding race suddenly change.</blockquote>\n<p>I was warned about this radius around Atlanta — where the rules change — when I first moved to the city to attend Morehouse College in 1997. During our first week of orientation at the historically black college, our campus police department and freshman dean had flat-out told us that we should expect to be confronted with blatant racism if we traveled more than 15 miles in any direction from campus. The warning went on: If we traveled more than 30 miles out of Atlanta and got in any type of trouble, it was unlikely they could help us.</p>\n<p>Cartersville is a good 45 miles from the city — well past that invisible 30-mile barrier we were warned to never cross. It’s Trump country: The president <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/georgia/\">got 76 percent of the vote there</a>. The KKK <a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/11/02/msnbc-show-focuses-on-kkk-newspapers-dropped-on-north-georgia-lawns/\">distributed newspapers on lawns</a> throughout the city before the election plastered with Donald Trump’s face and his “Make America Great Again” slogan. This past November when a black family put a house under contract in Cartersville, <a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/cartersville/bullying-to-keep-minorities-out-vandals-write-kkk-i-will-kill-you-on-house/85-495838851\">it got vandalized</a> and had the letters “KKK” spray-painted everywhere.</p>\n<p>It’s just the type of town where police would round up cars and vans and buses full of young black folks after finding less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>This is why so many of us in the criminal justice reform community are advocating for the full legalization of marijuana. These arrests were a gross overreach of the justice system. It is fundamentally absurd that all of these resources have been wasted, and dozens were forced to endure days in jail because a small bag of marijuana was found at a house party.</p>\n<p>If that party in Cartersville had been a mostly white fraternity bash or a birthday party dominated by white folks, there’s no way in hell the police would have rolled up and arrested 70 people like this, for a small amount of marijuana that no one claimed.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/04/cartersville-georgia-ounce-marijuana-arrests-weed/\">Being Black in Trump Country: Dozens of People Arrested for Less Than an Ounce of Weed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

I think it was two weeks ago or three weeks ago, there were 1,000 clerics rounded up or put under house arrest or whatever. I realize that the opposition party in the New York Times refer to most of them as ‘liberal scholars.’”</span></p>\n<p><span>Trump invited bin Salman to the White House in March, in what Wolff says was an “aggressive bit of diplomacy.” The Saudi royal was “using this Trump embrace as part of his own power play in the kingdom. And the Trump White House, ever denying this was the case, let him.” In exchange, Wolff writes, bin Salman “offered a basket of deals and announcements that would coincide with” Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, giving the president a “win.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The president’s son-in-law and trusted adviser Jared Kushner is said to be close to bin Salman. Kushner visited Saudi Arabia in October, where he and the crown prince stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, “swapping stories and planning strategy,” the Washington Post </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-saudi-crown-princes-risky-power-play/2017/11/05/4b12fcf0-c272-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.04a5330f969b\"><span>reported</span></a><span>. A few days later, bin Salman arrested nearly a dozen members of Saudi’s ruling elite.</span></p>\n<p><span>Just weeks before bin Salman assumed the role of crown prince, Saudi Arabia had cut diplomatic relations with Qatar and launched a blockade against the neighboring peninsula. Trump took credit for the move on Twitter. </span></p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology.

As reuniões foram convocadas e presididas pela ministra da Justiça Ayelet Shaked, que é pró-assentamentos e figura entre os <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2015/10/state-solution-valid-solution-151013081528610.html\">mais extremistas</a> e <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20160628-just-one-in-five-israeli-ministers-openly-back-two-state-solution/\">autoritários</a> funcionários do governo israelense. Os encontros começaram depois que Israel fez ameaças: se as ordens para deletar os perfis não fossem voluntariamente cumpridas, as autoridades apelariam para a justiça e para a legislação em vigor, e o Facebook correria o risco de ter que pagar multas altas ou até de ser bloqueado no país.</p>\n<p>Os previsíveis resultados desses encontros agora estão claros e bem documentados. Sob direção do governo israelense, o Facebook iniciou uma onda de censura a ativistas palestinos que protestam contra a duradoura ocupação ilegal de Israel. As autoridades israelenses têm se <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/facebook-neutral-palestine-israel-conflict-160921115752070.html\">gabado em público</a> da obediência do Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Logo que foi noticiada a existência do acordo entre o governo de Israel e o Facebook, a ministra da Justiça Ayelet Shaked informou que, nos últimos quatro meses, Tel Aviv teria apresentado ao gigante das mídias sociais 158 solicitações para remover conteúdo considerado “incitação”. Segundo a ministra, o Facebook aceitou 95% dessas solicitações.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ela está correta. Não é exagero dizer que o Facebook é submisso ao Estado de Israel. Conforme <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/facebook-struggles-to-put-out-online-fires-in-israeli-palestinian-conflict.html\">descreveu</a> o New York Times em dezembro de 2016, “as agências de segurança israelenses monitoram o Facebook e encaminham à empresa postagens consideradas incitadoras. O Facebook responde removendo a maior parte delas.”</p>\n<p>O que torna essa censura especialmente grave é <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-facebook-activist-journalist-arrests-censorship-accusations-incitement-a7377776.html\">que</a> “96% dos palestinos declararam usar o Facebook principalmente para acompanhar as notícias.” Isso significa que os funcionários do governo israelense têm um controle praticamente irrestrito sobre um fórum de comunicação essencial dos palestinos.</p>\n<p>Nas semanas que se seguiram às reuniões, como <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-facebook-activist-journalist-arrests-censorship-accusations-incitement-a7377776.html\">noticiou The Independent</a>, “o coletivo de ativistas Centro Palestino de Informações relatou que pelo menos dez perfis dos administradores de suas páginas em árabe e em inglês no Facebook — seguidas por mais de 2 milhões de pessoas — foram suspensos, sete deles de forma permanente. Para eles, isso é resultado das novas medidas implementadas após os encontros entre o Facebook e Israel”.  Em março do ano passado, o Facebook tirou brevemente do ar a página do partido político Fatah, que tem milhões de seguidores, “em decorrência de uma postagem contendo uma foto antiga do ex-líder <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/yasser-arafat.html\">Yasser Arafat</a> segurando um rifle”.</p>\n<p>Um <a href=\"http://www.madacenter.org/images/text_editor/FBviolationsE.pdf\">relatório de 2016</a> do Centro Palestino para o Desenvolvimento e a Liberdade detalha a extensão da censura do Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Páginas e perfis pessoais que foram filtrados e bloqueados: Rede Palestina de Diálogo (PALDF.net); Gaza Now; Rede de Notícias de Jerusalém; a agência Shibab; Rádio Belém 2000; Rede de Rádio do Oriente; a página Mesh Heck; a agência de notícias Ramallah News; os jornalistas Huzaifa Jamous, de Abu Dis, e Kamel Jbeil; os ativistas Qassam Bedier, Mohammed Ghannam e Abdel-Qader al-Titi; perfis administrativos da página Al Quds; e os jovens ativistas Hussein Shajaeih, Ramah Mubarak (perfil  ativo), Ahmed Abdel Aal (perfil ativo), Mohammad Za’anin (perfil excluído), Amer Abu Arafa (perfil excluído) e Abdulrahman al-Kahlout (perfil excluído).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nem é preciso dizer que os israelenses têm total liberdade para publicar o que quiserem sobre palestinos. São comuns no Facebook postagens <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/patrick-strickland/bombing-gaza-children-gives-me-orgasm-israelis-celebrate-slaughter-facebook\">incitando à matança de palestinos</a>, sem sofrer qualquer tipo de intervenção.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/vengeance-1514640203.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/vengeance-1514640203-1000x781.png\" class=\"wp-image-164448\"></a>\n<p>“Campanha no Facebook pede ‘vingança’ contra árabes”</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Como <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/facebook-neutral-palestine-israel-conflict-160921115752070.html\">mostrou reportagem da Al Jazeera em 2016</a>, “discurso incendiário postado em hebraico […] chama muito menos atenção das autoridades israelenses e do Facebook”. Um estudo constatou que “122 mil usuários conclamavam diretamente a práticas violentas, usando palavras como ‘assassinar’, ‘matar’ ou ‘queimar’. Os árabes eram os principais destinatários dos comentários de ódio.” Não parece, no entanto, que o Facebook esteja empenhado em censurar esse tipo de conteúdo.</p>\n<p>Embora postagens mais explícitas de incitação à matança sejam removidas, a rede social continua a permitir a proliferação de discurso de ódio contra palestinos. O líder israelense Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/7/gaza-israel-palestiniantwitterfacebook.html\">tem usado as mídias sociais com frequência</a> para fazer publicações que claramente incitam a violência contra palestinos em geral. Em contraste com a repressão ativa do Facebook aos palestinos, é inimaginável que o Facebook venha a usar seu poder de censura contra Netanyahu ou outras autoridades israelenses que encorajam a violência e incitam ataques. Como <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/facebook-neutral-palestine-israel-conflict-160921115752070.html\">resumiu</a> a Al Jazeera, “o Facebook não se reuniu com os líderes palestinos para discutir suas preocupações”.</p>\n<p><u>Agora o Facebook</u> parece admitir que também pretende cumprir as ordens de censura do governo dos EUA. No começo da semana passada, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/world/europe/chechnya-kadyrov-facebook.html\">empresa excluiu</a> os perfis de Facebook e Instagram de Ramzan Kadyrov, o líder autoritário, repressor e violento da República da Chechênia, que tinha um total de 4 milhões de seguidores. Sem exagero, Kadyrov — que governa a província com total liberdade em troca de absoluta lealdade a Moscou — é o oposto de uma figura simpática: ele já foi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/victim-chechnya-anti-gay-purge-urges-russia-investigate-maxim-lapunov\">acusado </a>de um amplo espectro de violações aos direitos humanos, que vão desde encarceramento e tortura de pessoas LGBT a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/europe/26chechen.html\">sequestro e assassinato </a>de dissidentes.</p>\n<p>Nada disso, porém, ameniza a justificativa perigosa e assustadora que o Facebook deu para excluir os perfis. Um assessor informou ao New York Times que a empresa não excluiu esses perfis porque Kadyrov é um tirano assassino, mas “porque ele foi incluído numa lista de sanções dos Estados Unidos, e a empresa tinha o dever legal de tomar providências”.</p>\n<p>Como observou o próprio Times, essa justificativa é dúbia, ou, no mínimo, de aplicação inconsistente: outras pessoas que constam da mesma lista de sanções, como o presidente da Venezuela Nicolás Maduro, continuam ativas no Facebook e no Instagram. Atentemos, porém, à enorme ameaça contida nas alegações do Facebook.</p>\n<p>O significado é óbvio: o governo dos EUA — que, nesse momento, é o governo Trump — detém o poder unilateral e ilimitado de forçar a remoção de quem quiser do Facebook e do Instagram, bastando para isso incluir essas pessoas numa lista de sanções. Será que alguém considera essa consequência positiva? Alguém confia no governo Trump, ou em qualquer outro, para obrigar as plataformas de mídias sociais a excluir e bloquear quem eles quiserem silenciar? Como declarou ao New York Times Jennifer Granick, da União Americana das Liberdades Civis (ACLU):</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lei não parece ter sido pensada ou escrita para lidar com situações especiais em que seja lícito ou adequado reprimir um discurso. […] A lei de sanções está sendo usada para reprimir discursos sem maiores preocupações com o valor da liberdade de expressão e os riscos específicos da censura, em contraste com os bloqueios comerciais ou de recursos que eram o objetivo inicial das sanções. Isso é bem complicado.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A política do Facebook de bloquear pessoas de sua plataforma se aplica a todos os governos? Claro que não. É óbvio que se o Irã, por exemplo, decidisse impor sanções a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/363465-schumer-advised-trump-on-declaring-jerusalem-as-israels-capital\">Chuck Schumer por seu apoio à política de Trump</a> de reconhecer Jerusalém como a capital de Israel, o Facebook não excluiria os perfis do membro do Partido Democrata e líder da minoria no Senado — da mesma forma que não excluiria os perfis dos agentes do governo israelense que incitam a violência contra os palestinos ou que sofrem sanções de autoridades palestinas. No final de 2017, a Rússia <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/canada-russia-magnitsky-sanctions-united-states-browder/28834596.html\">anunciou suas próprias sanções retaliatórias</a> contra diversos executivos e autoridades do Canadá, mas, como esperado, o Facebook não tomou quaisquer providências para censurá-los ou bloquear seus perfis.</p>\n<p>Na mesma linha, será que o Facebook se atreveria a censurar políticos ou jornalistas americanos que usam as mídias sociais para incitar a violência contra os inimigos dos EUA? Nesse caso, basta formular a pergunta e ela já está respondida.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/violence-1514640798.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/violence-1514640798-540x530.png\" class=\"wp-image-164450\"></a>\n<p>Acima, título de notícia diz: “Para mostrar nossa determinação, talvez tenhamos que afundar um navio iraniano”. Logo abaixo, tuíte de Michael Grunwald: “Não vejo a hora de escrever em defesa do drone que vai acabar com Julian Assange”.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Como é<em> sempre</em> o caso na censura, só existe um princípio que norteia sua aplicação: o poder. O Facebook se sujeita às exigências de governos e autoridades com efetivo poder sobre ele, e ignora os que não o detêm. Por essa razão, os inimigos declarados dos EUA e de Israel estão vulneráveis às medidas de censura pelo Facebook, ao contrário das autoridades estadunidenses e israelenses (e seus aliados mais tirânicos e repressores):</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/faz3-1514639920.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/faz3-1514639920-1000x587.png\" class=\"wp-image-164447\"></a> </div>\n<p>Tudo isso prova que os mesmos graves riscos decorrentes da censura estatal <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/08/21/twitter-facebook-executives-arbiters-see-read/\">podem surgir do pleito para que os gigantes do Vale do Silício</a> censurem de forma mais ativa os “discursos ruins”.

None of that was true, but she did give her real name: Jaime Phillips. Some online sleuthing eventually connected the dots: She was a plant sent by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas to attempt to embarrass the Post.</p>\n<p><span>Previous O’Keefe infiltrators at different organizations had used fake names, and an O’Keefe operative is unlikely to make the mistake of being honest next time, which would make unraveling the scheme more difficult for the next targeted group. </span></p>\n<p><span>So one of O’Keefe’s previous victims has a solution: an expansive dossier of 149 of O’Keefe’s known associates, meant to serve as a resource for activists, lawyers, and journalists.</span></p>\n<p><span>“<a href=\"https://www.projectveritas.exposed/\">ProjectVeritas.Exposed</a>” – a project of The Undercurrent, a political web show sponsored by American Family Voices — is made up of dozens of profiles of undercover operatives, funders, and other O’Keefe associates, with information compiled from social media and news articles, and in some cases, information from interviews conducted with targets. The Intercept was able to review the dossier ahead of its publication. </span></p>\n<p><span>The dossier was largely assembled by Undercurrent Executive Producer Lauren Windsor, who has long battled O’Keefe online. Windsor is a partner at the firm </span><span>Democracy Partners, which was infiltrated by O’Keefe last year and is </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/01/james-okeefe-sued-sting-democracy-partners-million-dollar-lawsuit/\"><span>currently suing</span></a><span> him, Project Veritas, and operatives Allison Maass and Dan Sandini.</span></p>\n<p>Maass posed as a progressive activist, using a cover story and falsified documents to obtain an internship with Democracy Partners. The website, displaying the profiles as a photo array, scrolls back to associates from O’Keefe’s days as a student at Rutgers University, where he started a conservative magazine called The Centurion.</p>\n<p><span>The site devotes a section to Project Veritas funding as well, as the group has been sanctioned or denied a license to seek donations in Utah, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Maine, and is at risk of losing its ability to fundraise in New York,</span> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/florida-bars-project-veritas-founder-james-okeefe-from-fundraising-due-to-criminal-conviction/2017/12/08/f20a05c4-dc41-11e7-a841-2066faf731ef_story.html?utm_term=.095d583d5026\"><span>according to</span></a><span> the Washington Post. There’s also a Florida fundraising ban that applies specifically to O’Keefe and not the organization. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Project Veritas isn’t required to disclose donors.</span></p>\n<p><span>O’Keefe’s many public misfires have cost his organization credibility in the mainstream press and political circles, but Windsor argues that as long as he has a link to the Trump administration, he should be considered dangerous.</span></p>\n<p><span>“James O’Keefe has shown himself </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WDWLeRKc2Y&t=9s\"><span>to be an agent</span></a><span> of Donald Trump,” said Windsor. “Trump’s foundation donated $20,000 to O’Keefe in 2015, and O’Keefe proceeded to target Trump’s Democratic rivals for the presidency, embedding operatives within both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns. O’Keefe’s schemes conveniently provided ammunition for Trump talking points on voter fraud, violence at Trump rallies, and the ‘fake news’ media. This is political espionage and it’s a major threat to election integrity.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Embedding in political campaigns is becoming a staple of O’Keefe’s </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfucking\"><span>election-year ratfucking.</span></a><span> In 2016, beyond Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, O’Keefe tried to embed operatives as interns or volunteers within the Senate campaigns of Democrats </span><span>Russ Feingold, Deborah Ross, and Ted Strickland. O’Keefe didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: James O’Keefe, President of Project Veritas Action, walls to the podium to speak at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/project-veritas-james-okeefe-washington-post-roy-moore/\">New Project Veritas Dossier Compiles Photos of James O’Keefe’s Known Associates</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

As a reporter for the New York Times, Risen broke some of the most important stories of the post 9/11 era, from the warrantless surveillance against Americans conducted under the Bush-Cheney administration, to black prison sites run by the CIA, to failed covert actions in Iran. Risen has won the Pulitzer and other major journalism awards. But perhaps what he is now most famous for is fighting a battle under both the Bush and Obama administrations as they demanded — under threat of imprisonment —the name of one of Risen’s alleged confidential sources. In the end, Risen prevailed and refused to testify and he was not locked up. But during the course of his case, there were rulings that could have far reaching implications for journalists, particularly in a climate where the president of the United States is characterizing news outlets as enemies of the people, contemplating arresting reporters, and is conducting at least 27 leak investigations. All before the end of his first year in office.</p>\n<p>But it isn’t just the government that Risen had to fight. He also battled his own editors and other powerful figures at the New York Times. Some of those people pushed the narrative that Iraq had WMDs and they regularly colluded with senior officials at the CIA, NSA, and White House in an effort to kill — or delay publication of — Risen’s stories. James Risen has now <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/\">written an extensive account of his years at the New York Times</a> and he names names.</p>\n<p>Risen is now a senior national security correspondent at The Intercept where his incredible inside story has now been published. We talked with Risen about his career at the New York Times in a special edition of Intercepted. Below is the transcript of that conversation.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Jeremy Scahill:</strong> Jim, welcome to this special edition of Intercepted.</p>\n<p><strong>James Risen:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So, as I read this piece, first of all, I just have to say it’s phenomenal and unusual. I can’t recall a national security reporter writing this kind of personal, autobiographical, chronicling of their time as a reporter, the challenges they face working for the most reputable newspaper in the world and fighting battles against both Republican and Democratic administrations. So, you know, I encourage people to read every word of this article.</p>\n<p>And I’m particularly struck by what I believe is just a fact that this piece is going to be so educational and inspirational for young reporters who aspire to do the kind of work that you’ve done, Jim, as a national security reporter.</p>\n<p>So, I’d like to start from the beginning and have you explain how you decided to become a national security reporter and how you got into all of this.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> My first job was in 1978 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, just as a local reporter. And then I went to the Miami Herald, and the Detroit Free Press, and then the LA Times. And throughout most of that time, I was covering either business or economics. And, I covered the auto industry, and then I came to Washington for the LA Times, and I was covering economic policy: the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. It was interesting for a while, but I started getting bored and I wanted to do something different.</p>\n<p>So, in about 1995, I told my editors at the LA Times that I wanted to do something different besides economics. And they kept ignoring me for a long time and finally, said, “OK, well, we have this job where you cover the State Department Latin American policy halftime and then you can cover the CIA halftime,” because they didn’t really have a full-time intelligence reporter back then.</p>\n<p>And I said, “OK, I’ll take that.” And then I never covered the State Department Latin American policy. I just started covering the CIA full time.</p>\n<p>After a while, they let me just keep doing that, and they forgot that I was supposed to also be covering the State Department halftime. And, I kind of fell into the perfect time to start covering intelligence because the Cold War had just ended and the year before I started covering the CIA, Aldrich Ames had been arrested as a Soviet spy and that just caused enormous turmoil and turnover at the CIA.</p>\n<p>And all the top people who had been reprimanded for failing to recognize that Ames was a spy for all those years were getting out of the CIA and they were all really bitter. There was a whole generation of people who really left the CIA all at once in the mid-90s and many of them were mad at the way that they had been portrayed in the press previously, because of the Ames case or whatever. And so, they were looking for somebody new to talk to, and many of them had never talked to a reporter before, but they didn’t like the press coverage that the CIA had been getting while the Ames case was going on. So, they were looking for somebody new who had never written anything about that before.</p>\n<p>And, so, it was a perfect time for me in that I was the new guy, and they all wanted to talk to somebody — a lot of them came to me.</p>\n<p>And the CIA was really like a high school. It was filled with cliques and little groups of networks of people and that once you got in with one or two of those guys, they would introduce you to a whole legion of people. And, so, it didn’t take long before I just found just a lot of people wanting to talk. And, it was before all the crackdown on leaks and before the government cared one way or the other about leaks of information. It was a fantastic time to cover the CIA. Also, there weren’t very many other reporters doing it back then. It was just a handful of reporters and so there weren’t very many people to compete against.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> How did your views shift from when you were outside looking in to when you started to, as they say in the business, make sources and get inside scoops of what was happening at the agency.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Well, before I started covering it, I had the general kind of citizen’s view of it as this very secretive, imposing, intimidating place that must do all the things people thought it did, kind of the James Bond view of it. And once I got into it, I realized: these are just normal bureaucrats who are doing things that are secret. And, I realized, after a while, a lot of them were keeping things secret just because they were hiding how incompetent they were. That secrecy was really just a way to get away with things that they shouldn’t be getting away with. It didn’t dawn on me at first. That took a while for me to figure out. But what I came away with was this sense that there was —  secrecy, in some cases, was valid on what they were doing, but in a lot of cases, it was more to hide politically embarrassing things or just pure incompetence or corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> What were some of the stories that you did while you were at the LA Times or, rather, pre-9/11 that stand out to you?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> There was a big case of sexual discrimination by women employees at the CIA right when I was starting to cover the agency. And so, I went to the courthouse — 90 percent of the job of covering the CIA is trying to figure out how do you meet people, because they’re not supposed to meet reporters and they can get in trouble, even back then, they could get in trouble for meeting reporters. And so, the logistics of gaining access to people is a huge part of the job, much bigger part than it is for any other beat.</p>\n<p>So, I heard that there was this class-action lawsuit by a whole bunch of women case officers at the CIA. And so, I went to the court and I started trying to meet them. I got to know some of them, and that was the first big way I got information about what was going on at the CIA.</p>\n<p>After that, I just started going to every kind of event where I could think of where there might be somebody from the agency and just trying to find ways to introduce myself to them. And what I found after a while was a lot of these people who were now leaving the agency or were still there, they had no idea what they knew that was newsworthy. They were really kind of clueless about the larger world, which I always found very odd. I mean, they were very good at being secret agents, if you will, but they were kind of naive about the larger world, which I found astounding.</p>\n<p>I remember this guy started — he wanted to talk about this very minor bureaucratic problem at the CIA and he went on and on about it, and in the middle of this long conversation we were having, he says, “Yeah, and is just like how Clinton gave a green light to Iran to smuggle weapons into the Balkans.” And he said, “There’s this big investigation inside the intelligence community over it.” And then he starts going back to this minor bureaucratic battle in our conversation. And I was like, I said, “Wait a second. Go back to what you just said.”</p>\n<p>That was the first big scoop I had at The LA Times, was that Clinton had basically worked with the Iranians, allowed them to smuggle weapons into the Balkans to help the Bosnian Muslims.</p>\n<p>I mean, you could make the case that that maybe was justifiable as an end result, but it was a — it went against all U.S. policy and international policy and so it led to a big investigation.</p>\n<p>And then, I remember, after this guy told me about it, I went to — there was this very secretive little organization called the Intelligence Oversight Board which was, at that time, a subcommittee of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Both of those are White House creations that usually never deal with the press and don’t have much to do with anything.</p>\n<p>What I had been told was that the Intelligence Oversight Board was doing an investigation for Clinton of this whole arms channel with Iran that he had secretly set up. And I found out that the Intelligence Oversight Board was one lawyer who was a Clinton lawyer, who was a Clinton friend, who had a law office in Washington, and so the IOB was his office. And I went to talk to him, and I told him what I knew and he kept saying, “I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’ve never heard of any such thing.”</p>\n<p>Then about a week later, the same guy called me back and said, “Now, I can talk to you about all this.” It was like this weird dance that I was doing that you as a reporter, you begin to realize, you kinda know when somebody tells you they don’t know anything about something, they really do know all about it</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> For people that maybe don’t remember the Bosnian war, the Yugoslav civil war, just to remind people, you had Croatia, which was a Catholic republic of Yugoslavia at the time, you had Serbia, which was Christian Orthodox, and both of them had police forces that essentially converted into paramilitarized or military forces. And the Bosnian Muslims had far less weaponry and a far less robust security force, and the United States was in this position in the 1990s, coming out of the Afghan war, where the U.S.-backed the mujahideen, where the next front of jihad in the world, and jihad was not a bad word at that time, even in U.S. policy circles. In fact, among some Republicans, it was a very positive word, like Dana Rohrabacher. But the point was that the United States was in this unusual position where they were organizing donor conferences in Turkey and elsewhere to try to raise funds to arm the Bosnian Muslims. And so, at the time, the U.S. position was: This is a good thing that Muslims are coming from around the world to fight in Bosnia against the aggressor Serbs and to a lesser extent, the Croats. So, if you look at it now it’s like “Oh my god Clinton had a secret deal with the Iranians to smuggle weapons in there. but for people to remember, at the time U.S. policy was “this is a good thing to support the Bosnian Muslims in their fight against the Serbs and to a lesser extent the Croats.”</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> That was one of the odd things about doing that story was that the end result was more or less in line with U.S. policy, but the way in which they were doing it with Iran and secretly was — it violated U.S. policy. There was an arms embargo that had been imposed by the United States and by the United Nations.</p>\n<p>And so, it was one of those weird stories, as you’re pointing out, that you have to do the story as a story, as a journalistic exercise, rather than as something that leads to a specific outcome. And, so, you have to remember, as a journalist, you know, you just follow whatever is a good story and not worry ultimately — You can’t really try and determine what the ultimate impact of the story is, you just have to kind of find: What is a good story? What’s important to try to disclose to the American people so they can decide?</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I mean, it’s interesting that this big story that you did fairly early on in your life as national security reporter involved Iran and secret weapons flow, given that the Reagan administration had existed at this time of Iran-Contra where the White House had made secret deals with Iran, was using the proceeds from weapon sales to go to the contras in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> The way I started looking into it was, “OK, is this Bill Clinton’s Iran-Contra?” And it kind of was, in a way, because if you look back at Iran-Contra itself, the end result of Iran-Contra, the objective was to free American hostages, which is not a bad thing. What is it? The road to perdition is paved with good intentions.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Right. And Clinton at the time was getting hammered by the public and the world for not doing enough in Bosnia.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Yes. One of the long-term consequences of this policy, of the secret channel with Iran, was that it increased Iranian influence in Bosnia for a while. And you look back at the war in Bosnia, and one of the long-term consequences was the rise of Islamic radicals in the Balkans. Many of the people who went to fight in the Balkans ended up in Chechnya and then, from Chechnya went to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Well, yeah, and many of them had, prior to that, already been in Afghanistan and it wasn’t just the Iranians, the Saudis and Wahhabi Islam. There are pockets of Bosnia now where you have this intermarrying of very radical Wahhabist Islamic fighters who then marry Bosnian women, and there are enclaves within Bosnia, they call them white Al Qaeda, these areas</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yes, it’s fascinating.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> One of the things I also admire about this story is you don’t pull punches in your own self reflection on some of the stories that you feel that either you got wrong or that you went too far in a direction that resulted in it being unfair. I want you to tell the story of Wen Ho Lee, and for people who don’t know who Wen Ho Lee is, what was the story and what was the criticism of your reporting and how do you view it now?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> In 1999, I think it was, we had heard that there was an espionage case underway at Los Alamos National Laboratory. And so, we investigated and found out that there was a Chinese-American scientist at Los Alamos named Wen Ho Lee who was considered the main suspect in an espionage investigation at the time. And so, we reported that in a series of stories in 1999.</p>\n<p>He was later arrested, and ultimately pled guilty to mishandling of classified information, but the larger espionage case against him collapsed. And the government’s espionage case basically turned out to be incredibly weak and the judge in his case said that the government should be apologizing to him for the way the case was handled.</p>\n<p>A lot of media critics and outside critics thought that we had been way too zealous in our coverage of the case and taken up too pro-government view and too prosecutorial view of the case. And The Times, I think it was in 2000, wrote an editor’s note basically saying that we had, in some cases, been too trusting of government sources I guess or —</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Well, Jim let’s just read from — and you quote this yourself in the piece — you said, “the editor’s note said that we should, ‘have pushed harder to undercover weaknesses in the FBI case against Dr. Lee,’ and that, ‘in place of a tone of journalistic detachment from our sources, we occasionally used language that adopted the sense of alarm that was contained in official reports and was being voiced to us by investigators, members of Congress, and administration officials with knowledge of the case.'” You write, that “in hindsight, I believe that criticism was valid.”</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yes I do. And I think it was — it was a very difficult period from me because I felt really awful about that and about the criticism. Because as anyone who has been criticized widely in public, it’s very difficult to take. But it was, you know, that old line, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” is really true and that experience, it didn’t feel that way at the time, but I’m convinced it made me a better reporter.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I was a young reporter at the time working with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, and I was all about smashing the New York Times and Jim Risen for his propaganda, which is funny now that we work together. We’re going to get into how 9/11 changed your work and your internal fights at the New York Times, your external fights with the U.S. government. But I first want to talk to you about a meeting and an individual that you’ve cited as having an impact on the work that you would do in the future, and that’s the case of John Millis, who was a former CIA officer who then was a staff director on the House Intelligence Committee. Talk about what happened in 2000 when John Millis summoned you to his office.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> John was a good source of mine, and he called me and said, “Come up to my office.” So, I went up in the House Intelligence Committee space and he shut the door, and he said, “I’m going to read you a report.” He said, “Get out your notebook.”</p>\n<p>I said, “Why don’t you just give it to me?” He says, “No, I’m not going to give it to you. I’m going to read it to you, and you take notes.”</p>\n<p>And so, he started reading me this report, and I said, “Slow down, slow down.” And so, he let me write it out verbatim. And it was a classified intelligence CIA report from the inspector general of the CIA about John Deutch, who had been the CIA director, and his mishandling of classified information on computers and how the CIA current leadership under George Tenet hadn’t done enough in their investigation of it, in the IG’s opinion, and had kind of let him off easy.</p>\n<p>And so, I wrote this story based on what Millis, this report. It was a big story at the time and the CIA got all pissed off because it made Tenet look bad, who was then, George Tenet was then the CIA director, because it named him and the people around him for going easy on Deutch.</p>\n<p>And then a few months later, Millis committed suicide. And, I forget exactly how long of a time period between the two events were, but it was just a few months. And, it was weird because I went to the funeral for Millis. I was out at a church in Virginia, and I remember George Tenet was there, and I just thought this is so weird. It was like hundreds of people from the DO were there.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Directorate of Operations, which is a covert action arm, that the operations in question are often covert actions that the United States never officially acknowledges.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> In hindsight, I always thought that must have been one of the last public gatherings of so many DO people before 9/11.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Did you think that his talking to you about these secret affairs played any role in his suicide?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t sure, and it really bothered me whether or not it had played a role. And I, sitting at his funeral, I felt really — just kind of sitting there, I felt — I was wondering what was going on. Because I was sitting there with hundreds of people from the CIA. And, ultimately, I kind of decided it wasn’t related. And for this piece, I talked to his widow, and she told me that she doesn’t think it had anything to do with — his death had anything to do with my story.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> And that’s another part of this sweeping story that you’ve written about your life as a national security reporter, that you interview various colleagues from the New York Times. You sought out Millis’s widow to talk to her. Because it’s the first time that you’re revealing that he was your source. And you talked to his wife about, essentially whether that was OK and what she thought about his death and whether it had any connection to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah, I wanted to ask her if it was OK to mention that he had been a source. He’s been dead for 17 years. She said it was OK, and she thought his death had nothing to do with this.</p>\n<p>It was nice to talk to her about it. It provided some closure for me.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I just want to read another section of this for people and then, Jim, ask you to expand on it. You’re talking about when you first sort of entered the realm of reporting on the CIA and the secrets kept by government officials working for various entities. You write, “I discovered that there was, in effect, a marketplace of secrets in Washington, in which White House officials and other current and former bureaucrats, contractors, members of Congress, their staffers, and journalists, all traded information. This informal black market helped keep the national security apparatus running smoothly.” And then, later, you say: “It felt a bit like being in the matrix.”</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah. I’m sure you know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s weird because it takes a while to get into that world, and you’re not immediately accepted into it just because you’re covering that beat. You really have to prove that you are breaking stories and that you’re, kind of, getting information out that is important.</p>\n<p>And then you begin to find that people are contacting you and are willing to talk to you because they know that the information that they’re providing you will get out. And, it’s just this weird — it’s like joining something without realizing that you’ve joined it. It’s a very strange subculture that. And, once you’re in it, it’s very hard to explain it to other reporters who are doing other beats, like —</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> It’s like the covert Hotel California.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah, yeah! And I began to feel like I had more in common with those people than I did with other reporters off the New York Times or the LA Times who weren’t involved in it.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I came at this sort of a different way from you, Jim. I probably was someone that none of those types of people would have wanted to talk to, but when I started writing about Blackwater, the fact that so many people within the U.S. military and the intelligence community despised Erik Prince and Blackwater, it was sort of an enemy of my enemy was my friend, and people are people. And so, I’m in this bizarre world that you’re describing also, where I also am in contact with people that I think would never talk to me in a different setting, but because there was this common thing that both of us were interested in investigating, it brought us together in a marriage of convenience.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> It’s always a marriage of convenience. I mean, there’s a few people from that world that become friends, but very few. It’s a very dangerous world, because trading secrets, you’ve really got to know what the balance, what the edges of what each specific relationship you have with each person.</p>\n<p>I always found myself, when I would go to a meeting with somebody, I would be thinking: How far can I push this conversation with this specific person based on my past experiences with this person? And it was a very transactional thing that is exhausting in a way.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> You’re also describing a period where there was not this intense crackdown on whistleblowers and prosecutions that happened under Obama. And some of them, of course, including your case started because of reporting you did under Bush.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite vignettes in your story is about a woman who clearly worked in a sensitive position somewhere within the national security apparatus that called you a number of times, and to this day, you still have no idea who that woman is. Explain what happened there.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> It was so weird because back then, I mostly used my landline at the New York Times. And I had a cell phone, but it wasn’t something that I used in the same way I do today. And so, this woman called my landline; she obviously knew my landline number from somewhere. And she just started talking about, “I want to talk to you because I’ve read what you’ve written.”</p>\n<p>And she went into great, incredible detail about certain things that I still don’t feel comfortable describing what it was about because I don’t want anything to lead back to her. And then she just hung up.</p>\n<p>And then a week later, she called again. I was so worried about missing her call, that I was hanging around my desk all the time. And finally, I just said, “Let’s set a time, the same time every week, where you can call me.” And so she agreed to that. And even though I kept trying to get her to give me her name or where she worked or anything, she wouldn’t tell me anything. She was really smart.</p>\n<p>I kind of guessed — I could guess what agency she might be with, but I wasn’t sure. And she just kept calling. And so, once a week, at a very specific time, she would call me. And that went on for several months, and we would have this weird phone relationship where we knew we had this very kind of intimate communication because it was all about top-secret information, but I had no idea who she was. And then, she would abruptly end the call every time. Then, she would call every week at this exact same time. Then finally, she just stopped calling.</p>\n<p>I had no way to reach her. She was very careful about where she called from. And so, to this day, I have no idea who it was.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> That’s really a phenomenal story. I have to admit, it’s not the first time I’ve heard of this tactic used by sources, and so, full disclosure, Jim, I have heard this from other people as well. It’s never been asked of me, but you also had to strip butt naked in order to get information from another source at one point.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> In I guess, it was early 2003, right before the invasion of Iraq. At the time, I don’t know if it’s still true, the U.S. Central Command, it’s forward headquarters was in Qatar. So, Qatar was like, the base for our invasion of Iraq.</p>\n<p>And so, I got this call from a long-time source who told me there’s somebody you should talk to about Qatar and Al Qaeda. And that source introduced me to another source in Europe. And then, that source introduced me to this third person and said, “They’ll meet you in Dubai.” It was a luxury hotel in Dubai.</p>\n<p>And I contacted the person I was supposed to meet, and he told me to go to the steam room and come in totally naked because he was afraid that I would be recording him or that somebody would see us, or that somebody might overhear it.</p>\n<p>And he told me the whole story of how Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been protected and given sanctuary in the 90s by Qatar. And that when the CIA and the FBI found out that he was there, top officials in the Qatar government tipped him off and he fled to Afghanistan, where he started working on the 9/11 plot with Al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>But, it was such a weird experience because I couldn’t take a note book into this meeting. And I couldn’t — he was so frightened by any microphone or anything. So, it was a weird experience.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> It’s like an extreme version of that scene in “All the Presidents Men” about Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate where Bernstein and Woodward are meeting with this woman who is a source and uh, they don’t want to appear to be taking notes. So Bernstein keeps going into the bathroom to write the notes down and reappearing.</p>\n<p>But I think yours is a bit more extreme there, Jim. We’re going to talk about that story, how the New York Times dealt with it internally, and also the U.S. government, but let’s kind of start with a bigger picture. 9/11 happens and it definitely changes the course of your reporting and it ends up very quickly putting you in the crosshairs of the justice department under Bush and then eventually under Obama. Talk about the reporting you were doing in the early stages, post-9/11, and kind of the beat you found yourself on.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> You know, as I said, I’d been covering intelligence for about five, six years before 9/11. And so, I knew everybody. I had a lot of sources at that moment when 9/11 happened. And so, it made it much easier for me to start into the whole Al Qaeda coverage, 9/11 coverage.</p>\n<p>But what began to happen was that the Bush administration began to use 9/11 as a justification for trying to get the press to hold or kill stories. And they began to call the New York Times, all the time, saying, “Don’t write this story. Write this story. Don’t write this story.” And that began to hit me pretty fast.</p>\n<p>One of the first ones after 9/11 that I was working on was we found out, I think it was in 2002, that the CIA had set up a secret prison in Thailand. And it was the first secret prison. And the White House called the Times to kill that story.</p>\n<p>That was my first experience with this whole process that later became such a major full-court press by the Bush administration.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> And just for people to remember, Jim, at the time you learned of this secret site in Thailand, many people will know these as black sites, the program was in its early stages where the CIA and Dick Cheney, the vice president, had a lot of hands-on experience in building this program. They were starting to develop these black sites in a number of countries where they could secretly take prisoners for interrogation, and, in some cases, outright torture. But you had learned of this before it had come out into the public light. What happened when you started trying to report that story in 2002?</p>\n<p><strong>JR: </strong>Well, I called the CIA for comment, and, somebody, I’m not sure, from the White House, called the editors in New York. And I’m a little confused about exactly who, but it was interesting because I know that the story was killed.</p>\n<p>In the 2014, Senate torture report there’s this strange footnote that talks about that, about how the White House, once they found out that — it just says “a major American newspaper found out about this secret site.” It says that Cheney wanted the New York Times to kill it. I don’t know if he personally called, or someone else called, because I think they talked to Gerald Boyd, who’s now dead. But, what it says in the Senate torture report was that was the reason they moved that prison out of Thailand, which I never realized that until I saw the Senate torture report.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So, was the story never ever published, Jim?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I kept pushing for ways to get some of it into the paper. I got a little bit of it into the paper about a year later, but I don’t think anybody noticed. And so, by the time the Washington Post broke the secret prison story, I kind of felt like I had had that story but, I guess you could make the case that I didn’t, so.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> See, what I find amazing about this story and others we’re going to get to in a moment, about what happened to a bunch of your stories at the New York Times, where you have very senior people at the New York Times meeting or speaking to administration officials or intelligence officials, in secret, sometimes with the understanding that they weren’t going to share with you anything about the discussions that they had with government officials, even though you were the reporter on the story.</p>\n<p>And, at the same time, the New York Times was taking information from these, in some cases, very same senior officials, and publishing it as part of the administration’s drive to war in Iraq.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> It’s because of that, that’s why I finally rebelled against the system there and why I published my book, State of War. And why I just — that’s why I finally said, “Enough, I’m not going to keep doing this.”</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> You had numerous stories that were either killed or altered as a result of senior people at the New York Times essentially negotiating with the very people you are supposed to be very vigilantly reporting on and holding accountable. And, eventually, then you get to a point where you say, “I’m not going to play this game anymore.” And so, you can talk about the NSA story and I just want to make sure people understand, you’ve been battling for a sustained period of time against your own editors and the Bush-Cheney administration.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah. So, by 2004, I had gone through this process several times, and I also had stories, before the war in Iraq, about the pre-war intelligence where I talked to people who said that they were skeptical of the intelligence. And those stories had been held or killed or cut.</p>\n<p>So, finally, in 2004, I had this person I was talking to. At some point, the source says to me, “I know what I think is the biggest secret in the government. But I can’t tell you what it is. I am too nervous.” This is like in the spring of 2004. And I said — well, I just made a mental note that I better come back to this guy and try to figure out how to get him to tell me whatever he wants to talk about.</p>\n<p>And so, I arranged to talk to him on a fairly regular basis and finally, in the late summer of 2004, I saw this person, and I said, “You’ve got to tell me now, what the hell are you talking about?” And so, this whole story just spilled out about the NSA Domestic Spying Program, what we now know as Stellar Wind, which is the basis for the whole post-9/11 surveillance of Americans and, in about 10, 15 minutes, he just explained, basically, the whole thing.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> To remind people, this is a decade before Edward Snowden’s revelations.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. It’s basically the outlines of what Snowden later revealed.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> But what I want people to understand here, Jim, that I think is so important about your story is that, in the case of flawed pre-war intelligence in Iraq, warrantless spying, the vacuuming up of Americans’ communications, the vacuuming up of Americans’ banking data — you were aware of these activities a decade before Edward Snowden. And a coalition of very powerful government officials and very powerful senior people at the New York Times suppressed your reporting on these vital issues that could have phenomenally changed the public discourse a decade before Edward Snowden’s name was known by anyone except his immediate family.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah, well that’s pretty much true. We finally got a lot of it out but it took a while. A lot of it was because of, I finally decided to put it in a book because The Times wasn’t publishing the story. That was what happened with the NSA story. I, I was able to confirm with other sources what this guy was telling me about the NSA. And then I was able to, I found another reporter in the Washington Bureau, Eric Lichtblau, who was hearing similar things and we began, we wrote a story that was ready to go right before the election of 2004, between Bush and John Kerry, and the New York Times killed it because The White House asked them not to run it.</p>\n<p>We had these, a lot of arguments at the paper at that moment about it. We had a big meeting in New York over that, I describe in the piece. After the election, Eric and I, got them to agree to let us try again to report it. We re-reported it and re-wrote it, then, they killed it again. And, so I went on book leave and I decided, “I’m going to put everything I know in my book.” And so, I put that story and then another story they’d killed, on a crazy CIA operation in Iran in my book. And, after I’d finished writing the manuscript, I told the editors in the late summer of 2005, “I’m putting these stories in my book. You should publish them.”</p>\n<p>And, then, that began a whole another, several months of very difficult negotiations between me and the New York Times and the New York Times and the Bush administration.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Talk about these meetings that senior New York Times people were having with powerful government officials about your reporting. Tell some of those stories and who the characters are?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> At the time, Bill Keller was the executive editor of the New York Times, and he had made the decision before the election of 2004 not to run the NSA story. And Philip Taubman was the Washington Bureau chief and he had agreed with Keller’s decision.</p>\n<p>After the election, the second time when we had tried to get it, we met just with Taubman, not Keller directly, and Taubman decided we shouldn’t run it, I’m sure with Keller’s consultation.</p>\n<p>And so then, in the fall of 2005, when I told them, “This is all going to be in my book,” everything about the NSA story and the CIA-Iran story, and they should run them, they got furious with me. They were just outraged that I was doing this. And Taubman thought I was being insubordinate. We had some very difficult meetings between him and me.</p>\n<p>And what I didn’t — then, they started having negotiations directly with the Bush administration, Taubman and Keller in particular. And they thought because I was being insubordinate, I couldn’t attend these meetings. And the year before, in 2004, when they were thinking about running it, they’d also had meetings with the government. And there’s one in particular that, right after the election, when we were reconsidering trying to run it in November, December of 2004, when Taubman went with Michael Hayden who then was the head of the National Security Agency, Hayden brought Taubman out to the NSA and actually had to meet with people who were actually directly involved in the domestic spying operation, and had them explain exactly what they were doing.</p>\n<p>And he did it on what he describes as an off-the-record basis and he considered that off-the-record basis to mean he couldn’t tell me and Eric Lichtblau what they told him. And that was a real point of serious contention.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Just so people can follow this, because there’s names and entities, et cetera: Your editor at the New York Times, Phil Taubman, developed this apparently closer relationship or a mutual-based trust relationship with the NSA Director Michael Hayden, and you had your own editor going and meeting with the head of the NSA and being taken on these tours meant to terrify him into not publishing your stories. I mean, it’s, to me, it just seems like a kind of unconscionable crime against journalism to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Well, I agree. You know, that’s what happened. And one of the things I found in doing the reporting for this piece which I hadn’t read before, I read part of Mike Hayden’s memoir that came out last year, which was not high on my reading list before this. But he says in there something fascinating to me.</p>\n<p>There was a meeting that I went to before the election with Taubman. It was Taubman and I, and we met at the White House with John McLaughlin, who was then the acting CIA director, and John Moseman, who was his chief of staff, and they were trying to get us not to run the story. That was the very first meeting than anybody from the New York Times had with the government over this story.</p>\n<p>And what I had never heard before, until I read a small passage in Hayden’s book was he said, “McLaughlin sent me basically a readout of this meeting, in which he said, I think we can work with — Taubman was very respectful and understood the issues and Risen, clearly, all he kept talking about was the public’s right to know, and he didn’t give a shit about what we were saying.”</p>\n<p>And so, Hayden writes in there, “I decided we could work with Taubman.” And so that, to me, made it clear that what was happening ultimately was they were trying to, in the words of, the CIA would call that “case officering,” which means you’re trying to seduce somebody.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Well, and clearly it worked, or at least, it was very effective in delaying publication, and, in some cases, excising parts of your reporting from the published pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah. So, you know, ultimately, I decided the only way the story would ever see the light was to put it in a book. And I realized that would probably mean that I would get fired from the New York Times, and that was the decision I had to make.</p>\n<p>I told my wife, “I’m probably going to get fired for this.” And she said, “Well, if you don’t do it, I won’t respect you. So.”</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I want to back up for one second on something and get your take on this. You describe in this piece, also, some of the reporting that you did about flawed or wrong intelligence in the lead-up to Iraq, that was either not run by the New York Times or was buried inside the pages of the paper. Did you get a sense at the New York Times at the time that there was a support, at high levels, for the drive to war or the narrative that there were in fact, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? I mean, if you look at how Michael Gordon and Judith Miller’s pieces were, you know, multiline headlines, put on the front pages, versus yours being cut or buried?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yes, absolutely. There was no doubt at the time. There was the atmosphere within the paper was: We want stories about the existence of WMD and we don’t want any skeptical stories. And, at the time, the word was that was what the top management wanted. And no one would come out and explicitly say that, either then or now, but I believe that was the case.</p>\n<p>And, I think that was one of the things that I feel bad about is how so many, how people outside the New York Times personified the criticism about it and made it about Judy Miller, rather than as a systemic problem. I believe it was a systemic problem at the paper, and it wasn’t — Judy couldn’t get her stories on page one by herself.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Right, it’s a fair point and I know also in her memoir, she also believes that the fact that she was one of the most prominent female journalists, and the field that you and I are in, Jim, has long been dominated by white straight men.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I say in the piece, I believe that she was the victim of gender bias on that.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> Right, I think that two things can be true at the same time, I agree with you. I mean, Michael Gordon was bylined on lot of those pieces that didn’t get nearly the level of blame for that Judy Miller did, which brings up another issue regarding Judy Miller. She, of course, was the only reporter, correct me if I’m wrong, the only reporter or journalist that actually went to jail for their refusal to give up a source in the Valerie Plame investigation. And, just to remind people, Valerie Plame was a CIA officer who was on non-official cover and was working on the WMD investigation. Her husband, Joe Wilson, was the former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and had gone over to Niger to investigate these reports of yellowcake uranium and then wrote an op-ed about what he didn’t find in Niger. And then, this targeted campaign to smear him was orchestrated very high levels of power within the Bush administration, and then you had Bush officials going around town with a whisper campaign, that was much more audible than most whispers, saying, “Oh, by the way, his wife is an undercover CIA agent, or operative.”</p>\n<p>And Judy Miller was one of the reporters that had heard this. We now know that her source was Scooter Libby — at the time, the senior aide to Dick Cheney. Sorry, for all of that background, I want to make sure people are with us here.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting when you juxtapose this though, and this is what I wanted to ask you about, the way that this case was handled, where you had a retaliatory act committed against an undercover CIA officer, because her husband was blowing the whistle of some of the fraudulent claims being made by the administration. And I think a lot of people on the left were team special prosecutor there, that Judy Miller is on the wrong side of this and we need to know who in government is running around giving up the name of an undercover CIA officer.</p>\n<p>And then, in your case, Jim Risen is being unfairly put into a position by the justice department where they’re trying to force him to give up his source on a story that also cast the Bush administration in a damaging light because of secrets that they were trying to keep about a variety of covert actions. How do you reconcile those two things? Because the Fitzgerald prosecution and the fact that Miller actually went to jail for this is interesting when you then look at your struggle and your battle on the very same issue: I will not give up a source.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah, and I think that the liberal position during the Plame case was a big mistake, because people in Washington were generally looking at the Plame case as a proxy for a debate over the war in Iraq. And what they weren’t looking at it as was a fight over press freedom. And, ultimately, I think the unintended consequence of the Plame case, was that it damaged press freedom in the United States. Because as a special prosecutor, Fitzgerald didn’t have to get approval from the attorney general to subpoena reporters, he could do it on his own. Normally, prosecutors have to go through the attorney general media guidelines to decide whether a case rises to the level of requiring a subpoena of a reporter.</p>\n<p>And so, as a result, Fitzgerald just blew through whatever limitations there had previously been on going after reporters in leak investigations and he basically ended 30 years of informal understanding that had existed between the press and the government over how the government dealt with leak cases.</p>\n<p>And so, I think that the unattended consequence of forcing not just Judy, but a lot of other people into the situation, was ultimately led to what happened with me and other cases since then. It convinced the government that they could go ahead and go after reporters and go after sources and that there would be no real political backlash. And I think that was a major legacy of the Plame case which no one saw at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I do think you are right. And again, two things can be true at the same time. You can, on the one hand, find it risible or despicable that reporters would play along with this kind of a campaign from the vice president and his minions, and probably others, and think that’s awful, and at the same time say, “wait a minute, we’re going to set up very dangerous precedent here if we believe that reporters under any circumstances should be forced to give up their sources.”</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> That’s exactly what happened. And I think no one thought very clearly about that at the time. And Judy Miller was a very controversial figure by that point, because of the WMD coverage. And so, it was difficult for very many liberals to get behind supporting her publicly. And no one wanted to support the Bush administration and the White House, in their effort to hide what really had to happen in the leak on Plame. But, ultimately, Fitzgerald used that political support I think he had, to just bulldoze whatever informal understandings we had and they’re now gone.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So, for people that didn’t follow this, explain what was happening to you under the Obama administration, the Justice Department at the time, and why you were at risk of potentially going to jail?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> The New York Times finally ran the NSA story in December 2005 after I told them it was going to be in my book. You know, we had these long meetings that I described. And finally, they ran it.</p>\n<p>Then, my book, “State of War,” came out in early January of 2006. And one of the stories that had been held by the New York Times that I had put into that was another story, it was about a secret, crazy, screwed up CIA operation involved Iran and its nuclear program and the New York Times had never run that, even though they ran the NSA one. I told them it was going to be in my book but they never got around to considering running it.</p>\n<p>I believe what happened was that the Bush administration started two leak investigations: One of the NSA story in the New York Times and a second one about my book, and things that were in “State of War.” And I know that they had FBI agents talking to people about several different chapters that were in my book that were not in the New York Times, and I believe what they were doing was looking for something they could get on me separate from the New York Times.</p>\n<p>And, finally, they decided on the chapter about the CIA-Iran story. And they dropped the investigation of the NSA story in the New York Times. What I believe is that the NSA story was what really angered them, but that they didn’t want to take on the New York Times in a constitutional showdown over the publication of it.</p>\n<p>And so, I think they were looking for something where they could isolate me. And I’ve had a lot of evidence to support that over the years from various people.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2007, we got a FedEx letter from the Justice Department saying, “We want to talk to you. We want all your information about your sources on this chapter.” And, so, I got some lawyers involved and began to negotiate with the Bush administration. And, finally, I refused to provide them any information, and in January 2008, they subpoenaed me to testify before a grand jury looking into that leak, and I refused to cooperate.</p>\n<p>And, the judge, who in this case, Judge Brinkema in the eastern district of Virginia, the federal district court, I think she recognized that that was an election year and let the clock play out through a lot of procedural motions that took a long time. I think she figured, if Obama wins, he’s going to drop this case. And, so, Obama won and I thought, yeah, Obama is going to drop this case.</p>\n<p>Then in July, I think was June or July of 2009, the judge issued a very brief memo that said, “I see that the grand jury, in this case, has now expired because it’s been so long. That means that the subpoena is now moot and I give the government 10 days to decide whether to drop this or not.” And I thought, “OK, that’s the end of this case.” And I think it was a written invitation from the judge to the Obama administration to drop this case very quietly and let it go.</p>\n<p>And instead, Eric Holder and the new Justice Department said, “No, no, no, no, we want to keep this case going.” They issued a new subpoena to me. That was my first taste of how the Obama administration was going to continue the post-9/11 world just pretty much the way Bush had been doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> This battle that the Obama Justice Department was waging against you in and of itself became a media circus where you had once been the print journalist who watches the huge pile-up of camera people chasing someone, and then you had to witness that in your own case from either side.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah. It was bizarre to become a subject of the press. It’s actually a very humbling experience because I think it’s actually good for every journalist to be the subject of a story once, it makes you realize how flawed we are as reporters. But, yeah, it was weird because finally, for the most part, except for a few print reporters, media reporters, the press ignored my case until 2014 when it went to the Supreme Court. And when the Supreme Court finally had to decide whether to take the case, that’s when it finally started getting a lot of attention.</p>\n<p>And when the Supreme Court refused to take the case, that meant that I was either going to have to testify or go to jail. And I refused to testify and there were no more legal options available and so then the pressure began to build on Eric Holder and the Justice Department of whether they really were going to send me to jail or not.</p>\n<p>Finally, in early 2015, they caved and decided not to. They had a pre-trial hearing, where they forced me to come in and say in person whether I was going to testify or not. And I told them, “No.” Then they said, “OK, that’s it.” And then they blinked at the last minute.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I would also encourage people to go back and listen to the first appearance of Jim Risen on Intercepted where we talk in-depth about that case. Jim, final thoughts here from you on the battle of reporters versus the government on this issue of secrecy. I’ve been recently re-reading some of the history of Nixon’s ideas on how to go after people like Seymour Hersh. You’ve had battles going back to the Progressive Magazine, publishing documents on making a hydrogen bomb. There have been huge battles over national security and government secrets between journalists and those in power. And it’s not Democrat or Republican; it’s those in power, whoever they may be.</p>\n<p>Your thoughts, though, about where we are and where we’ve been, this fight for a truly independent press that believes in holding those in power accountable.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I think the post-9/11 world has been very difficult for that. And I think the press has been far too deferential since 9/11 to the government, and it’s made the government realize they can use the word “terrorism” or “national security threat” for almost anything. And it’s made the press much more docile, and I think that is something that has to be fought back against.</p>\n<p>I think the New York Times has gotten a little better about it since my case. I think the NSA story and my whole experience on that helped force them to get all better about it. But, generally, the press is still way too deferential and is so cowed by the perceived and supposed threats from terrorism that they are willing to go along with the government in ways that I don’t think they should. Part of it’s also because of the financial condition of the press.</p>\n<p>They’re so weakened, they’re so fragmented now, that there’s no great role models in the press anymore that everybody will follow. Individual reporters have to be willing to stand up themselves because institutions today are, generally, too weak to do it. And so, it really comes down to, as a reporter, stand up for your own story. If you do, you’ll ultimately be proven right.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> I would just add Jim that I think it’s also incumbent upon all of us as journalists to stand up when any journalist is put through the ordeal that you were. Because it’s very shortsighted to just say, “Well, I’ll be there when my friends or the people that I agree with are in the target sights of the powerful.”</p>\n<p>Jim Risen, thank you very much for all the work that you’ve done and for this incredible piece at theintercept.com.

        "content": "<p>I was sitting in the nearly empty restaurant of the Westin Hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, getting ready for a showdown with the federal government that I had been trying to avoid for more than seven years. The Obama administration was demanding that I reveal the confidential sources I had relied on for a chapter about a botched CIA operation in my 2006 book, “State of War.” I had also written about the CIA operation for the New York Times, but the paper’s editors had suppressed the story at the government’s request. It wasn’t the only time they had done so.</p>\n<h3><span>1<br>\nA Marketplace of Secrets</span><span> </span></h3>\n<p><u>Bundled against the</u> freezing wind, my lawyers and I were about to reach the courthouse door when two news photographers launched into a perp-walk shoot. As a reporter, I had witnessed this classic scene dozens of times, watching in bemusement from the sidelines while frenetic photographers and TV crews did their business. I never thought I would be the perp, facing those whirring cameras.</p>\n<p>As I walked past the photographers into the courthouse that morning in January 2015, I saw a group of reporters, some of whom I knew personally. They were here to cover my case, and now they were waiting and watching me. I felt isolated and alone.</p>\n<p>My lawyers and I took over a cramped conference room just outside the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, where we waited for her to begin the pretrial hearing that would determine my fate. My lawyers had been working with me on this case for so many years that they now felt more like friends. We often engaged in gallows humor about what it was going to be like for me once I went to jail. But they had used all their skills to make sure that didn’t happen and had even managed to keep me out of a courtroom and away from any questioning by federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Until now.</p>\n<p>My case was part of a broader crackdown on reporters and whistleblowers that had begun during the presidency of George W. Bush and continued far more aggressively under the Obama administration, which had already prosecuted more leak cases than all previous administrations combined. Obama officials seemed determined to use criminal leak investigations to limit reporting on national security. But the crackdown on leaks only applied to low-level dissenters; top officials caught up in leak investigations, like former CIA Director David Petraeus, were still treated with kid gloves.</p>\n<p>Initially, I had succeeded in the courts, surprising many legal experts. In the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Brinkema had sided with me when the government repeatedly subpoenaed me to testify before a grand jury. She had ruled in my favor again by quashing a trial subpoena in the case of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who the government accused of being a source for the story about the ill-fated CIA operation. In her rulings, Brinkema determined that there was a “reporter’s privilege” — at least a limited one — under the First Amendment that gave journalists the right to protect their sources, much as clients and patients can shield their private communications with lawyers and doctors.</p>\n<p>But the Obama administration appealed her 2011 ruling quashing the trial subpoena, and in 2013, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a split decision, sided with the administration, ruling that there was no such thing as a reporter’s privilege. In 2014, the Supreme Court refused to hear my appeal, allowing the 4th Circuit ruling to stand. Now there was nothing legally stopping the Justice Department from forcing me to either reveal my sources or be jailed for contempt of court.</p>\n<p>But even as I was losing in the courts, I was gaining ground in the court of public opinion. My decision to go to the Supreme Court had captured the attention of the nation’s political and media classes. Instead of ignoring the case, as they had for years, the national media now framed it as a major constitutional battle over press freedom.</p>\n<p>That morning in Alexandria, my lawyers and I learned that the prosecutors were frustrated by my writing style. In “<a href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/State-of-War/James-Risen/9780743270670\">State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration</a>,” I didn’t include attribution for many passages. I didn’t explicitly say where I was getting my information, and I didn’t identify what information was classified and what wasn’t. That had been a conscious decision; I didn’t want to interrupt the narrative flow of the book with phrases explaining how I knew each fact, and I didn’t want to explicitly say how I had obtained so much sensitive information. If prosecutors couldn’t point to specific passages to prove I had relied on confidential sources who gave me classified information, their criminal case against Sterling might fall apart.</p>\n<p>When I walked into the courtroom that morning, I thought the prosecutors might demand that I publicly identify specific passages in my book where I had relied on classified information and confidential sources. If I didn’t comply, they could ask the judge to hold me in contempt and send me to jail.</p>\n<p>I was worried, but I felt certain that the hearing would somehow complete the long, strange arc I had been living as a national security investigative reporter for the past 20 years. As I took the stand, I thought about how I had ended up here, how much press freedom had been lost, and how drastically the job of national security reporting had changed in the post-9/11 era.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/grid-1-1514575074.jpg\"><img alt=\"CIA Director George Tenet, right, accompanied by Attorney General John Ashcroft, looks on as FBI Director Louis Freeh, not shown, meets reporters at FBI headquarters in Washington Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2001 to discuss the arrest the FBI Agent Robert Philip Hanssen.

Millis, John Deutch, Wen Ho Lee.</p>\n<p>Photo: AP, Getty Images</p></div><u>There’s no press room</u> at CIA headquarters, like there is at the White House. The agency doesn’t hand out press passes that let reporters walk the halls, the way they do at the Pentagon. It doesn’t hold regular press briefings, as the State Department has under most administrations. The one advantage that reporters covering the CIA have is time. Compared to other major beats in Washington, the CIA generates relatively few daily stories. You have more time to dig, more time to meet people and develop sources.\n<p>I started covering the CIA in 1995. The Cold War was over, the CIA was downsizing, and CIA officer Aldrich Ames had just been unmasked as a Russian spy. A whole generation of senior CIA officials was leaving Langley. Many wanted to talk.</p>\n<p>I was the first reporter many of them had ever met. As they emerged from their insular lives at the CIA, they had little concept of what information would be considered newsworthy. So I decided to show more patience with sources than I ever had before. I had to learn to listen and let them talk about whatever interested them. They had fascinating stories to tell.</p>\n<p>In addition to their experiences in spy operations, many had been involved in providing intelligence support at presidential summit meetings, treaty negotiations, and other official international conferences. I realized that these former CIA officers had been backstage at some of the most historic events over the last few decades and thus had a unique and hidden perspective on what had happened behind the scenes in American foreign policy. I began to think of these CIA officers like the title characters in Tom Stoppard’s play “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” in which Stoppard reimagines “Hamlet” from the viewpoint of two minor characters who fatalistically watch Shakespeare’s play from the wings.</p>\n<p>While covering the CIA for the Los Angeles Times and later the New York Times, I found that patiently listening to my sources paid off in unexpected ways. During one interview, a source was droning on about a minor bureaucratic battle inside the CIA when he briefly referred to how then-President Bill Clinton had secretly given the green light to Iran to covertly ship arms to Bosnian Muslims during the Balkan wars. The man had already resumed talking about his bureaucratic turf war when I realized what he had just said and interrupted him, demanding that he go back to Iran. That led me to write <a href=\"http://tech.mit.edu/V116/N17/clinton.17w.html\">a series of stories</a> that prompted the House of Representatives to create a special select committee to investigate the covert Iran-Bosnia arms pipeline. Another source surprised me by volunteering a copy of the CIA’s secret history of the agency’s involvement in the 1953 coup in Iran. Up until then, the CIA had insisted that many of the agency’s internal documents from the coup had long since been lost or destroyed.</p>\n<p>But one incident left me questioning whether I should continue as a national security reporter. In 2000, John Millis, a former CIA officer who had become staff director of the House Intelligence Committee, summoned me to his small office on Capitol Hill. After he closed the door, he took out a classified report by the CIA’s inspector general and read it aloud, slowly, as I sat next to him. He repeated passages when I asked, allowing me to transcribe the report verbatim. The report concluded that top CIA officials had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/01/us/cia-inquiry-of-its-ex-director-was-stalled-at-top-report-says.html\">impeded an internal investigation</a> into evidence that former CIA Director John Deutch had mishandled large volumes of classified material, placing it on personal computers in his home.</p>\n<p>The story was explosive, and it angered top CIA officials.</p>\n<p>Several months later, Millis killed himself. His death shook me badly. I didn’t believe that my story had played a role, but as I watched a crowd of current and former CIA officials stream into the church in suburban Virginia where his funeral was held, I wondered whether I was caught up in a game that was turning deadly. (I have never before disclosed that Millis was the source for the Deutch story, but his death more than 17 years ago makes me believe there is no longer any purpose to keeping his identity a secret. In an interview for this story, Millis’s widow, Linda Millis, agreed that there was no reason to continue hiding his role as my source, adding: “I don’t believe there is any evidence that [leaking the Deutch report] had anything to do with John’s death.”)</p>\n<p>Another painful but important lesson came from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/06/world/breach-los-alamos-special-report-china-stole-nuclear-secrets-for-bombs-us-aides.html\">my coverage of the case of Wen Ho Lee</a>, a Chinese-American scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who in 1999 was suspected by the government of spying for China. After the government’s espionage case against him collapsed, I was heavily criticized — including in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/26/us/from-the-editors-the-times-and-wen-ho-lee.html\">an editor’s note</a> in the New York Times — for having written stories that lacked sufficient caveats about flaws and holes in the government’s case. The editor’s note said that we should “have pushed harder to uncover weaknesses in the FBI case against Dr. Lee,” and that “in place of a tone of journalistic detachment from our sources, we occasionally used language that adopted the sense of alarm that was contained in official reports and was being voiced to us by investigators, members of Congress and administration officials with knowledge of the case.”</p>\n<p>In hindsight, I believe the criticism was valid.</p>\n<p>That bitter experience almost led me to leave the Times. Instead, I decided to stay. In the end, it made me much more skeptical of the government.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/AP_01022001609-1-1514575031.jpg\"><img alt=\"CIA Director George Tenet, right, accompanied by Attorney General John Ashcroft, looks on as FBI Director Louis Freeh, not shown, meets reporters at FBI headquarters in Washington Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2001 to discuss the arrest the FBI Agent Robert Philip Hanssen.

This informal black market helped keep the national security apparatus running smoothly, limiting nasty surprises for all involved. The revelation that this secretive subculture existed, and that it allowed a reporter to glimpse the government’s dark side, was jarring. It felt a bit like being in the Matrix.</p>\n<p>Once it became known that you were covering this shadowy world, sources would sometimes appear in mysterious ways. In one case, I received an anonymous phone call from someone with highly sensitive information who had read other stories I had written. The information from this new source was very detailed and valuable, but the person refused to reveal her identity and simply said she would call back. The source called back several days later with even more information, and after several calls, I was able to convince her to call at a regular time so I would be prepared to talk. For the next few months, she called once every week at the exact same time and always with new information. Because I didn’t know who the source was, I had to be cautious with the information and never used any of it in stories unless I could corroborate it with other sources. But everything the source told me checked out. Then after a few months, she abruptly stopped calling. I never heard from her again, and I never learned her identity.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">A top CIA official once told me that his rule of thumb for whether a covert operation should be approved was, “How will this look on the front page of the New York Times?”</blockquote>\n<p>Disclosures of confidential information to the press were generally tolerated as facts of life in this secret subculture. The media acted as a safety valve, letting insiders vent by leaking. The smartest officials realized that leaks to the press often helped them, bringing fresh eyes to stale internal debates. And the fact that the press was there, waiting for leaks, lent some discipline to the system. A top CIA official once told me that his rule of thumb for whether a covert operation should be approved was, “How will this look on the front page of the New York Times?” If it would look bad, don’t do it. Of course, his rule of thumb was often ignored.</p>\n<p>For decades, official Washington did next to nothing to stop leaks. The CIA or some other agency would feign outrage over the publication of a story it didn’t like. Officials launched leak investigations but only went through the motions before abandoning each case. It was a charade that both government officials and reporters understood.</p>\n<p>As part of my legal case, my lawyers filed Freedom of Information Act requests with several government agencies seeking documents those agencies had about me. All the agencies refused to provide any documents related to my current leak case, but eventually the FBI began to turn over reams of documents about old leak investigations that had been conducted years earlier on other stories I had written. I was stunned to learn of them.</p>\n<p>The documents revealed that the FBI gave code names to its leak investigations. One set of documents identified an investigation code-named “BRAIN STORM”; another, code-named “SERIOUS MONEY,” involved <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/06/world/struggle-for-iraq-diplomacy-iraq-said-have-tried-reach-last-minute-deal-avert.html\">a story I did in 2003</a> about how the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein had tried to reach a secret, last-minute deal with the Bush administration to avoid war. Yet the government had closed all these leak investigations without taking action against my sources or me, at least as far as I know.</p>\n<p>Even after 9/11, government officials had a limited appetite for aggressively pursuing leak cases, and Justice Department and FBI officials had little interest in getting assigned to leak investigations. They knew they were dead-end cases. A June 19, 2003, FBI memo about BRAIN STORM shows it shared the fate of virtually all leak investigations of that era. The FBI’s Washington field office “has covered all logical leads, and no viable suspect has been identified,” the memo noted. “Based upon this situation, WFO is referring this matter back to FBIHQ for additional input and/or presenting this case to DOJ for closure.”</p>\n<p>One reason that officials didn’t want to conduct aggressive leak investigations was that they regularly engaged in quiet negotiations with the press to try to stop the publication of sensitive national security stories. Government officials seemed to understand that a get-tough approach to leaks might lead to the breakdown of this informal arrangement.</p>\n<p>At the time, I usually went along with these negotiations. About a year before 9/11, for instance, I learned that the CIA had sent case officers to Afghanistan to meet with Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the rebel Northern Alliance, which was fighting the Taliban government. The CIA officers had been sent to try to convince Massoud to help the Americans go after Osama bin Laden, who was then living in Afghanistan under the Taliban’s protection.</p>\n<p>When I called the CIA for comment, then-CIA Director George Tenet called me back personally to ask me not to run the story. He told me the disclosure would threaten the safety of the CIA officers in Afghanistan. I agreed.</p>\n<p>I finally wrote <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/world/nation-challenged-intelligence-us-pursued-secret-efforts-catch-kill-bin-laden.html\">the story</a> after 9/11, but I later wondered whether it had been a mistake to hold it before the attacks on New York City and Washington. Independent investigations of 9/11 later concluded that the CIA’s effort to target bin Laden before the attacks had been half-hearted. If I had reported the story before 9/11, the CIA would have been angry, but it might have led to a public debate about whether the United States was doing enough to capture or kill bin Laden. That public debate might have forced the CIA to take the effort to get bin Laden more seriously.</p>\n<p>My experience with that story and subsequent ones made me much less willing to go along with later government requests to hold or kill stories. And that ultimately set me on a collision course with the editors at the New York Times, who were still quite willing to cooperate with the government.</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/1859095-bw-1-1514575020.jpg\"><img alt=\"1859095-bw-1-1514575020\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/1859095-bw-1-1514575020.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164362\"></a></p>\n<p>President George W. Bush addresses the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 19, 2003, announcing U.S. military airstrikes in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images</p></div>\n<h3><span>2<br>\nYOU FURNISH THE PICTURES, I’LL FURNISH THE WAR</span><span> </span></h3>\n<p><u>After the 9/11 attacks,</u> the Bush administration began asking the press to kill stories more frequently. They did it so often that I became convinced the administration was invoking national security to quash stories that were merely politically embarrassing. In late 2002, for instance, I called the CIA for comment on a story about the existence of a secret CIA prison in Thailand that had just been created to house Al Qaeda detainees, including Abu Zubaydah. In response, Bush administration officials called the Times and got the paper to kill the story. I disagreed with the paper’s decision because I believed that the White House was just trying to cover up the fact that the CIA had begun to set up secret prisons. I finally reported the information a year later. (In 2014, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ECs8C2VpuV0C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=In+November+2002,+after+the+CIA+learned+that+a+major+U.S.+newspaper+knew+that+Abu+Zubaydah&source=bl&ots=zhZ2YI6C7U&sig=BLHfHR6TZUbmyQAzLk2x5HGqomU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDsYingpTY\">report on the CIA’s torture program</a> provided new insight into the consequences of the killed Thailand story. “In November 2002, after the CIA learned that a major U.S. newspaper knew that Abu Zubaydah was in Country [redacted], senior CIA officials, as well as Vice President Cheney, urged the newspaper not to publish the information,” the 2014 report states. “While the U.S. newspaper did not reveal Country [redacted] as the location of Abu Zubaydah, the fact that it had the information, combined with previous media interest, resulted in the decision to close Detention Site Green.”)</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">My stories raising questions about the administration’s claims of a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda were being cut, buried, or held out of the paper altogether.</blockquote>\n<p>By 2002, I was also starting to clash with the editors over our coverage of the Bush administration’s claims about pre-war intelligence on Iraq. My stories raising questions about the intelligence, particularly the administration’s claims of a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, were being cut, buried, or held out of the paper altogether.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/21/international/prague-discounts-an-iraqi-meeting.html\">One of the few stories</a> I managed to get on the front page cast doubt on reports that an Iraqi intelligence officer had met with 9/11 plotter Mohamed Atta in Prague before the attacks on New York and Washington. But Doug Frantz, then the investigations editor in New York, felt that he had to sneak it onto Page 1. “Given the atmosphere among the senior editors at The Times, I was concerned that the story would not make it to page 1 on a day when everyone was convened around the table,” Frantz emailed me recently. “So I decided that it was too important to appear inside the paper and went ahead and offered it on a Sunday, a day when the senior editors weren’t often involved in the discussion.”</p>\n<p>Then-Executive Editor Howell Raines was believed by many at the paper to prefer stories that supported the case for war. But Raines now says he was not pro-war, and that he did not object to putting my Prague story on the front page. “I never told anyone at any level on the Times that I wanted stories that supported the war,” he told me in an email.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Judy Miller, an intense reporter who was based in New York but had sources at the highest levels of the Bush administration, was writing story after story that seemed to document the existence of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Her stories were helping to set the political agenda in Washington.</p>\n<p>Miller and I were friends — in fact, I was probably one of her closest friends in the Washington bureau at the time. In the year before 9/11, Miller worked on a remarkable series of stories about Al Qaeda that offered clear warnings about its new power and intent. In the months after 9/11, she and I both scrambled to document Al Qaeda’s role in the attacks and the counterterrorism response by the United States. We were both part of a team that won the <a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-53\">2002 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting</a> for our coverage of terrorism and 9/11.</p>\n<p>But in the months leading up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, while Miller and other Times reporters were landing a string of big stories that dazzled the editors, I was getting frustrated that so few of my sources in the intelligence community were willing to talk to me about what they thought of the Bush administration’s case for war. I kept hearing quiet complaints that the White House was pressuring CIA analysts to cook the books and deliver intelligence reports that followed the party line on Iraq. But when I pressed, few were willing to provide specifics. Intermediaries would sometimes tell me that they were receiving anguished calls from CIA analysts, but when I asked to talk to them, they refused.</p>\n<p>After weeks of reporting in late 2002 and early 2003, I was able to get enough material to start writing stories that revealed that intelligence analysts were skeptical of the Bush administration’s evidence for going to war, particularly the administration’s assertions that there were links between Saddam’s regime and Al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>But after I filed the first story, it sat in the Times computer system for days, then weeks, untouched by editors. I asked several editors about the story’s status, but no one knew.</p>\n<p>Finally, the story ran, but it was badly cut and buried deep inside the paper. I wrote another one, and the same thing happened. I tried to write more, but I started to get the message. It seemed to me that the Times didn’t want these stories.</p>\n<p>What angered me most was that while they were burying my skeptical stories, the editors were not only giving banner headlines to stories asserting that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, they were also demanding that I help match stories from other publications about Iraq’s purported WMD programs. I grew so sick of this that when the Washington Post reported that Iraq had turned over nerve gas to terrorists, I refused to try to match the story. One mid-level editor in the Washington bureau yelled at me for my refusal. He came to my desk carrying a golf club while berating me after I told him that the story was bullshit and I wasn’t going to make any calls on it.</p>\n<p>As a small protest, I put a sign on my desk that said, “You furnish the pictures, I’ll furnish the war.” It was New York Journal publisher William Randolph Hearst’s supposed line to artist Frederic Remington, whom he had sent to Cuba to illustrate the “crisis” there before the Spanish-American War. I don’t think my editors even noticed the sign.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-109110294-1-1514575051.jpg\"><img alt=\"CIA Director George Tenet, right, accompanied by Attorney General John Ashcroft, looks on as FBI Director Louis Freeh, not shown, meets reporters at FBI headquarters in Washington Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2001 to discuss the arrest the FBI Agent Robert Philip Hanssen.

It had taken weeks of negotiations, through a series of intermediaries, to arrange our meeting. We agreed on a luxury hotel in Dubai, the modern capital of Middle Eastern intrigue.</p>\n<p>Just before we were scheduled to meet, however, the source imposed new demands. We would have to talk in the hotel’s steam room, naked. He wanted to make sure he wasn’t being recorded. That also made it impossible for me to take notes until after our meeting.</p>\n<p>But it was worth it. He told me the story of how Qatar had given sanctuary to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in the 1990s, when he was wanted in connection with a plot to blow up American airliners. Qatari officials had given KSM a government job and then had apparently warned him when the FBI and CIA were closing in, allowing him to escape to Afghanistan, where he joined forces with bin Laden and became the mastermind behind the 9/11 plot.</p>\n<p>I was later able to confirm the story, which was especially significant because Qatar was home to the forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command, the military command in charge of the invasion of Iraq.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/08/world/threats-responses-counterterrorism-qaeda-aide-slipped-away-long-before-sept-11.html\">After the story ran</a>, I felt revitalized.</p>\n<p>That spring, just as the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq began, I called the CIA for comment on a story about a harebrained CIA operation to turn over nuclear blueprints to Iran. The idea was that the CIA would give the Iranians flawed blueprints, and Tehran would use them to build a bomb that would turn out to be a dud.</p>\n<p>The problem was with the execution of the secret plan. The CIA had taken Russian nuclear blueprints it had obtained from a defector and then had American scientists riddle them with flaws. The CIA then asked another Russian to approach the Iranians. He was supposed to pretend to be trying to sell the documents to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p>But the design flaws in the blueprints were obvious. The Russian who was supposed to hand them over feared that the Iranians would quickly recognize the errors, and that he would be in trouble. To protect himself when he dropped off the documents at an Iranian mission in Vienna, he included a letter warning that the designs had problems. So the Iranians received the nuclear blueprints and were also warned to look for the embedded flaws.</p>\n<p>Several CIA officials believed that the operation had either been mismanaged or at least failed to achieve its goals. By May 2003, I confirmed the story through a number of sources, wrote up a draft, and called the CIA public affairs office for comment.</p>\n<p>Instead of responding to me, the White House immediately called Washington Bureau Chief Jill Abramson and demanded a meeting.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Condoleezza Rice stared straight at me. I had received information so sensitive that I had an obligation to forget about the story, she said.</blockquote>\n<p>The next day, Abramson and I went to the West Wing of the White House to meet with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. In her office, just down the hall from the Oval Office, we sat across from Rice and George Tenet, the CIA director, along with two of their aides.</p>\n<p>Rice stared straight at me. I had received information so sensitive that I had an obligation to forget about the story, destroy my notes, and never make another phone call to discuss the matter with anyone, she said. She told Abramson and me that the New York Times should never publish the story.</p>\n<p>I tried to turn the tables. I asked Tenet a few questions about the Iranian program and got him to confirm the story, and also provide some details I hadn’t heard before. The only point he disputed was that the operation had been mismanaged.</p>\n<p>Rice argued that the operation was an alternative to a full-scale invasion of Iran, like the war that President George W. Bush had just launched in Iraq. “You criticize us for going to war for weapons of mass destruction,” I recall her saying. “Well, this is what we can do instead.” (Years later, when Rice testified in the Sterling trial, a copy of the “talking points” she had prepared for our meeting was entered into evidence, though I don’t remember her actually saying many of these things.)</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=164558\"></div>\n\n<p>Abramson told Rice and Tenet that the decision on whether to run the story was up to Times Executive Editor Howell Raines. After the meeting, Abramson and I stopped for lunch. We were both stunned by the full-court press we had just endured. But I also recognized that I had just gotten high-level confirmation for the story — better confirmation than I could ever have imagined.</p>\n<p>Just after Abramson and I met with Tenet and Rice, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/us/correcting-the-record-times-reporter-who-resigned-leaves-long-trail-of-deception.html\">the Jayson Blair scandal</a> erupted, forcing Raines into an intense battle to save his job. Blair may have been the immediate cause of the crisis, but among the staff at the Times, Blair was merely the trigger that allowed resentment that had built up against Raines over his management style to come out into the open.</p>\n<p>Abramson recalls that after our meeting with Rice, she took the Iran story to both Raines and then-Managing Editor Gerald Boyd. “They gave me a swift no” about publishing the story, Abramson told me recently. She said that she told Raines and Boyd that Rice was willing to discuss the story with them on a secure phone line that they could use from a facility on Manhattan’s East Side, but she says they never asked to take that step, and she didn’t push them to do so. Raines disputes this. “I was not informed of this meeting [with Rice and Tenet], nor do I recall being involved with your story in any way,” he said in an email. (Boyd died in 2006.)</p>\n<p>Raines left the paper in early June 2003. Joe Lelyveld, the retired executive editor, briefly came back to run the Times on an interim basis. I talked to him by phone about the Iran story, but he didn’t really have time to deal with it.</p>\n<p>When Bill Keller was named executive editor in the summer of 2003, he agreed to discuss the story with Abramson and me. Abramson, meanwhile, had been promoted to managing editor, Keller’s No. 2. After I went over the story with him, Keller decided not to publish it. I tried over the next year to get him to change his mind, but I couldn’t.</p>\n<p>The spiking of the Iran story, coming so soon after the internal fights over WMD coverage, left me depressed. I began to think about whether to write a book that would include the Iran story and document the war on terror more broadly in a way I didn’t believe I had been able to do in the Times.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/56025985-bw-1-1514575025.jpg\"><img alt=\"56025985-bw-1-1514575025\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/56025985-bw-1-1514575025.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164363\"></a>\n<p>U.S. federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on Oct. 28, 2005, in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</p></div><u>The Bush administration</u> was successfully convincing the press to hold or kill national security stories, but the government had not yet launched an aggressive campaign to hunt down whistleblowers and target reporters. That all changed with the Valerie Plame case.\n<p>In December 2003, the Justice Department appointed Patrick Fitzgerald, then the U.S. attorney in Chicago, to be a special counsel to investigate allegations that top Bush White House officials had illegally leaked Plame’s covert identity as a CIA officer. Critics claimed that the Bush White House had sold her out to the press as retribution against her Iraq war critic husband, former U.S. diplomat Joseph Wilson.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Anti-Bush liberals saw the Valerie Plame case and leak investigation as a proxy fight over the war in Iraq, rather than as a potential threat to press freedom.</blockquote>\n<p>Without thinking about the long-term consequences, many in the media cheered Fitzgerald on, urging him to aggressively go after top Bush administration officials to find out who was the source of the leak. Anti-Bush liberals saw the Plame case and the Fitzgerald leak investigation as a proxy fight over the war in Iraq, rather than as a potential threat to press freedom.</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald, an Inspector Javert-like prosecutor whose special counsel status meant that no one at the Justice Department could rein him in, started subpoenaing reporters all over Washington and demanding they testify before a grand jury.</p>\n<p>There was hardly a murmur of dissent from liberals as Fitzgerald pressed one prominent reporter after another for information. Only Judy Miller went to jail rather than cooperate. (She eventually testified after she received a waiver from her source, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney.)</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald became famous as a tough, no-nonsense prosecutor, and the fact that he had run roughshod over the Washington press corps didn’t hurt his reputation. He went on to become a partner in one of America’s premier law firms.</p>\n<p>The Plame case eventually faded away, but it had set a dangerous precedent. Fitzgerald had successfully subpoenaed reporters and forced them to testify and in the process, had become the Justice Department’s biggest star. He had demolished the political, social, and legal constraints that previously made government officials reluctant to go after journalists and their sources. He became a role model for career prosecutors, who saw that you could rise to the top of the Justice Department by going after reporters and their sources.</p>\n<p>White House officials, meanwhile, saw that there wasn’t as much political blowback from targeting reporters and conducting aggressive leak investigations as they had expected. The decadesold informal understanding between the government and the press — that the government would only go through the motions on leak investigations — was dead.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-57555456-bw-1-1514575045.jpg\"><img alt=\"GettyImages-57555456-bw-1-1514575045\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-57555456-bw-1-1514575045.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164367\"></a>\n<p>Michael Hayden, nominated to be the new CIA director, looks on during a personnel announcement on May 8, 2006, in the Oval Office of the White House.</p>\n<p>Photo: Roger Wollenberg-Pool/Getty Images</p></div>\n<h3><span>3<br>\nStellar Wind</span><span> </span></h3>\n<p><u>In the summer</u> of 2003, the New York Times named a new Washington bureau chief: Philip Taubman, an old friend of Bill Keller’s. Taubman had been the Times’s Moscow bureau chief when Keller won a Pulitzer Prize as a correspondent there. Now Taubman was Keller’s man in Washington.</p>\n<p>Taubman and I developed a friendly relationship. He had covered national security and intelligence matters earlier in his career, and he seemed eager for scoops. But by 2004, I began to disagree with some of his decisions. That spring, I learned that the Bush administration had discovered that Ahmad Chalabi, the neoconservatives’ golden boy in Iraq, had told an Iranian intelligence official that the National Security Agency had broken Iranian codes.</p>\n<p>That was a huge betrayal by the man some senior Bush administration officials had once considered installing as the leader of Iraq. But after I called the CIA and NSA for comment, NSA Director Michael Hayden called Taubman and asked him not to run the story. Hayden argued that even though Chalabi had told the Iranians that the U.S. had broken their codes, it wasn’t clear the Iranians believed him, and they were still using the same communications systems.</p>\n<p>Taubman agreed, and we sat on the story until the CIA public affairs office called and told him that someone else was reporting it, and that we should no longer feel bound not to publish. I was upset that I had lost an exclusive, and I believed that Hayden’s arguments against publication had been designed simply to save the White House from embarrassment over Chalabi.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Suddenly, as we were standing at the source’s front door, everything spilled out.</blockquote>\n<p>In the spring of 2004, just as the Plame case was heating up and starting to change the dynamics between the government and the press, I met with a source who told me cryptically that there was something really big and really secret going on inside the government. It was the biggest secret the source had ever heard. But it was something the source was too nervous to discuss with me. A new fear of aggressive leak investigations was filtering down. I decided to stay in touch with the source and raise the issue again.</p>\n<p>Over the next few months, I met with the source repeatedly, but the person never seemed willing to divulge what the two of us had begun to refer to as “the biggest secret.” Finally, in the late summer of 2004, as I was leaving a meeting with the source, I said I had to know what the secret was. Suddenly, as we were standing at the source’s front door, everything spilled out. Over the course of about 10 minutes, the source provided a detailed outline of the NSA’s massive post-9/11 domestic spying program, which I later learned was code-named Stellar Wind.</p>\n<p>The source told me that the NSA had been wiretapping Americans without search warrants, without court approval. The NSA was also collecting the phone and email records of millions of Americans. The operation had been authorized by the president. The Bush administration was engaged in a massive domestic spying program that was probably illegal and unconstitutional, and only a handful of carefully selected people in the government knew about it.</p>\n<p>I left that meeting shocked, but as a reporter, I was also elated. I knew that this was the story of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>The NSA had lived by strict rules against domestic spying for 30 years, ever since the Church Committee investigations of intelligence abuses in the 1970s had led to a series of reforms. One reform measure, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, made it illegal for the NSA to eavesdrop on Americans without the approval of a secret FISA court. My source had just revealed to me that the Bush administration was secretly ignoring the law requiring search warrants from the FISA court.</p>\n<p>I quickly began to think about how I could confirm the story and fortunately found the right person, a source who didn’t usually like to volunteer much information but was sometimes willing to confirm things I had heard elsewhere. As we sat alone in a quiet bar, I told the source what I had heard about the NSA program, and it was immediately clear that the source knew the same secret and was troubled by it.</p>\n<p>The source explained many of the technical details of the Bush administration’s secret NSA domestic spying program to me, describing how the NSA had latched onto giant gateway switches along the borders between the domestic and international telecommunications networks, so it could vacuum up all international phone traffic and email messages sent or received by Americans.</p>\n<p>As I worked to find more people to talk to about the story, I realized that the reporter sitting next to me in the Washington bureau, Eric Lichtblau, was hearing similar things. Lichtblau covered the Justice Department. When he first came to the paper in 2002, I had been jealous of his abilities as a reporter, especially his success at developing sources. I sometimes let my resentment get the better of me; I recall one meeting with Abramson in which I was openly dismissive of an exclusive story Lichtblau was working on. But he never held it against me, and we struck up a friendship and started working on stories together.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau had heard from a source that something potentially illegal was going on at DOJ, that officials seemed to be ignoring the law requiring warrants for national security wiretaps, and that Attorney General John Ashcroft might be involved.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau and I compared notes, and we realized we were probably hearing about the same story. We decided to work together.</p>\n<p>We both kept digging, talking to more people. We started doing some interviews together and discovered that we had very different reporting styles. While I liked to let a source talk about whatever was on their mind, Lichtblau liked to get right to the point, and sometimes badgered sources to cough up information. Our approaches were complementary, and we inadvertently developed a good cop-bad cop routine. Lichtblau would often give our sources colorful nicknames, which made it easier for us to talk without revealing their identities. He called one early source on the NSA story “Vomit Guy” because when he told the source what he wanted to talk about, the source told Lichtblau he was so upset about the topic that he wanted to throw up.</p>\n<p>By the fall of 2004, we had a draft of a story. I felt it was time to go through the front door, so I decided on impulse to try to bluff my way to the top of the NSA. I called the NSA’s press spokesperson, Judy Emmel, and told her I had to talk to Hayden immediately. I said it was urgent, and I couldn’t tell her what it was about.</p>\n<p>She got Hayden on the phone right away. I was shocked that my bluff had worked, but now that I had Hayden, I had to think fast about what I wanted to ask him. I decided to read him the first few paragraphs of the draft Lichtblau and I were writing. Lichtblau was sitting next to me, staring intently as I read Hayden the top of the story on the phone. I was sitting in front of my computer, ready to transcribe whatever Hayden would say.</p>\n<p>After I read the first few paragraphs, Hayden let out an audible gasp and then stammered for a moment. Finally, he said that whatever the NSA was doing was legal and operationally effective. I pressed him further, but he refused to say more and hung up.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">The Bush administration was engaged in a massive domestic spying program that was probably illegal and unconstitutional, and only a handful of carefully selected people in the government knew about it.</blockquote>\n<p>Hayden had all but confirmed the story. It seemed obvious from his response that he knew exactly what I was talking about and had begun to defend his actions before deciding to end the conversation. After explaining to Lichtblau what Hayden had just said, I walked over to Taubman’s office to tell him the news. “I thought it was a terrific scoop, but knew we would be faced with some tough questions about whether publication might undermine U.S. efforts to prevent another 9/11 style attack,” Taubman emailed me recently.</p>\n<p>Within days, Hayden called Taubman and asked him not to run the NSA story. Taubman listened, but was noncommittal. That was the beginning of what turned out to be more than a year of negotiations between the Times and the Bush administration, as officials repeatedly sought to kill the NSA story.</p>\n<p>A few days later, Taubman and I went to the Old Executive Office Building, next to the White House, to meet with acting CIA Director John McLaughlin, who had recently replaced Tenet, and McLaughlin’s chief of staff, John Moseman. We met them in the office the CIA director maintains in the OEB to be close to the White House. The meeting, the first of many between the Times and the government over the NSA story, was odd. In contrast to my meeting with Tenet and Rice on the Iran story, when they had confirmed the story while asking the paper to kill it, McLaughlin and Moseman refused to acknowledge that the NSA story was true, even as they asked us not to print it. They kept speaking in hypothetical terms, saying that if such a program existed, it would be important to the United States that it remain secret, and American newspapers shouldn’t report on such things.</p>\n<p>I had now been through this routine with the Bush administration several times, and their dire warnings about national security no longer impressed me. They had cried wolf too many times to be credible.</p>\n<p>Taubman didn’t give them an answer about whether the Times would publish the story, telling them it would be up to Keller. He also demanded that they warn us if they found out any other news organization was onto the same story.</p>\n<p>In his 2016 memoir, “Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror,” Hayden recalls that what he had heard from McLaughlin and Moseman convinced him that he could negotiate with Taubman, but not with me. “Taubman seemed to be thoughtful and reflective throughout. Risen was described as obnoxious, argumentative, and combative, commenting only to rebut with a constant theme of the public’s right to know,” Hayden writes. “Contemporaneous notes indicated that Taubman understood the seriousness of the question, while Risen doesn’t give a shit, frankly.” Hayden writes that as a result of that assessment, “we became pretty forthcoming — with Taubman.”</p>\n<p>As Lichtblau and I continued to report, we realized that we had to get a better understanding of how American and international telecommunications networks worked. I spent a day in the library at Georgetown University, poring over technical journals and academic works on the telecommunications industry. I called AT&amp;T’s headquarters and told the company’s spokesperson I was interested in learning more about the infrastructure of the telephone system, particularly the big switches that brought telephone and internet traffic into the United States. I did not tell the spokesperson why I was taking an interest in such an arcane issue, other than that it was for a story in the New York Times.</p>\n<p>At first, the spokesperson was very friendly and cooperative, and said he would be happy to have me talk with some of AT&amp;T’s technical experts, adding that he might be able to arrange a tour of their facilities. But I never heard from him again. I called back several times, but he didn’t return my calls. I finally figured that someone from the Bush administration had admonished AT&amp;T not to talk to me.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-167596790-bw-1-1514575054.jpg\"><img alt=\"GettyImages-167596790-bw-1-1514575054\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-167596790-bw-1-1514575054.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164369\"></a>\n<p>Bill Keller, former executive editor of the New York Times, in 2013.</p>\n<p>Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images</p></div>During October 2004, Lichtblau and I kept reporting and writing. We sometimes wrote at my house outside Washington, taking breaks to watch the epic baseball playoffs between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. Rebecca Corbett, our editor in the Washington bureau, had been working with us on the story.\n<p>We were operating against the backdrop of the 2004 presidential race between George W. Bush and John Kerry. With a week or two to go before the election, Lichtblau and I, along with Corbett and Taubman, went to New York for a meeting with Keller and Abramson to decide whether the story would be published.</p>\n<p>We sat in the back alcove of Keller’s office in the old Times building on 43rd Street. It was a comfortable, book-lined nook that I had visited once before, when I had tried to get Keller to change his mind and publish the long-spiked CIA-Iran story. Lichtblau, Corbett, and I argued strongly that the NSA story should be published.</p>\n<p>In that small room, we launched into an intense debate over whether to publish the story, dominated by the inherent tension between national security and the public’s right to know. A key issue was the legality of the NSA program. Keller seemed skeptical of our sources’ arguments that the program was illegal and possibly unconstitutional. There were some tense exchanges.</p>\n<p>I told Keller I thought this was the kind of story that had helped make the New York Times great in the 1970s, when Seymour Hersh had uncovered a series of intelligence abuses. Keller seemed unimpressed; as I recall, he called the comparison between the NSA story and Hersh’s earlier work “facile.” (I don’t think my comment was facile, but it was probably arrogant.)</p>\n<p>As the meeting wore on and Keller was unconvinced by each reason we gave for running the story, I grew more desperate to find some argument that might change his mind. Finally, I said that if we didn’t run the story before the election, a key source might go elsewhere and another news outlet might publish it.</p>\n<p>That was exactly the wrong thing to say to Keller. He got his back up, wondering aloud whether the source had a political agenda. He said he wouldn’t be pressured into running the story before the election because he didn’t want to let the potential political impact affect his journalistic decision. I pointed out that if he decided not to run the story before the election, that would also have an impact, but he seemed to ignore my comment.</p>\n<p>By the end of the meeting, he said he had decided not to run the story. In a recent interview, Keller acknowledged that my telling him that a source might go elsewhere with the story influenced his decision. “That set off alarm bells in my head,” Keller recalled, adding that he thought “we have a critical source with an animus.”</p>\n<p>Keller now also says that the overall climate in the country in 2004 provides important context for his decision not to run the story. In a 2013 interview with then-Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan, he expanded on that, saying that “three years after 9/11, we, as a country, were still under the influence of that trauma, and we, as a newspaper, were not immune. It was not a kind of patriotic rapture. It was an acute sense that the world was a dangerous place.”</p>\n<p>Keller’s rejection was a setback. But after the election, Lichtblau and I convinced the editors to let us start working on the story again. As we looked for more sources, we began to feel the chilling effect of the government’s new approach to leak investigations. Within the small group of people in the government who knew about the NSA program, many also knew by now that we were investigating it and were afraid to talk to us. On a snowy night in December 2004, we drove to the home of one official who Lichtblau believed knew about the NSA program. When the official opened the door, he recognized Lichtblau and quickly realized why we were there. He started berating us for showing up unannounced, told us to leave immediately, and shut the door. He seemed worried that someone might have seen us outside his house.</p>\n<p>The paper once again began meetings with top administration officials who wanted to stop us from running the story. In the weeks after the election, Lichtblau, Taubman, and I went to the Justice Department to meet with Deputy Attorney General James Comey and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales. Ashcroft had just resigned, and while it had not yet been announced, it was clear that Gonzales was about to replace him as attorney general. Now it was up to Gonzales to convince us to kill the story.</p>\n<p>But once the meeting started, Gonzales barely said anything; it seemed that the administration was temporarily happy to have gotten through the election without our story being published, and the tone in the room was more relaxed than usual. Comey did most of the talking. While he admitted that he had some qualms about the program, he kept insisting that it was too important to publicly disclose and that we shouldn’t run our story. (Comey did not reveal that he and several other top Justice Department officials, along with then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-mueller-comey-ashcroft-domestic-surveillance-20170517-story.html\">had nearly resigned over certain aspects of the program earlier in 2004</a>.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Hayden, who clearly had decided to make Taubman the focus of his lobbying campaign to stop the Times from publishing the story, invited him, but not Lichtblau or me, to NSA headquarters and allowed Taubman to talk with NSA officials directly involved in the domestic spying program. Afterward, Taubman told Lichtblau and me that he couldn’t tell us what he had learned. Today, Taubman says Hayden’s purpose “was to read me into the program on an off-the-record basis so I would have a better understanding of how it worked and why disclosure of it would be damaging to U.S. national security.”</p>\n<p>“When I returned to the bureau, I recall that Eric and you, not surprisingly, were eager to hear about the meeting,” Taubman told me in an email. “I described my visit in general, but said I had agreed not to tell anyone about the technical details I had learned, but would employ my knowledge by telling you if I saw anything in your draft story that I thought was incorrect.”</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">“When somebody gives you that kind of access and says lives will be at risk, you take them seriously.” — Bill Keller</blockquote>\n<p>Keller now says that Taubman’s relationship with Hayden played an important role in the decision to not run the story. “Certainly one factor was that Taubman knew Hayden pretty well, and he trusted him,” Keller told me. “Hayden invited Taubman out to where the guys were actually doing the NSA program. When somebody gives you that kind of access and says lives will be at risk, you take them seriously.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the White House decided to enlist members of the “Gang of Eight,” the handful of congressional leaders who had been secretly briefed on the program while the rest of Congress was kept in the dark. Then-Rep. Jane Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Taubman and made the case that the New York Times should not run the story.</p>\n<p>When I asked Taubman about this recently, he suggested that Harman’s call came as a result of his discussions with the government. Taubman recalls telling either Hayden or Rice that the Times needed to hear from the leaders of the congressional intelligence committees who knew about the program. “Jane Harman agreed to talk to me, on the condition that the call be off-the-record. She told me that she and her colleagues, Democrat and Republican, strongly supported the NSA effort and requested that the [Times] not disclose it.”</p>\n<p>By mid-December 2004, the story had been re-reported, so Lichtblau, Corbett, and I began pushing again to get it into the paper.</p>\n<p>Instead of traveling to New York this time, we held a series of closed-door meetings with Taubman in his office in Washington. The additional reporting and rewriting did not sway him. He accepted the Bush administration’s arguments that the piece would harm national security. He killed the story. This time, Keller was not directly involved in our meetings. The NSA story now seemed permanently dead.</p>\n<p>I was about to start a long-scheduled leave to write a book about the CIA and the Bush administration. I was furious that the Times had killed both the Iran and the NSA stories, and angry that the White House was successfully suppressing the truth. I told myself that if I kept going along with decisions to cut, bury, or outright kill so many stories, as I had the last few years, I wouldn’t be able to respect myself.</p>\n<p>I decided to put the Iran and the NSA stories in my book. I was pretty sure that meant I would be fired from the Times. It was nerve-wracking, but my wife, Penny, stood firm. “I won’t respect you if you don’t do it,” she told me. That sealed my decision.</p>\n<p>Throughout early 2005, I worked at home on “State of War,” which was scheduled to be published by Free Press, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, in early 2006. After I wrote the chapter about the NSA domestic spying program, I called Lichtblau and asked him to come to my house. When he arrived, I told him to sit down, read the chapter, and let me know whether it was OK to put the story in my book. After he finished reading, he joked that I had buried the lede, but I sharply reminded him that writing a book was different from writing a news story. He gave his approval to include it in the book, since he knew the story was dead at the Times. He only asked that I mention him by name in the chapter — and spell his name correctly.</p>\n<p>While I was on book leave, Lichtblau was in an agonizing position. Barred by his editors from working on the NSA story, he was instead assigned to cover the debate in Congress over the reauthorization of the Patriot Act. But Lichtblau knew that the debate over how to strike the proper balance between national security and civil liberties was a charade so long as the existence of the NSA’s domestic spying program was hidden from public view. The White House allowed Congress to publicly debate the balance, even while George W. Bush had already secretly decided what that balance would be. “Knowing about the NSA program, I found it increasingly awkward to write about all the back-and-forth haranguing with a straight face,” Lichtblau later wrote in his 2008 book, “Bush’s Law: The Remaking of American Justice.” “After getting back to the office from one congressional hearing that I covered on the Patriot Act that spring of 2005, I walked straight over to Rebecca Corbett’s desk in frustration to suggest that maybe someone else should cover the whole debate in Congress; in light of what we knew, I told her, I no longer felt comfortable covering what seemed a bit like a Washington game of three-card monte. … I was stuck on the story.”</p>\n<p>While covering one congressional hearing, Lichtblau listened as Harman called for tighter restrictions on the Patriot Act to prevent abuses of civil liberties. Lichtblau knew that Harman had been briefed on the NSA program and had called the Times to kill our story, so he followed her out into the hall to talk about it. But when he asked her how she could square her demands for limits on the Patriot Act with what she knew about the NSA program, Harman chided him for raising the matter. “Shooing away her aides, she grabbed me by the arm and drew me a few feet away to a more remote section of the Capitol corridor,” he wrote in his book. “‘You should <em>not</em> be talking about that here,’ she scolded me in a whisper. ‘<em>They</em> don’t even know about that,’ she said, gesturing to her aides, who were now looking on at the conversation with obvious befuddlement. ‘The Times did the right thing by not publishing that story.’”</p>\n<p><u>I returned from</u> book leave in May 2005 and finished my manuscript later that summer. In the late summer or early fall, after I turned in the last chapters to my publisher and the editing process at Free Press was virtually complete, I decided to let the Times know what I was doing.</p>\n<p>I emailed Jill Abramson, who by then was in New York, and told her that I was putting the NSA and the Iran stories in my book.</p>\n<p>The reaction was swift. Within minutes, Taubman was standing near my desk, grimly demanding to talk. We went into his office. He said firmly that I was being insubordinate and rebelling against the editorial decisions of the Times.</p>\n<p>“My view was that you and The Times had joint ownership of the story, that the top news executives, after careful consideration, had decided to hold the story, and that you did not have a unilateral right to publish it in your book,” Taubman recalled recently. “At the time, I was concerned that you were moving ahead with a volatile decision you had made absent consultation with me or Bill.”</p>\n<p>Taubman also recalls that he was angry because he believed I had misled him before I went on book leave into thinking I was going to write a biography of George Tenet. He’s probably right.</p>\n<p>He wanted me to take the NSA story out of my book. I responded that I wanted the NSA story to be published both in the Times and in my book.</p>\n<p>We began to talk almost every day about how to resolve our impasse. Initially, I suggested the paper run the NSA story when my book came out, under the kind of arrangement that the Washington Post seemed to have with Bob Woodward. The Post regularly excerpted Woodward’s books on its front page, giving the paper Woodward’s scoops and his books enormous publicity.</p>\n<p>That proposal went nowhere. Eventually, Taubman countered that the paper would only consider running the NSA story if I first agreed to remove it from my book and thus, give the paper the chance to reconsider its publication without any undue pressure. But I knew the only reason the Times would even consider running the NSA story was if I kept it in my book.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Abramson said she told Keller that “they would look like idiots” if they still were holding the story when it appeared in my book.</blockquote>\n<p>We were at loggerheads, and the clock was ticking toward the January 2006 publication of “State of War.” When I told Lichtblau what was going on, he joked, “You don’t just have a gun to their heads. You’ve got an Uzi.”</p>\n<p>While researching this personal account, I was surprised to learn that Abramson recalls that my email to her was not what started a debate among the Times senior editors about what to do about the NSA story and my book. Abramson says that by the time I emailed her, she already knew that I was putting the NSA story in my book. She says that another reporter in the Washington bureau had told her earlier that I was going to do it, and she had already told Bill Keller about my plans. She said she told Keller that “they would look like idiots” if they still were holding the story when it appeared in my book. “The classified program will be known publicly when Jim’s book is published anyway. So what could possibly be the point of continuing to hold it?” Abramson recalls telling him. “I had previously revisited publishing with Keller once or twice — maybe more,” Abramson told me recently. “I wanted the story published.”</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-525589996-bw-1-1514923350.jpg\"><img alt=\"GettyImages-525589996-bw-1-1514923350\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-525589996-bw-1-1514923350-1000x1333.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164555\"></a>\n<p>Eric Lichtblau in Derwood, Maryland.</p>\n<p>Photo: Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis/Getty Images</p></div><u>Besides Eric Lichtblau,</u> the Times’s top editors, and me, only a few people at the paper knew about the NSA story or the intense debate underway over whether to publish it. Lichtblau and I would sometimes walk around nearby Farragut Square when we wanted to speak in confidence. In front of most other reporters and editors in the office, I tried to act as if nothing unusual was going on, but I’m sure a few suspected something was up.\n<p>That fall, I became so concerned that the Times would not run the NSA story and that I would be fired that I secretly met with another national news organization about a job. I told a senior editor there that I had a major story that the Times had refused to run under pressure from the White House. I didn’t tell him anything about the story, but I said if they hired me, I would give the story to them. The senior editor replied that their publication would never run a piece if the White House raised objections on national security grounds. I left that meeting more depressed than ever.</p>\n<p>After a long series of contentious conversations stretching over several weeks in the fall of 2005, I finally reached an uneasy compromise with the editors. They would let Lichtblau and me start working on the NSA story again, and the paper would resume talks with the Bush administration over whether to publish it. But if the paper once again decided not to run the story, I had to take it out of my book. I agreed to those conditions, but I secretly knew that it was already too late to take the chapter out of my book, and I had no intention of doing so. I was gambling that the Times would run the story before the book was published. But I also knew that if the editors didn’t run it, I would probably be out of a job.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the Times editors seemed to shrug off the Iran story, even though they knew it was going to be in the book too. Maybe the NSA story was fresher in their minds. We didn’t have any significant discussions about whether to publish the Iran story in the paper, and the editors never complained to me about my decision to publish it in my book. (In 2014, Jill Abramson said in an interview with “60 Minutes” that she regretted that she didn’t push harder to get the Times to publish the CIA-Iran story.)</p>\n<p>The editors began a new round of meetings with Bush administration officials, who were apparently surprised that the Times was resurrecting the NSA story. I was excluded from these conversations. In each of the meetings in which they sought to convince the editors not to run the story, Bush administration officials repeatedly said the NSA program was the crown jewel of the nation’s counterterrorism programs, and that it saved American lives by stopping terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p>The meetings dragged on through the fall of 2005. Michael Hayden, now the principal deputy director of the Office of National Intelligence, often took the lead, and continued to meet with Philip Taubman. In one meeting, Taubman and Bill Keller received a secret briefing in which officials described the counterterrorism successes of the program. But when the two editors returned to the Washington bureau, they told Lichtblau and me that their briefing was off the record and so secret that they couldn’t share what they’d heard.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau and I eventually realized that Bush administration officials had been misleading Keller and Taubman. The officials had told them that under the NSA’s secret domestic spying program, the agency didn’t actually listen to any phone calls or read any emails without court-approved search warrants.</p>\n<p>They had insisted that the agency was only vacuuming up metadata, obtaining phone calling logs and email addresses. The content of the phone calls and email messages was not being monitored, the officials had told the editors. That was not true, but the government had been trying to convince Keller and Taubman that Lichtblau and I had been exaggerating the scope of the story.</p>\n<p>It took time, but Lichtblau and I were finally able to persuade Keller and Taubman that they had been misled. In our recent interview, Keller said that once he realized the administration had been disingenuous with him, he started to change his mind about publishing the story.</p>\n<p>It was also critically important that Lichtblau had developed a new source who said that some Bush administration officials had expressed fears that they might face prosecution for their involvement in the secret NSA spying operation. There had also been an intense debate at the highest levels of the Bush administration about the legality of some aspects of the program. That raised fundamental questions about the reassurances the Times editors had received from administration officials about the program’s standing.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">The official pulled me close and whispered, so quietly that none of the others in the room could hear, “Check out when Ashcroft was sick.”</blockquote>\n<p>In the late fall of 2005, I also got an important lead from a new source, but the tip was so cryptic I didn’t know what to make of it at the time. It came when a senior official agreed to see me, but only on the condition that our interview be conducted with other officials present. During that meeting, the official repeatedly and loudly expressed total ignorance of any secret NSA domestic spying program.</p>\n<p>But as I was leaving and stood up to shake hands, the official pulled me close and whispered, so quietly that none of the others in the room could hear, “Check out when Ashcroft was sick.”</p>\n<p>Lichtblau and I struggled for weeks to figure out what that tip meant.</p>\n<p>By late November 2005, Keller seemed to be leaning toward publishing the NSA story, but the editors were moving so slowly that I was getting nervous that they wouldn’t make up their minds before my book came out in January. I was more anxious than I had ever been in my life. I couldn’t sleep and began to develop high blood pressure. I tried to distract myself by going to the movies, but I was so stressed that I would usually walk out after five or 10 minutes. I also had to keep meeting with key sources on the NSA story to persuade them to stick with me and not take the story elsewhere. I urged them to be patient, though I was running out of patience myself. During meetings on the NSA story with Lichtblau and Rebecca Corbett, I was so fatigued and stressed that I would often lie down and shut my eyes on the couch in Corbett’s office.</p>\n<p>With the clock ticking and the publication of my book looming, Taubman asked me to arrange a new round of meetings with the very few Democratic congressional leaders who knew about the NSA program. He wanted them to tell him that it was OK to run the story. Both Lichtblau and I found this request troubling.</p>\n<p>I met with one Democrat who agreed to call Taubman, but the congressperson only told him the story was accurate, not whether the Times should run it. Taubman wanted more, so I went to see Nancy Pelosi, then the House minority leader, who had previously been the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. After she read the story, I asked her if she would call Taubman. Without confirming the story, she said simply, “The New York Times is a big institution. It can make its own decisions.”</p>\n<p>Then, after one final round of meetings with the White House in early December, Keller said he had decided to run the story. He called the White House and told them his decision. President Bush then called Arthur Sulzberger, the Times’s publisher, and asked for a personal meeting and a chance to convince Sulzberger to overrule Keller.</p>\n<p>It was intimidating stuff, but I was confident that Sulzberger would view this as a chance to live up to the legacy of his father, who had published the Pentagon Papers in the face of threats from the Nixon White House.</p>\n<p>Sulzberger, Keller, and Taubman went to the Oval Office to meet Bush. Lichtblau and I were not invited to the meeting and were not even allowed to meet with Sulzberger to brief him on the story beforehand.</p>\n<p>Keller <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/media/20334/\">later said</a> that Bush told Sulzberger he would have “blood on your hands” if he published the NSA story. Keller also said the meeting didn’t change his or Sulzberger’s minds about publishing the story.</p>\n<p>Keller and the other editors began to express confidence that the story would run, yet there was still no date for publication. In fact, the White House was trying to schedule more meetings with the editors to try one last time to change their minds. I was frantic; it was December, my book was coming out in early January, and the story still hadn’t run in the Times.</p>\n<p>Finally, Lichtblau came in with new information that prompted the Times to publish the story. Just days after the Bush-Sulzberger Oval Office meeting, a source told Lichtblau that the White House had considered getting a court-ordered injunction to prevent the Times from publishing the story. This was electric news, because the last time that had happened at the Times was during the Pentagon Papers case in the 1970s, one of the most important events in the history of the newspaper. The debate about whether to run the story was over. By that afternoon, the piece was ready to go.</p>\n<p>But there was one last thing: Keller included a line in the story saying that the article had been held for a year at the request of the Bush administration, which had argued it would harm national security. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html\">The final version of the story</a> stated: “The White House asked The New York Times not to publish this article, arguing that it could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert would-be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny. After meeting with senior administration officials to hear their concerns, the newspaper delayed publication for a year to conduct additional reporting.”</p>\n<p>We had one advantage over the Times of the early 1970s during the Pentagon Papers crisis, and that was the internet. It would be much more difficult for the White House to go to court to stop publication because we could quickly put the story online. So soon after Keller called the White House to tell them the story was running, the NSA story was posted on the New York Times website. It ran on the front page on December 16, 2005.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau, Corbett, Taubman, and I sat in Taubman’s office, listening over a speaker phone as Keller made the final decision to post the story. As the call with Keller ended, I let out a long sigh. Taubman looked at me. “What’s wrong?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Nothing. I’m just relieved.”</p>\n<p>In the years since, Taubman has reconsidered his decision-making on the NSA story, notably because of the leaks of NSA documents by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which revealed in greater detail the massive scale of the domestic surveillance operation. In the wake of Snowden’s revelations, Taubman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/public-editor/sullivan-lessons-in-a-surveillance-drama-redux.html\">told Sullivan</a>, the public editor, that his views had changed: “I would have made a different decision had I known that Jim and Eric were tugging on a thread that led to a whole tapestry.” (Ironically, the fact that the Times held the NSA story for more than a year convinced Edward Snowden not to come to the paper with his trove of documents when he became a whistleblower.)</p>\n<p>Today, Keller defends his handling of the NSA story — both in 2004 and in 2005 — and reflects that one factor was the changing climate in the country, which had soured on Bush, the war in Iraq, and the war on terror. “I’m pretty comfortable both with the decision not to publish and the decision to publish,” he told me recently.</p>\n<p>Keller decided to give the story only a one-column headline. As Lichtblau wrote in his book, “Keller had decided he didn’t want it to look like we were poking the White House in the eye with a big, screaming headline about NSA spying; we wanted to be discreet, he said, and the story would speak for itself.”</p>\n<p>I didn’t care about the lack of a banner headline. My game of chicken with the Times was over, and I felt like I had won.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/AP04121003294-bw-1-1514575040.jpg\"><img alt=\"AP04121003294-bw-1-1514575040\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/AP04121003294-bw-1-1514575040.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164366\"></a>\n<p>Outgoing Attorney General John Ashcroft watches an honor guard in the Great Hall of the Justice Department in Washington on Dec. 10, 2004.</p>\n<p>Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP</p></div>\n<h3><span>4<br>\nThe War on the Press</span><span> </span></h3>\n<p><u>The impact of</u> the story was immediate and explosive. George W. Bush was forced to confirm the existence of the program, even as he called the leak of information about it a “shameful act.” The administration quickly ordered an investigation, which was handed over to a grand jury. Teams of FBI agents were soon trying to hunt down our sources.</p>\n<p>Congress was outraged that the Bush administration had hidden the NSA program from all but a select handful of senior congressional leaders. The story ran the day the Senate was scheduled to vote on the reauthorization of the Patriot Act. Saying the NSA program made a mockery of the Patriot Act, lawmakers forced the vote’s delay. Both Republicans and Democrats vowed congressional investigations into the NSA program.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau and I scrambled to follow up with more stories, including one based on the strange tip I had received to check out what had happened when Ashcroft was sick. We learned that it was a reference to a secret rebellion against the NSA program by Comey and other top Justice Department officials, which had been triggered during a showdown with the White House in Ashcroft’s hospital room in March 2004.</p>\n<p>After an unusually tight pre-publication embargo, “State of War” was published in the first week of January 2006, but not before the Bush administration tried to intervene. In his 2014 book, “Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA,” former CIA lawyer John Rizzo describes how he got a panicked call from a National Security Council staffer at the White House on New Year’s Eve saying that it might be necessary to try to stop the publication of my book.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">One former CIA officer recalls that managers in his unit warned employees not to read “State of War”; doing so, they were told, would be like committing treason.</blockquote>\n<p>That night, then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers called Rizzo, suggesting that he call Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, to get him to stop the publication of the book by Simon and Schuster. Rizzo says he had decided not to make the call. Jack Romanos, chief executive of Simon and Schuster at the time, told me that other current and former government officials had also called, wanting to see the book before it was published. Simon and Schuster had refused.</p>\n<p>After it came out, the CIA was intensely angry about the book; one former CIA officer recalls that managers in his unit warned employees not to read “State of War”; doing so, they were told, would be like committing treason.</p>\n<p><u>I did a series</u> of TV interviews to publicize the book. Thanks to the line in the Times’s NSA story saying that the article had been held for a year at the Bush administration’s request, the story behind the story was naturally a hot topic. But each time I was asked about it, I simply said the Times had performed a public service by publishing the story, adding that I wouldn’t go into details about the paper’s internal deliberations. I wanted to keep the focus on the substance of the story itself. Interviewers weren’t always pleased with this. After a conversation with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8fYA3ESDgg\">Katie Couric on the “Today” show</a>, I quietly told her I was sorry I couldn’t answer her question. “Yeah, bullshit,” she replied.</p>\n<p>The Times also refused to explain the decision to hold the story, stonewalling media reporters and even the paper’s own public editor. “The New York Times’s explanation of its decision to report, after what it said was a one-year delay, that the National Security Agency is eavesdropping domestically without court-approved warrants was woefully inadequate,” <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/opinion/behind-the-eavesdropping-story-a-loud-silence.html\">wrote Times Public Editor Byron Calame</a> in early 2006. “And I have had unusual difficulty getting a better explanation for readers, despite the paper’s repeated pledges of greater transparency. For the first time since I became public editor, the executive editor and the publisher have declined to respond to my requests for information about news-related decision-making.”</p>\n<p>Several weeks later, I discovered that the Times hierarchy had been paying close attention to what I had been saying on my book tour about the paper’s decision-making. Lichtblau, Taubman, and I were asked to make a special presentation to the Times board of directors about the NSA story. Over lunch, one of the board members leaned over to me and quietly told me they were very grateful for the way I had been handling myself on television.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau and I <a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/james-risen-and-eric-lichtblau\">won a Pulitzer Prize</a> for our NSA stories. When the Times wins a Pulitzer, work in the main newsroom in New York stops at 3 p.m. on the day the prizes are officially announced, and the winners give brief speeches to the entire staff.</p>\n<p>When it was my turn, I got up and looked around at the crowd. I felt awkward, unsure what to say. For months, I had secretly lived with the fear of being fired for insubordination; now I was being honored for the same thing, by the same people. I decided to leave that issue alone for the day. I looked over at Keller and Sulzberger and said, “Well, thanks. You guys know what happened, how tough this was.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the political and legal reverberations from the NSA story were unlike those from any story I had ever done, and they continued to build. The story quickly led to protests and congressional hearings, lawsuits against the government and telecommunications companies, and calls for the creation of a new Church Committee.</p>\n<p>Fearful that the investigative floodgates were about to open, the Bush administration launched an aggressive campaign to counter the mounting criticism. In January 2006, it issued a “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2006/01/31/nsa-white-paper.pdf\">white paper</a>” laying out its arguments for why the program was legal and, behind the scenes, began lobbying leading members of Congress to stem calls for a major congressional inquiry. But the White House knew the NSA program was on thin ice, particularly after a federal judge sided with the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit and declared the program unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>White House anger at the New York Times for publishing the story grew. In May, Gonzales <a href=\"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EEDF103EF931A15756C0A9609C8B63\">told ABC</a> that the government could prosecute journalists for publishing classified information. He clearly had us in mind when he said it.</p>\n<p>“There are some statutes on the book which, if you read the language carefully, would seem to indicate that that is a possibility,” Gonzales said.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-813988692-bw-1-1514575068.jpg\"><img alt=\"GettyImages-813988692-bw-1-1514575068\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-813988692-bw-1-1514575068.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164372\"></a>\n<p>Senate Intelligence Committee member Sen.

Secret access to SWIFT meant the CIA could track the banking transactions of Americans and others without court approval.\n<p>Lichtblau had nicknamed one source “Death Wish” because during each interview he would say that he couldn’t talk about the SWIFT operation, and then would proceed to talk about it.</p>\n<p>This time, Lichtblau took the lead and was far more aggressive on the story than I was. I was burned out from the fight over the NSA story, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for another battle with the government over publication. I started to lose my nerve, privately suggesting to Lichtblau that we should delay the SWIFT story. Briefly panicking, I even thought about pulling my byline from the story.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Lichtblau called me on it. I quickly recovered from my malaise, and we finished the story.</p>\n<p>The editors at the Times, no doubt embarrassed by the way they had handled the NSA story, were now aggressively pushing us to do the SWIFT story and others. The Bush administration made only a halfhearted effort to block the SWIFT story. Treasury Secretary John Snow asked Keller not to run it, and a few other officials weighed in, but that was about it.</p>\n<p>Yet it was after the SWIFT story’s publication in June 2006 that the real onslaught against us began, led by conservatives in Congress and around the country who accused us of being repeat offenders harming national security.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">When my lawyers called the Justice Department, prosecutors refused to assure them that I was not a “subject” of their investigation. That was bad news.</blockquote>\n<p>Lichtblau and I had faced a storm of criticism after the NSA story; now the outcry grew far more intense. Right-wing groups organized hate mail campaigns against us and staged <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-news-war-secrets-sources-spin-part-ii/\">small but noisy protests</a> outside the Washington bureau and the Times building in New York.</p>\n<p>Conservative pundits and members of Congress went on television calling for Keller, Lichtblau, and me to be punished. Tom Cotton, then an Army officer in Iraq, wrote a letter to the Times saying that Lichtblau, Keller, and I should be jailed for harming national security. The Times didn’t publish the letter, but <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/10/a-fateful-letter-to-the-editor-of-the-times.php\">it was picked up</a> in the right-wing online universe of the time, and Cotton shot to fame in conservative circles as a result. He was later elected to the Senate as a Republican from Arkansas and soon may be named director of the CIA.</p>\n<p>Our notoriety also brought out conspiracy theorists and people who claimed the government was after them. Returning to the Washington bureau one day after lunch, I saw a lone man standing on the sidewalk in front of the building’s entrance, holding a sign claiming government harassment. “Hello, James,” he said as I approached. “I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>\n<p>More ominously, the Bush administration now had two major leak investigations underway — one into the NSA story in the New York Times, and the other into the Iran story I had included in “State of War.” Working with federal grand juries in Alexandria, FBI agents were starting to interview people I knew.</p>\n<p>Then there was a long lull, lasting more than a year. I thought the administration had decided not to take any action.</p>\n<p>But in August 2007, I found out that the government hadn’t forgotten about me. Penny called to tell me that a FedEx envelope had arrived from the Justice Department. It was a letter saying the DOJ was conducting a criminal investigation into “the unauthorized disclosure of classified information” in “State of War.” The letter was apparently sent to satisfy the requirements of the Justice Department’s internal guidelines that lay out how prosecutors should proceed before issuing subpoenas to journalists to testify in criminal cases.</p>\n<p>The Bush administration had evidently made a strategic decision not to go after the New York Times for our NSA stories. They apparently didn’t want a constitutional showdown with the newspaper. So instead, they were coming after me for what I had written in my book. I realized they were trying to isolate me from the Times. I later learned that the Justice Department and FBI had investigated a wide range of information included in several different chapters in my book before settling on the chapter that included the CIA-Iran story.</p>\n<p>Simon and Schuster agreed to pay for my legal defense until 2011, when my lawyers, Joel Kurtzberg and David Kelley of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, agreed to continue to handle the case pro bono. The New York Times did not pay any of my legal bills.</p>\n<p>When my lawyers called the Justice Department about the letter I had received, prosecutors refused to assure them that I was not a “subject” of their investigation. That was bad news. If I were considered a “subject,” rather than simply a witness, it meant the government hadn’t ruled out prosecuting me for publishing classified information or other alleged offenses.</p>\n<p>In January 2008, the Justice Department subpoenaed me to testify before a federal grand jury. I refused to comply, and my lawyers moved to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/AP_982073299913-bw-1-1514575035.jpg\"><img alt=\"AP_982073299913-bw-1-1514575035\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/AP_982073299913-bw-1-1514575035.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164365\"></a>\n<p>Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling leaves the Alexandria Federal Courthouse on Jan. 26, 2015, in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>\n<p>Photo: Kevin Wolf/AP</p></div><u>Meanwhile, the government</u> started an intense and secretive investigation to try to identify my sources. Several people subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury told me that prosecutors showed them phone records of calls between us and demanded to know what we had been talking about. The government eventually disclosed that they had not subpoenaed my phone records, but had subpoenaed the records of people with whom I was in contact. The government obtained my credit reports, along with my credit card and bank records, and hotel and flight records from my travel. They also monitored my financial transactions with my children, including cash I wired to one of my sons while he was studying in Europe.\n<p>One of the most egregious government plans to target me was not directly related to the leak investigation into “State of War.” But it apparently was under consideration at the same time I was fighting the government’s efforts to force me to testify.</p>\n<p>I have obtained evidence of an FBI agent discussing plans to ambush a meeting that the FBI thought was about to occur between a source and me in 2014. The evidence shows that the ambush plan was reviewed by senior Justice Department officials, who insisted the FBI make certain I would not be present when they arrested my source at the meeting. The evidence also reveals that the FBI was planning ways I could be delayed or diverted from the meeting at the last minute so they could arrest the source without me there.</p>\n<p>No such meeting occurred, so the FBI’s planned ambush was never conducted. But when I was later told about the FBI plan, it made me realize the degree to which I had become a focus of government investigators. The FBI declined to comment.</p>\n<p>In another recent incident that gave me chilling insight into the power of government surveillance, I met with a sensitive and well-placed source through an intermediary. After the meeting, which occurred a few years ago in Europe, I began to do research on the source. About an hour later, I got a call from the intermediary, who said, “Stop Googling his name.”</p>\n<p>In January 2008, after I received the first subpoena related to the CIA-Iran story in “State of War,” a series of procedural motions prolonged the fight over whether I would be forced to testify before the grand jury until after the 2008 presidential election.</p>\n<p>I thought Barack Obama’s election would end the case. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema seemed to think so, too. In July 2009, she issued a brief ruling noting that the grand jury in the case had expired, meaning my subpoena was no longer valid. I was surprised when Obama’s Justice Department quickly told Brinkema they wanted to renew the subpoena.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, this was one of the earliest signals that Obama was determined to extend and even expand many of Bush’s national security policies, including a crackdown on whistleblowers and the press. Ignoring the possible consequences to American democracy, the Obama administration began aggressively conducting surveillance of the digital communications of journalists and potential sources, leading to more leak prosecutions than all previous administrations combined.</p>\n<p>My case ground on for the next few years. It moved slowly because each time the administration came after me through some procedural motion or new subpoena, Brinkema sided with me. Her rulings in my favor meant that I was never actually ordered to testify before the grand jury.</p>\n<p>I kept thinking the administration would get the message from Brinkema and abandon the case. Instead, the Obama administration charged Jeffrey Sterling, the former CIA officer, for allegedly leaking information used in the CIA-Iran story.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-459952672-bw-1-1514575058.jpg\"><img alt=\"GettyImages-459952672-bw-1-1514575058\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/GettyImages-459952672-bw-1-1514575058.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164370\"></a>\n<p>U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Dec. 4, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Photo: Angelo Merendino/Getty Images</p></div><u>Sterling was indicted</u> in December 2010 and arrested in January 2011. The Justice Department subpoenaed me again, this time to testify at his trial.\n<p>Brinkema quashed that subpoena, too; once again, I thought I was off the hook. But just days before the trial was to begin, the Justice Department appealed. Obama administration prosecutors told the appeals court that Brinkema’s ruling should be overturned because there was no such thing as a reporter’s privilege in a criminal case. The appeals court accepted that argument, reversing Brinkema and ordering me to testify.</p>\n<p>The government’s rationale transformed my case into a showdown over press freedom in the United States. I felt that I had no choice but to appeal to the Supreme Court. Some outside media lawyers made it clear that they didn’t want me to do that because it might lead to a bad ruling from a conservative majority.</p>\n<p>That debate became moot in 2014, when the Supreme Court refused to take up the case. That allowed the appeals court ruling to stand, leaving the legal destruction of a reporter’s privilege in the 4th Circuit as Obama’s First Amendment legacy.</p>\n<p>But the government’s landmark legal victory came at a cost to the administration and particularly to Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder. For years, my lawyers and I had waged our legal campaign mostly alone with little fanfare, but as the case barreled toward a climax, the news coverage and publicity reached a fever pitch.</p>\n<p>With the surge in media attention came added pressure on Holder, and he finally began to back down. He said that as long as he was attorney general, no reporter would go to jail for doing their job. He also modified the Justice Department guidelines that defined when the government would seek to compel the testimony of journalists in leak investigations. (Donald Trump’s Justice Department is now widely expected to weaken those guidelines, making it easier to go after reporters.)</p>\n<p>But even though Holder was making conciliatory public statements, the federal prosecutors directly involved in my case kept fighting hard. At one point, Holder hinted that the Justice Department and I were about to strike a deal, when in fact the prosecutors and my lawyers hadn’t negotiated any deal at all. Behind the scenes, there seemed to be a war going on between Holder and the prosecutors, who were angry at what they perceived as Holder undercutting them. The prosecutors had repeatedly told the court that they needed my testimony to make their case against Sterling. Holder, after supporting their aggressive approach for years, had suddenly reversed direction under public pressure. I was caught in the middle.</p>\n<p>Finally, in late 2014, we saw the first signs that the prosecutors were softening their stance. They demanded my appearance at the January 2015 pretrial hearing in Alexandria to determine the scope of my possible testimony in Sterling’s trial. But unlike the previous subpoenas, this new one sought my limited testimony and did not demand that I identify confidential sources.</p>\n<p>Then, as I sat in the conference room with my lawyers waiting for the hearing to start, the prosecutors launched a last-minute offensive. They said they wanted me to get on the witness stand and point out which passages in my book were based on classified information and confidential sources. I refused.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Risen-1514923006.jpg\"><img alt=\"Risen-1514923006\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/01/Risen-1514923006-1000x1333.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164551\"></a>\n<p>James Risen, center, leaves the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 5, 2015.</p>\n<p>Photo: Cliff Owen/AP</p></div><u>As I took the</u> stand at the 2015 hearing, I found it hard to contain my frustration and disgust. “I am not going to provide the government with information that they seem to want to use to create a mosaic to prove or disprove certain facts,” I told Brinkema.\n<p>The lead prosecutor, James Trump (no apparent relation to Donald), did not ask who my sources were or what they’d told me. Instead, he asked again whether I would refuse to identify my sources, even if it meant going to jail.</p>\n<p>I told him I would.</p>\n<p>Trump then turned to questions <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/us/james-risen-in-tense-testimony-refuses-to-offer-clues-on-sources.html?mtrref=www.google.com&login=email\">I had already answered in court filings</a>, asking whether I had indeed relied on confidential sources and trying to confirm that I had spoken to Sterling for an unrelated 2002 New York Times article. He wanted me to answer them aloud, in open court.</p>\n<p>I was defiant and refused to answer basic questions.</p>\n<p>Brinkema began to lose patience with me. I asked for a break to talk with my lawyers.</p>\n<p>I returned to the witness stand and answered a few more routine questions. Trump soon announced that he had nothing more for me. In the end, the prosecutors had backed down and followed Holder’s instructions.</p>\n<p>It was all over, almost before I realized it. I walked out of the court and drove straight home.</p>\n<p>I believe my willingness to fight the government for seven years may make prosecutors less eager to force other reporters to testify about their sources. At the same time, the Obama administration used my case to destroy the legal underpinnings of the reporter’s privilege in the 4th Circuit, which means that if the government does decide to go after more reporters, those reporters will have fewer legal protections in Virginia and Maryland, home to the Pentagon, the CIA, and the NSA, and thus the jurisdiction where many national security leak investigations will be conducted. That will make it easier for Donald Trump and the presidents who come after him to conduct an even more draconian assault on press freedom in the United States.</p>\n<p>The battles over national security reporting in the years after 9/11 have yielded mixed results. In my view, the mainstream media has missed some key lessons from the debacle over WMD reporting before the war in Iraq. Times reporter Judy Miller became an easy scapegoat, perhaps because she was a woman in the male-dominated field of national security reporting. Focusing on her made it easier for everyone to forget how widespread the flawed pre-war reporting really was at almost every major media outlet. “They wanted a convenient target, someone to blame,” Miller told me recently. The anti-female bias “was part of it.” She notes that one chapter in her 2015 memoir, “<a href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Story/Judith-Miller/9781476716022\">The Story</a>: A Reporter’s Journey,” is titled “Scapegoat.”</p>\n<p>Since then, I believe the Times, the Washington Post and other national news organizations have sometimes hyped threats from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The exaggerated reporting on terrorism, in particular, has had a major political impact in the United States and helped close off debate in Washington over whether to significantly roll back some of the most draconian counterterrorism programs, like NSA spying.</p>\n<p>But overall, I do believe that the fight inside the Times over the NSA story helped usher in a new era of more aggressive national security reporting at the paper. Since then, the Times has been much more willing to stand up to the government and refuse to go along with White House demands to hold or kill stories.</p>\n<p>The greatest shame of all is that <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/18/jeffrey-sterling-took-on-the-cia-and-lost-everything/\">Jeffrey Sterling</a> was convicted and sentenced to 42 months in prison.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/\">My Life as a New York Times Reporter in the Shadow of the War on Terror</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

It abruptly made its announcement </span><a href=\"https://sandiego.urbdezine.com/files/2017/08/letter.pdf\"><span>in an August letter</span></a><span> to public housing authorities, and when The Intercept asked for further comment in October, HUD spokesperson Brian Sullivan </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/23/ben-carson-hud-lawsuit-section-8-vouchers-fmr-naacp/\"><span>said</span></a><span> there had been “no change in policy.” He pointed to an </span><a href=\"https://blog.hud.gov/index.php/2017/08/25/giving-public-housing-agencies-time-succeed/#more-9121\"><span>August 25 blo</span><span>g</span></a><span><a href=\"https://blog.hud.gov/index.php/2017/08/25/giving-public-housing-agencies-time-succeed/#more-9121\"> post</a> drafted by Acting General Deputy Assistant Secretary Todd Richardson, which said the decision was “informed by research” and that it would be beneficial to delay the rule’s implementation to allow for further study.</span></p>\n<p><span>On December 1, HUD </span><a href=\"http://prrac.org/pdf/HUD%20Opposition.pdf\"><span>offered more detail</span></a><span>.</span><span> In court filings, the federal agency argued its actions fell under its broad discretionary power and therefore, were not subject to judicial review. HUD also released a </span><a href=\"http://prrac.org/pdf/Suspension%20memo.pdf\"><span>previously undisclosed</span></a><span> August 10 memo from Carson, outlining the agency’s rationale for the rule’s delay. Carson’s memorandum relied heavily on findings from</span> <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/SAFMR-Interim-Report.pdf\"><span>an interim report</span></a><span>, which found that of five areas selected to pilot the Small-Area Fair Market Rents, the total number of available units went down. HUD lawyers argued that these findings “fully and independently justif[y]” the suspension.  </span></p>\n<p><span>However, U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell disagreed. In her</span><a href=\"http://www.naacpldf.org/files/case_issue/HUD%20Preliminary%20Injunction%20Opinion.pdf\"> <span>47-page decision</span></a><span>, she granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction and outlined why HUD’s legal authority is more circumscribed than the agency purported. She also noted that the interim report upon which HUD was relying was based on five areas selected for criteria totally unrelated to the 24 metropolitan areas picked to be subjected to the rule. “This is really apples and oranges, isn’t it?” she asked Johnny Walker, a U.S attorney representing HUD in court.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sasha Samberg-Champion, the attorney who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs at the December 19 hearing, told The Intercept that he and his colleagues were heartened and impressed by how well Howell understood the issues. “She was just phenomenally well-prepared, not only having read the parties’ briefing papers, but she also really dove into the documents presented,” he said. “I think HUD was just not prepared to answer questions at the level of specificity that she was asking.”</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, when Howell asked HUD’s counsel if any of the 24 metropolitan areas had “formally, or even informally” requested that the federal government suspend its implementation of the Small Area Fair Market Rents rule, both Walker and HUD’s trial attorney David Sahli said they weren’t sure. Sahli eventually admitted that to his knowledge, no such request had been made. This was notable, because the </span><a href=\"http://prrac.org/pdf/SAFMR-Final-Rule.pdf\"><span>final rule</span></a><span> indicated that a suspension could occur at the request of a public housing authority.</span></p>\n<p><span>One of the plaintiffs’ main arguments was that HUD violated the Administrative Procedure Act, an important federal statute that imposes specific limitations on the process of agency rule-making, including a requirement that agencies collect and respond to public comments. “HUD’s main argument was that there’s a regulatory provision that gives the secretary carte blanche to suspend the rule at any time for any reason, and the judge clearly was skeptical of that,” said Samberg-Champion.</span></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps foreseeing Howell’s skepticism, HUD announced in early December that it would open up a 30-day period to solicit public comment about suspending the Small-Area Fair Market Rents rule. That 30 days </span><a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/12/2017-26695/notice-for-suspension-of-small-area-fair-market-rent-small-area-fmr-designations-solicitation-of\"><span>began December 11</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>HUD claimed that by opening up a month for public comment, it had rendered the plaintiffs’ procedural claims moot. “This argument is meritless,” wrote the plaintiffs in</span><a href=\"http://prrac.org/pdf/Reply_brief.pdf\"> <span>a reply brief</span></a><span> filed in December. “If anything, HUD’s belated notice simply confirms the illegality of its suspension.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“Procedurally, this is totally irrelevant because the Administrative Procedure Act doesn’t allow you to solicit comments belatedly,” explained Samberg-Champion. “But for whatever reason, atmospherically, HUD felt they needed to do this.”</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s not clear whether HUD will appeal Howell’s decision. Sullivan, the HUD spokesperson, did not return The Intercept’s request for comment.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I’m not going to make any predictions about what HUD will or won’t do, but I hope they will now carry out the laws they’re supposed to,” said Samberg-Champion. “They have the right to appeal should they choose, but I hope they don’t do that. All they’d be doing is frankly stalling, and they would lose that as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Ajmel Quereshi, a senior counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, another civil rights group participating in the lawsuit, told The Intercept that at a minimum, HUD has an obligation to “immediately begin working” with local housing agencies to implement the rule, so the new payment standards can take effect as soon as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We expect they’ll comply with the court order,” he said, “and we look forward to working with HUD to see positive results for thousands of families.” </span></p>\n<p>Top photo: Section 8 voucher holders view an apartment with a Housing Choice Partners real estate specialist in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago, on June 27, 2015.

Of the reports it did complete, many were turned in well past the assigned due date and only “complete” in the sense that they consist of words on paper. </span></p>\n<p><span>In his first year in office, Trump ordered 95 separate reports, performance reviews, instructions, or other activities to be carried out by executive branch agencies. </span><a href=\"https://projects.theintercept.com/eo-tracker/\"><span>The Intercept has been reviewing</span></a><span> these orders for the last year. We found that 48 of the 95 actions were completed, in many cases after the due date stipulated in the order. Federal agencies have yet to complete another 20. In 27 cases, the agency was unresponsive to our requests for information.</span></p>\n<p>We finished our review of the administration’s record on executive orders at the end of 2017. Here’s our tracker in full:</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://projects.theintercept.com/eo-tracker/mini/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n<p><span>The executive orders were intended to form the building blocks of Trump’s governing strategy. They covered everything from defeating the Islamic State, to instituting signature policies on immigration and cybersecurity, to fashioning the administration’s position on regulatory reform and energy independence. That the executive branch has completed just half of the tasks the president had ordered suggests that the administration isn’t running like the “</span><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-administration-running-fine-tuned-machine/story?id=45540067\"><span>fine-tuned machine</span></a><span>” Trump has boasted about. If federal agencies cannot do the basic block-and-tackling work of writing a progress report, their ability to operate in a crisis is highly questionable.</span></p>\n<p><span>The administration’s track record also reinforces the incredible secrecy within the Trump government. Only 19 of the 48 completed reports were publicly released. The Intercept attempted to obtain the still-private reports under the Freedom of Information Act and ran into continuous brick walls. Either the administration chose not to commit its plans to written documents so that those looking for information would have nothing to discover, or it deliberately hid them from the public. Cabinet heads have made it difficult for people to obtain their </span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/26/trump-cabinet-agenda-secret-319046\"><span>public schedules</span></a><span>, let alone the reports they write to the president laying out their agenda.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, in April, the president </span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-buy-american-hire-american/\"><span>signed an executive order</span></a><span> on “Buy American and Hire American” rules for the federal government. It laid out a series of steps for executive agencies to prioritize American products and materials in federal procurement, as well as to step up enforcement of “Buy American” laws within their jurisdictions. </span></p>\n<p><span>The policy is central to fulfilling Trump’s “America First” agenda. The secretary of Commerce and the Office of Management and Budget were to collate reports from agency heads on compliance, as well as assess the impacts of trade agreements on “Buy American” laws. And by November 24, the Commerce Department was to submit a final report, with recommendations on strengthening those laws so that the campaign promise could become reality.</span></p>\n<p><span>The agency has not confirmed its completion of any of those reports. It took a Democrat, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, </span><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/12/baldwin-presses-trump-administration-buy-b/945550001/\"><span>to write the White House</span></a><span> asking for the final report on December 12, 18 days after it was due. “I understand that the report is not finished and I am writing to urge your Administration to expedite the publication of this now late report,” she wrote. The Intercept asked the Commerce Department whether the preliminary reports were completed; the agency did not respond. </span></p>\n<p><span>Trump’s “Buy American” plan could theoretically be a place for bipartisan cooperation and is one that aligns with the president’s promises to his base to restore jobs to the “forgotten man.” But all of that is apparently not enough of a priority for the administration to bother with it.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other examples display the White House’s penchant for secrecy. The </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/trump-expected-to-shrink-2-utah-monuments-by-two-thirds\"><span>shrinking of two national monuments</span></a><span> in Utah, announced in early December, came after a </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/13/the-interior-departments-first-memo-for-donald-trump-is-a-real-howler/\"><span>comically thin interim report</span></a><span> on recent monument designations in June and a final report in August of which the public only got to see a </span><a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-zinke-sends-monument-report-white-house\"><span>two-page executive summary</span></a><span>. Journalists had to look to </span><a href=\"https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2017/11/30/apc-report-leaked-documents-detail-trumps-plan-to-shrink-2-utah-monuments/#.WkUn5UtG1E4\"><span>leaked documents</span></a><span> to ferret out that the Utah monuments would be targeted for shrinkage. Even members of Congress </span><a href=\"http://registerguard.com/rg/opinion/36125770-78/protect-cascade-siskiyou.html.csp?platform=hootsuite\"><span>only learned about the plans</span></a><span> when they were leaked to the media.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ultimately, Trump modified the </span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-modifying-bears-ears-national-monument/\"><span>Bears Ears</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-modifying-grand-staircase-escalante-national-monument/\"><span>Grand Staircase-Escalante</span></a><span> national monuments and could shrink several more, if he acts on a report from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke that the Washington Post first </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/shrink-at-least-4-national-monuments-and-modify-a-half-dozen-others-zinke-tells-trump/2017/09/17/a0df45cc-9b48-11e7-82e4-f1076f6d6152_story.html\"><span>reported</span></a><span>. Several Native American tribes have </span><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/monument-trump-utah-shrink-conservation-tribes-sue/index.html\"><span>sued the Trump administration</span></a><span> over the monument changes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Similarly, while the Department of Homeland Security has </span><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/dhs-orders-federal-agencies-beef-up-cyber-security-2497288023.html\"><span>ordered federal agencies</span></a><span> to enhance cybersecurity efforts, only four of the 14 reports scheduled to be delivered to the White House per a </span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-strengthening-cybersecurity-federal-networks-critical-infrastructure/\"><span>sweeping cybersecurity executive order</span></a><span> have been confirmed as completed, and none of them have been made public.</span></p>\n<p><span>The case of the president’s commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis is also instructive. The commission </span><a href=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9587459/Trump_opioid_commission_final_report.0.pdf\"><span>completed reports ordered by Trump</span></a><span> — albeit belatedly — and made its recommendations public. And after </span><a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/christie-on-trump-not-declaring-emergency-opioid-crisis\"><span>some prodding</span></a><span>, the Trump administration declared the opioid crisis a </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html?_r=0\"><span>national emergency</span></a><span>, which in theory freed up some resources to deal with the scourge. But the emergency declaration </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/27/trump-opioid-crisis-public-health-emergency/\"><span>unlocked around 2 cents</span></a><span> for each individual suffering from opioid use disorder in America, neglecting to add new money to the paltry $57,000 in the Public Health Emergency Fund. </span></p>\n<p><span>The commission, following Trump’s lead, also </span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/31/trump-opioid-panel-money-244390\"><span>didn’t ask for new money</span></a><span> to deal with the crisis, making its recommendations quaint but rather symbolic. To date, there’s been </span><a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/trump-opioid-crisis-big-talk-little-action-big-surprise/\"><span>little action</span></a><span> on preventing opioid addiction, and deaths from the epidemic continue to play a significant role in </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db293.pdf\"><span>declining life expectancy in America</span></a><span>, a trend not seen in over half a century.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some of the reports have been useful in understanding the White House position on key issues. The series of </span><a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/2018-03004_Tax_EO_report.pdf\"><span>Treasury</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/FSOC_Designations_PM_factsheet%2011-16-17.pdf\"><span>Department</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0173.aspx\"><span>reports</span></a><span> on the financial system and regulatory burdens has clarified where it stands on issues like </span><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/treasury-holds-onto-obama-era-inversion-rules-for-now-2494826841.html\"><span>corporate taxes</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-team-to-recommend-keeping-dodd-frank-liquidation-power-1511953200\"><span>how to unwind big banks</span></a><span> that get into trouble. But this has been the exception more than the rule.</span></p>\n<p><span>Trump has not stopped </span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-resuming-united-states-refugee-admissions-program-enhanced-vetting-capabilities/\"><span>issuing executive orders</span></a><span> and ordering reports and reviews.

Nos últimos anos, e principalmente desde a eleição de Donald Trump, a Patrulha Rodoviária do Texas, parte do Departamento Estadual de Segurança Pública (DPS), desenvolveu uma máquina bem azeitada de deportação, que encontra motoristas que cometeram infrações leves de trânsito e os encaminha à Patrulha de Fronteira ou até mesmo ao Serviço de Imigração e Controle Aduaneiro. Passageiros e pedestres que sequer estavam dirigindo também são apreendidos. As vidas dos imigrantes presos no sistema de deportação do Texas são prejudicadas ou destruídas, juntamente com as de seus filhos, muitas vezes nascidos e criados nos EUA.</p>\n<p>É difícil ter uma noção exata da frequência com que isso acontece. Os registros do DPS são caros, difíceis de obter e de interpretar. Os dados sobre os encaminhamentos só passaram a ser coletados em dezembro de 2015 e, desde então, as comunicações desses incidentes são irregulares. Até hoje a comunicação dos agentes sobre as abordagens que resultaram em encaminhamentos à Patrulha de Fronteira ainda é inconsistente. Por meio dos pedidos de acesso à informação, a União Americana das Liberdades Civis (ACLU) do Texas verificou que a documentação interna da agência não tinha registro dos encaminhamentos de diversos indivíduos que os encarregados locais sabiam ter sido detidos pela patrulha rodoviária, presos, e, em alguns casos, expulsos do país.</p>\n<p>Em seguida, The Intercept e a ACLU atuaram em conjunto para obter vídeos de câmeras veiculares (“dashcams”) do DPS, que mostram imigrantes sendo detidos em rodovias por infrações triviais e conduzidos pela Patrulha de Fronteira.</p>\n<div>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/xRIuqqX8-O8lzxR7r.html\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Um vídeo de câmera veicular da Patrulha Rodoviária do Texas mostra como uma abordagem de trânsito de rotina se tornou um pesadelo para uma família.</p>\n<p>Os detalhes dessas deportações foram reunidos inicialmente com base na papelada e nos vídeos do DPS, obtidos por meio dos pedidos de acesso à informação. Localizamos então os detidos e suas famílias, inclusive no México. Visitamos as pessoas em casa e mostramos as filmagens. Enquanto assistiam, pais e filhos conversavam sobre como suas vidas foram viradas de cabeça para baixo pelos patrulheiros do Texas e sobre a atual política de imigração estadual e federal.</p>\n<p>Ruth Mariel Ramirez, de 30 anos, foi uma das pessoas apreendidas. Ela tem quatro filhos, três deles nascidos nos EUA. Até o seu encontro com o DPS alguns meses atrás, ela e sua família viviam confortavelmente na região de El Paso. Agora estão passando dificuldades na cidade de Juárez, no México, uma área pobre e assolada pela violência dos cartéis de drogas.</p>\n<p>Ruth cresceu em Juárez, logo depois da fronteira, num bairro violento e tomado pelas drogas, com um pai viciado que acabou morrendo de AIDS. Ela conta que, atualmente, a maior parte dos seus amigos de infância que ainda estão vivos são traficantes de drogas, matadores de aluguel para os cartéis, ou viciados. Aos 13 anos Ruth deu à luz seu filho, Brayan, e aos 15 atravessou para El Paso com Brayan em busca de uma vida mais segura com um casal de tios. Ela se envolveu com um homem com quem teve mais três filhos, mas o relacionamento não deu certo e o casal se separou. Ruth então conheceu Jaime Ortiz, um imigrante legal que está há muitos anos nos EUA e tem um bom emprego, que exige que ele viaje durante a semana. Ele se tornou uma afetuosa figura paterna para os filhos de Ruth, e ela passou a ser mais ativa em sua igreja, estudou o conteúdo do ensino médio e passou no teste GED [um exame certificação].</p>\n<p>As crianças viviam como típicos texanos. Mariel Carolina,13 anos, era ótima aluna e já estava planejando entrar em uma escola do tipo “early college” [“faculdade antecipada”, onde os alunos do ensino médio já frequentam algumas aulas de faculdade e depois usam os créditos na universidade] em El Paso, para adiantar seu sonho de se tornar pediatra. Brayan, aos 15, jogava futebol e praticava levantamento de peso, e desde os 12 já era um compositor e rapper entusiasmado.</p>\n<p>Numa manhã de domingo, no começo de março deste ano, Ruth foi às compras e saiu apressada para se preparar para a escola dominical às 11h. Ela pretendia ir para casa, lavar e passar as roupas de James e fazer comida para recebê-lo da viagem daquela semana. Tinha uma consulta marcada no dia seguinte com o advogado que estava conduzindo o processo de Brayan no programa Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, também conhecido como DREAM Act, a política imigratória que beneficiava as pessoas que haviam chegado ao país menores de idade) – ela já havia gasto centenas de dólares em honorários e as impressões digitais de Brayan já tinham sido colhidas. Também tinha agendado uma visita à escola para começar o processo de registro de Mariel Carolina.</p>\n<p>A igreja terminou mais cedo na tarde de domingo, e Ruth e sua filha estavam voltando para casa na caminhonete quando foram paradas por uma dupla de patrulheiros em um veículo. Ao ouvir a sirene, Ruth não conseguia imaginar o que poderia ter feito. Ela conta que havia sido parada por patrulheiros algumas vezes em anos anteriores, por causa de infrações de trânsito, e que havia simplesmente recebido as multas, que pagou imediatamente. Não se preocupou quando disseram que ela havia sido parada porque a película das janelas estava muito escura, até perceber que a abordagem na verdade não tinha a ver com as janelas. A questão era seu status imigratório. Quando a noite chegou, ela já havia sido sugada para o sistema de deportação do DPS e da Patrulha de Fronteira.</p>\n<p>O fluxo começa com uma regulação do departamento de veículos automotores exigindo como condição para a habilitação de condutores a comprovação de que residem legalmente nos EUA. A regra entrou em vigor em 2008, e seus resultados foram drásticos. Vários texanos não documentados foram forçados a dirigir sem habilitação, especialmente nas regiões em que o transporte público é ineficiente ou inexistente.</p>\n<div>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/s4eVtDeW-O8lzxR7r.html\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Um vídeo de câmera automotiva da Patrulha Rodoviária do Texas mostra o agente Cristobal Flores questionando repetidamente um imigrante sem documentos sobre sua habilitação.</p>\n<p>No Texas, de acordo com um estudo do Pew Research Center, aproximadamente 6% da população não tem documentos – 1 em cada 18 pessoas. Nos condados de fronteira, no entanto, onde as pessoas passam décadas atravessando de um lado para o outro entre os países para encontrar os familiares, tradicionalmente não se presta muita atenção ao status migratório. Nessas comunidades, o número de pessoas sem documentos é muito maior. No condado de El Paso, onde viviam Ruth e sua família, cerca de 8% da população não tem papéis.</p>\n<p>A casa de Ruth ficava em San Elizario, uma cidade que séculos atrás era um vilarejo de fazendeiros, e que fica a 30 quilômetros rio abaixo de El Paso. Durante muitos anos, era proibido aos xerifes-delegados da região perguntar às pessoas sobre seu status migratório durante as abordagens de trânsito.</p>\n<p>No passado, era fácil encontrar patrulheiros nas regiões mais densamente povoadas do Texas, centro e leste, mas eles eram raros na fronteira com o México, de menor adensamento populacional. Mas os patrulheiros foram sendo enviados para o sul e para o oeste, a comunidades onde 75 a 98% da população é constituída por latinos, principalmente de ascendência mexicana.</p>\n<p>A “onda” de patrulheiros na região de fronteira teve origem nos ataques terroristas de 11 de setembro. Com a criação do Departamento de Segurança Interna dos EUA em 2003, políticos conservadores do Texas começaram a vomitar um discurso sobre os perigos do narcotráfico, do tráfico de pessoas e do terrorismo que estariam espalhados pela fronteira entre Estados Unidos e México. Já em 2006, o governador do Texas Rick Perry estava canalizando recursos federais para os departamentos de fronteira e para o Departamento de Segurança Pública, a agência estadual que inclui os patrulheiros rodoviários e os Texas Rangers. Em 2008, o legislativo texano começou a alocar recursos estaduais para “segurança de fronteira”. O orçamento desse item disparou a partir daí, de 110 milhões de dólares para o biênio de 2008 e 2009, a 800 milhões para 2018 e 2019. O grosso disso vai para o DPS.</p>\n<p>Os recursos vêm sendo gastos em atividades com nomes de inspiração militar como “missões de reconhecimento” e “Operação Segurança Forte”. As operações e missões são acompanhadas de canhoneiras, helicópteros e drones. Durante um período de alguns meses, em 2008, esteve no ar até mesmo um site controlado pela Aliança dos Xerifes de Fronteira do Texas em que “voluntários” civis podiam ter acesso às imagens de câmeras escondidas na região fronteiriça do Texas e comunicar por telefone os “avistamentos” de suspeitos de travessias irregulares e criminosos. Quase 25 mil pessoas se inscreveram para serem “delegados virtuais”. Aproximadamente um ano depois, no entanto, quando o programa foi discretamente interrompido, o trabalho dos tais “delegados” tinha levado a apenas onze apreensões, a um custo de dois milhões de dólares.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">O número de autuações e advertências de trânsito disparou em diversos condados de fronteira depois que os patrulheiros de “segurança de fronteira” chegaram, e os líderes políticos locais reclamam que seus eleitores se sentem sitiados.</blockquote>\n<p>No rumo contrário da hipérbole política, na realidade a fronteira tem índices baixos de criminalidade quando comparada ao restante do estado. Não há notícia de nenhum terrorista que já tenha atravessado a fronteira entre México e Estados Unidos. E segundo a organização apartidária Conselho de Orçamento Legislativo (Legislative Budget Board), que assessora o legislativo estadual do Texas sobre o tema da eficiência das agências estaduais, as alegações do DPS sobre a efetividade do combate ao crime não são confiáveis, porque a agência não fornece medidas quantitativas sobre a segurança na fronteira.</p>\n<p>O número de autuações e advertências de trânsito disparou em diversos condados de fronteira depois que os patrulheiros de “segurança de fronteira” chegaram, e os líderes políticos locais reclamam que seus eleitores se sentem sitiados. Um funcionário do DPS explicou em uma <a href=\"http://www.ronwhitlock.com/RWREPORTS/VIDEOS/Entries/2015/10/1_DPS_233_TicketIncrease_%22Is_Unacceptable%22.html\">entrevista</a> que os patrulheiros estariam fazendo abordagens por infrações irrelevantes, como o posicionamento das placas de identificação dos veículos, para fazer verificações dos motoristas e passageiros com relação a crimes graves. Essas abordagens sob pretexto se tornaram um meio importante de cercar imigrantes sem documentos.</p>\n<p>Durante esse período, abordagens por infrações leves de trânsito diversas vezes acabaram levando os patrulheiros a acionar a Patrulha de Fronteira. Mas na maior parte do tempo, os agentes da Patrulha de Fronteira não estavam interessados em deportar esses “achado” inofensivos. Pessoas que já viviam nos EUA há anos, sem antecedentes criminais e com filhos nascidos nos EUA, eram geralmente detidas por algumas horas na estação da Patrulha de Fronteira, tinham as digitais colhidas e eram mandadas para casa. Essa política era popularmente chamada de “pega e solta” durante o governo Obama – os imigrantes seriam peixes pequenos. Os patrulheiros do DPS exerciam discricionariedade e muitas vezes adotavam a mesma prática permissiva, e por essa razão Ruth costumava receber apenas autuações.</p>\n<p>Em novembro de 2016, logo antes da eleição presidencial, o diretor do DPS Steve McCraw enviou um e-mail aos patrulheiros encerrando a prática do “pega e solta”. “Quando houver causa provável de que alguém tenha atravessado a fronteira de forma irregular”, escreveu, “temos a obrigação de encaminhar esses incidentes à Patrulha de Fronteira dos EUA, ou […] ao Serviço de Imigração e Controle Aduaneiro.”</p>\n<p>Segundo os dados que o DPS forneceu ao senador do Partido Democrata José Rodríguez em abril, entre dezembro de 2015 e outubro de 2016 eram em média 13 encaminhamentos à Patrulha de Fronteira por mês.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Texass-Border-Patrol-1512766079.jpg\"><img alt=\"WESLACO, TX - APRIL 13:  A Border Patrol agent looks for illegal immigrants near the U.S.-Mexico border on April 13, 2016 in Weslaco, Texas.

Pelas estatísticas enviadas a Rodríguez, em dezembro de 2016 ocorreram 40 incidentes assim, comparados a 24 em dezembro de 2015.\n<p>No vídeo de câmera veicular que relembra a abordagem de Ruth Mariel Ramirez por conta de suas janelas, o patrulheiro Korin Hutchisson ordena que Ruth e Mariel Carolina permaneçam no acostamento de uma estrada poeirenta perto da igreja que frequentam. Ele confirma que Ruth não tem habilitação do Texas. Ela mostra a ele uma habilitação mexicana, e o parceiro de Hutchisson, Patrick Brookshier, segura o papel contra a luz. “É falso”, ele diz. Ruth tinha outros documentos, inclusive um título eleitoral do México com seu endereço no Texas, mas os patrulheiros demonstram ter certeza de que ela está se ocultando sob um nome falso.</p>\n<p>Depois que sua filha é mandada para casa, Ruth sua em silêncio sob o sol do deserto por quase uma hora até que um agente da Patrulha de Fronteira chega, olha rapidamente a habilitação, e dá de ombros. “É meio fraco”, ele disse sobre o documento e sobre a insistência dos patrulheiros de que a identidade de Ruth é falsa. Ainda assim, ele a conduz ao veículo da Patrulha de Fronteira. Os patrulheiros especulam que Ruth seja uma grande narcotraficante – “muito cacife”, eles riem – buscando se passar por outra pessoa, “tentando não parecer tão importante” ao dirigir uma caminhonete “surrada”.</p>\n<p>No escritório da Patrulha de Fronteira, segundo Ruth, os patrulheiros tomavam goles de capuccino de loja de conveniência enquanto ela era identificada, de acordo com os registros do juízo de imigração, como sendo exatamente quem ela dizia ser, sem ficha criminal. No entanto, ela foi considerada deportável e enviada para um centro de detenção de imigrantes.</p>\n<p>Hutchisson e Brookshier não se manifestaram quando procurados para comentar, e o Departamento de Segurança Pública do Texas não respondeu aos pedidos para disponibilizá-los para entrevistas.</p>\n<p>A abordagem e a apreensão de Ruth vieram em seguida de outra apreensão feita pelo DPS três semanas antes, 1.300km abaixo de El Paso seguindo o curso do Rio Grande, em Brownsville, em que foi detido um casal com quatro filhos nascidos nos EUA.</p>\n<p>A filmagem do DPS nessa abordagem mostra a patrulheira Mirna Garcia parando Luis e Berta, que pediram que fossem usados pseudônimos para proteger sua família de retaliações. O incidente aconteceu também numa tarde de domingo, quando o casal estava atrasado para a igreja e se apressava para chegar. No vídeo, Gracia orienta Luis a parar o carro no estacionamento de uma loja de conveniência, e então o repreende pela velocidade e pede sua habilitação. Luis não tinha o documento, e Gracia começa a interrogar os dois sobre seu status migratório. Eles dizem que moram há alguns anos em Brownsville e que têm quatro filhos nascidos lá. São provenientes de Matamoros, a cidade mexicana logo depois da fronteira, e costumavam ter vistos de travessia para fazer visitas de compras ao Texas. Desde que se mudaram para Brownsville, no entanto, não tiveram dinheiro para regularizar seus documentos de residência permanente, porque têm um filho doente.</p>\n<p>Gracia vê um agente da Patrulha de Fronteira saindo da loja de conveniência e acena para que ele venha. Ela então diz a Luis e Berta que alguém precisa vir buscar o carro e o filho pequeno do casal, que está no banco da frente. Berta liga para seu filho de 16 anos, Alan, que é capitão do time de futebol da escola onde estuda. Alan chega em minutos, de short e chinelo, e fica em choque.</p>\n<p>“A Patrulha de Fronteira vai levar seu pai”, Gracia diz ao rapaz, em inglês. Ele começa a chorar. “Filho, não chore”, diz Berta em espanhol. Em seguida, diz à patrulheira: “<em>Ayúdenos</em>!” Ajude-nos!</p>\n<p>“<em>Yo estoy haciendo mi trabajo</em>, ma’am”, responde Gracia. Estou só fazendo meu trabalho.</p>\n<p>Sem dinheiro para pagar advogados de imigração, Luis e Berta foram deportados.</p>\n<div>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/rBFqgfNH-O8lzxR7r.html\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Um vídeo de câmera veicular da Patrulha Rodoviária do Texas mostra a patrulheira Mirna Gracia contando ao jovem Alan, de 16 anos, que a Patrulha de Fronteira vai levar seu pai.</p>\n<p>Algumas semanas depois que Luis e Berta foram detidos, Paco e Carlos – que também pediram que seus nomes verdadeiros fossem ocultados em benefício da segurança de suas famílias – foram apreendidos em incidentes separados, com horas de diferença, no mesmo local, perto de McAllen, no Texas. Ambos foram detidos por um patrulheiro sisudo chamado Cristobal Flores, que depois de apenas uma semana destacado para a zona de fronteira já havia capturado quatro pessoas sem documentos, e estava claramente orgulhoso do feito. Uma das mulheres presas por ele contou que havia se mudado para o Texas depois de 17 anos morando em Illinois. Outra já estava no Texas há 15 anos. Outra, ainda, vivia no estado há duas décadas. Algumas semanas depois, Flores capturou mais quatro pessoas na mesma área – incluindo um casal com dois bebês e um homem que estava em um veículo com seu pai, sua esposa e sua filha pequena, todos cidadãos norte-americanos.</p>\n<p>Paco, um vendedor de brinquedos <em>vintage</em>, foi parado por estar em alta velocidade num dia de semana pela manhã, com sua van cheia de mercadorias que ele havia acabado de comprar no atacado. Na filmagem é possível ver e ouvir Flores pedindo a Paco que explique por que não tem habilitação do Texas.</p>\n<p>“¿<em>Por qué</em>?” Flores pergunta a Paco. Por quê?</p>\n<p>Paco tenta exercer seu direito de ficar em silêncio nos termos da Quinta Emenda à Constituição dos EUA, mas Flores não é adepto das liberdades civis. Sua pergunta, que já era ríspida num primeiro momento, com a repetição se torna um grito ameaçador. “¿<em>Por qué</em>? ¿<em>Por qué</em>? ¿<em>POR QUÉ</em>? ¿<em>POR QUÉ</em>?”</p>\n<p>Paco permanece mudo e intimidado, e Flores dá um telefonema em voz baixa usando códigos: “Unidade BP (Border Patrol, a Patrulha de Fronteira), venham aqui. Achei um UDA.” UDA, “undocumented alien”, estrangeiro sem documentos.</p>\n<p>Paco foi mandado para o Centro de Processamento de Port Isabel, uma instituição cercada de arame de concertina e a quilômetros de qualquer cidade, por estradas esburacadas perto do Golfo do México. Os detentos ali não vêm apenas do México, mas também da América Central, da América do Sul, do Haiti e da Eritreia. Pouco depois de Pablo, outro recém-chegado adentra a cela: Carlos, que também havia sido abordado por Flores por trafegar em alta velocidade, logo depois da prisão de Paco.</p>\n<p>O vídeo de Carlos mostra que Flores o tratou de forma educada, mas dissimulada.</p>\n<p>Pela política do DPS, quando os patrulheiros abordam um motorista por infração de trânsito, eles geralmente liberam a pessoa depois de fazê-la assinar uma autuação ou advertência por escrito. (Em outras filmagens, pode-se ouvir patrulheiros discutindo essa prática.) No caso de Carlos, no entanto, a Patrulha de Fronteira demorou a chegar quando acionada por Flores, e os agentes ainda não haviam chegado depois de 15 minutos da abordagem.</p>\n<p>Flores faz Carlos assinar sua autuação, mas diz em espanhol que ele não está liberado: “Estou esperando chegar mais informação.” “Informação”, no caso, eram os agentes da Patrulha de Fronteira, que aparecem em instantes. Eles vão embora levando Carlos. Outro patrulheiro passa pelo local, e bate papo com Flores sobre imigrantes sem documentos. Flores comenta que seria bom ter ajuda para limpar a área para onde está designado: “se pelo menos um desses patrulheiros viesse trabalhar comigo para advertir esse pessoal”.</p>\n<p>“Você acha que o tráfego diminuiria se eu trabalhasse aqui?”, pergunta Flores.</p>\n<p>Os dois riem.</p>\n<p>Quando instado, o Departamento de Segurança Pública do Texas não se manifestou sobre o comportamento verbalmente agressivo de Flores. Flores e Garcia também não deram nenhuma resposta.</p>\n<p>Quando Carlos chegou à prisão de Port Isabel, ele já sabia pelos rumores que escutou no escritório da Patrulha de Fronteira que outra pessoa havia sido detida logo antes, no mesmo lugar, pelo mesmo patrulheiro. Ele chamou na cela até que Paco respondeu que era ele. Como imigrantes viajando nas cobertas inferiores do mesmo navio para a América um século atrás, surgiu uma ligação entre eles, e se tornaram amigos.</p>\n<p>Carlos se lembrava como era a vida do outro lado da fronteira de McAllen em Reynosa, México, antes de emigrar. Lá ele trabalhava 48 horas por semana numa fábrica de propriedade de estrangeiros – uma <em>maquiladora</em> – pelo equivalente a 50 dólares estadunidenses por semana. Todos os dias sua família comia feijão e ovo. Na prisão para imigrantes, o almoço era arroz com feijão e um mini sanduíche. Carlos perdeu quase cinco quilos depois de 23 dias em Port Isabel.</p>\n<p>A “dieta” radical, porém, era suportável. O que incomodava Carlos era não poder trabalhar – e, além disso, não ver sua família. Sua esposa e suas filhas adolescentes não podiam ir vê-lo na prisão porque também não têm documentos. Só o bebê de 18 meses e o garoto de 11 anos no ensino fundamental são cidadãos norte-americanos.</p>\n<p>Logo depois da prisão de Carlos, ninguém contou ao menino de 11 anos que seu pai havia sido levado. A família estava tentando poupá-lo, mas a tentativa só durou alguns dias, até que a criança fosse encarregada de ir à prisão. Um vizinho lhe deu carona até a estrada esburacada, atravessando as barreiras de arame farpado. Ele estacionou e ficou no carro. O menino passou sozinho pelos guardas e pelos detectores de metal; ele e seu pai ficaram separados por um painel de vidro durante a visita. Ambos choravam demais para conseguir conversar muito, mas Carlos prometeu que, quando saísse, iriam juntos ao parque Six Flags em San Antonio.</p>\n<p>O garoto nunca contou a nenhum de seus amigos que o pai estava em um centro de detenção. Até hoje ele ainda não consegue falar sobre isso. Quando o assunto é mencionado, ele fica calado, mas seu rosto treme.</p>\n<p>As famílias de Paco e Carlos conseguiram contratar advogados e tirá-los de Port Isabel sob fiança. No total, Carlos pagou US$10.500 para voltar para casa. Paco pagou US$8.500, em grande parte dinheiro emprestado de parentes. Seu dinheiro até então estava reservado para pagar pela inscrição de sua filha no programa do DACA. Como foi necessário dar outro uso a ele, sua filha de 17 anos, excelente aluna, continua sem documentos.</p>\n<p>Os dois homens agora estão enfronhados em processos, com mais custos, para questionar os esforços do governo de removê-los do país. Levará meses, talvez anos, até que uma decisão seja prolatada. Ambos se fortalecem na fé religiosa pela esperança de resultados favoráveis. Mas ambos sabem que suas chances de permanecerem nos EUA são precárias. Carlos já pensou em se mudar para o Canadá.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Brownsville-Texas-immigration-1512767745.jpg\"><img alt=\"FILE - This June 18, 2014 file photo shows U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents working at a processing facility in Brownsville,Texas.

Luis e Berta, o casal expulso de Brownsville para o México, não tiveram a mesma sorte.</p>\n<p>Por uma semana depois que os dois foram presos, seus filhos, inclusive a estrela do time de futebol do colégio, Alan, de 16 anos, continuaram a morar na mesma casa alugada em Brownsville. Mas logo ficaram sem dinheiro até para o aluguel, e foram despejados. Numa tarde de sexta-feira, as crianças jogaram os móveis de segunda mão da família na rua, colocaram suas roupas em bolsas, e conseguiram carona num caminhão para Matamoros. Eles passaram duas semanas na casa apertada dos avós de Alan num bairro pobre.</p>\n<p>O time de futebol da escola Lopez High School sentiu falta de Alan – sem sua liderança como capitão, o time estava sofrendo sucessivas derrotas. Alan voltou para Brownsville com um dos irmãos, também aluno da mesma escola, e se espremeram com seus tios e vários primos. Alan começou a dormir num quartinho com vários outros parentes em lençóis estendidos no chão. O bairro é apelidado de “<em>Trailitas</em>” – Trailerzinhos – porque boa parte das moradias são antigos trailers. As pessoas pelas ruas são amigáveis, em contraste com os bandos de cães e gatos ferais e magrelos que brigam nos quintais com galos e galinhas muito mais bem nutridos.</p>\n<p>O time de futebol tentou ajudar Alan a sobreviver ao choque de ter se tornado, de uma hora para a outra, quase órfão, pois sempre teve seus pais por perto. Seu treinador, Amadeo Escandón, recebeu um telefonema choroso de Alan no domingo à noite na sequência das prisões. “Eu não sabia o que dizer ao garoto”, declarou Escandón. “Ele estava arrasado.”</p>\n<p>Alan permaneceu em Brownsville e visita seus pais todos os fins de semana em Matamoros, uma cidade tomada pelo Cartel do Golfo. O chefe de polícia de Brownsville havia recomendado extremo cuidado ao visitar Matamoros, depois que uma adolescente foi morta num shopping em um tiroteio entre cartéis em 2016. Nos últimos tempos, Alan parece derrotado e magro. Ele perdeu peso. Seu último ano do ensino médio começou no segundo semestre, e os treinadores estão se esforçando para conseguir uma bolsa de atleta para que ele possa ir à universidade. Ele está determinado a permanecer nos Estados Unidos: “é meu país”, diz ele. “Eu nasci aqui.”</p>\n<p>Em Ciudad Juárez, atravessando a fronteira internacional de El Paso, os quatro filhos de Ruth Mariel Ramirez não sabem mais com certeza se têm um país.</p>\n<p>Ruth passou quase dois meses na prisão para imigrantes até concordar com uma “saída voluntária” dos Estados Unidos – um arranjo que deixa a ela a possibilidade de retornar ao país no futuro. Ela disse que aceitou o acordo porque estava exausta. Passou semanas comendo a gororoba nojenta do centro de detençao: a lasanha quase podre tinha baratas no meio, e ela achou bichos no bolo de banana.</p>\n<p>Muito pior do que a comida da prisão, no entanto, era a situação de seus filhos em casa. A mãe e a irmã de Ruth estavam tentando cuidar das crianças, mas apesar desses cuidados elas estavam afundando acadêmica e emocionalmente.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">“Era tudo muito estranho”, contou Brayan. “Eu não me sentia bem por dentro. Parei de comer e comecei a só dormir.”</blockquote>\n<p>Brayan foi provavelmente quem ficou pior. Ele é muito próximo de sua mãe. “Ela que sempre esteve comigo”, ele disse. “Com ela me sinto super confiante. Sempre que eu voltava de um jogo de futebol americano, ia contar a ela o que tinha feito de bom ou ruim. Ela sempre perguntava do meu dia. E aí não tinha mais ninguém para conversar.” Segundo a irmã de Brayan, Mariel Carolina, com o súbito desaparecimento da mãe a casa se tornou silenciosa, porque cada um se recolhia ao seu quarto para chorar na privacidade. Parecia que alguém tinha morrido, ela lembra.</p>\n<p>“Era tudo muito estranho”, contou Brayan. “Eu não me sentia bem por dentro. Parei de comer e comecei a só dormir. Quando não estava dormindo, passava as noites em claro chorando. Durante o dia na escola, “eu só abaixava a cabeça e colocava os fones de ouvido”, disse ele. Até então um bom aluno, ele parou de fazer suas tarefas e passou a confrontar seus professores, a quem pouco dizia sobre o que havia acontecido com sua mãe. Depois de algumas semanas assim, foi suspenso, e então expulso. Ele foi reprovado no nono ano.</p>\n<p>A única válvula de escape de Brayan eram os dois raps sobre Ruth que ele compôs e cantava. Um deles, intitulado “<em>Soledad</em>” – solidão – se dirige em espanhol à mãe e a Deus. <em>Eu preciso do seu amor. Preciso de você do meu lado. Por favor, Deus.</em></p>\n<p>Brayan publicou as músicas no Facebook e pediu a todos para “curtir”. Ele também postou: “quero me matar”. Assustados, alguns familiares avisaram Ruth. Ela sabia que precisava voltar para perto do filho, mesmo que isso significasse que ambos seriam banidos do país.</p>\n<p>Segundo Ruth, ela pensara que seu acordo de “saída voluntária” incluiria voltar ao México pela ponte que liga seus dois mundos, El Paso e Juárez. Qual não foi sua surpresa ao ser embarcada num ônibus no meio da noite com outros detentos, e conduzida por horas na escuridão. “Com licença, para onde estamos indo?”, ela perguntou ao motorista. “Não sei”, ele respondeu. “Como assim, você não sabe?”  “Eles vão jogar vocês de volta em Coahuila”, ele disse. “O que é Coahuila?”, ela perguntou. “É no México”, ele riu.</p>\n<p>“Estou com medo”, ela disse aos carcereiros que estavam com ela no ônibus. “Não sei nada sobre esse lugar, estou sem meu telefone, não tenho dinheiro – o que vou fazer?” “Isso é problema seu”, disseram primeiro a ela, e “para fora!” quando mandaram que ela descesse do ônibus sobre uma ponte internacional no meio da noite e andasse para o sul. Ela tinha bons motivos para estar com medo: o Departamento de Estados dos EUA emitiu um alerta de viagem aconselhando os cidadãos norte-americanos a evitarem o estado mexicano de Coahuila em razão dos altos índices de violência, especialmente perto da fronteira. Autoridades mexicanas permitiram a ela uma ligação gratuita para seu parceiro, Jaime, que estava transtornado por não fazer ideia de seu paradeiro. Ela conseguiu dinheiro para comprar uma passagem de ônibus para Juárez.</p>\n<p>Chegando lá, ela instruiu todos os seus filhos a irem embora do Texas e se juntarem a ela do outro lado da fronteira, embora três deles sejam cidadãos americanos. “Sou a mãe deles”, ela explicou. “Eles precisam da mãe. Não posso deixá-los com pessoas que não se importam de verdade com eles.”</p>\n<p>Mariel Carolina, Alexander e Oscar podem voltar para El Paso quando estiverem mais velhos. Brayan não tem essa possibilidade. Embora seja culturalmente norte-americano, sua nacionalidade é mexicana, e ele não tem documentos de imigração que lhe permitam permanecer nos EUA. Ruth sabia que a ida de Brayan para Juárez significava não só que ele teria que desistir de se beneficiar do DACA, mas que também poderia nunca mais conseguir entrar nos Estados Unidos.</p>\n<p>Quando Brayan atravessou de El Paso para Juárez “ele só chorava”, recorda Ruth. Ele não tinha lembranças da sua cidade natal, nem qualquer familiaridade com aquela pobreza árida e palpável. “Ele olhava para as ruas”, conta Ruth, “e colocava as mãos na cabeça”. Mas ele não se matou.</p>\n<p>A própria Ruth está passando por algo novo: um tratamento contra depressão e ansiedade em resultado de suas experiências. As crianças também estão sofrendo. “Sentimos que não estamos vivendo, estamos sobrevivendo”, diz ela. Um dos problemas de seus filhos é a frustração com sua nacionalidade e com a forma como terão que lidar com sua cidadania quando se tornarem adultos.</p>\n<p>“Minha filha disse que não quer ir para os EUA”, conta Ruth, “porque se o país não me quer, não os quer também.”</p>\n<p>O país definitivamente não quer Brayan, e a família está preocupada com ele.</p>\n<p>Atualmente com 16 anos, ele está tendo muita dificuldade com a escola em Juárez, principalmente porque não sabe escrever em espanhol. Ele fala que quer abandonar a escola. Ruth diz a ele que, se conseguir se formar, ela vai permitir que ele continue investindo no rap. “É o que eu planejo fazer no meu futuro”, diz Brayan. Ele está cheio de uma arrogância desesperada. Diz que no ano que vem vai ficar famoso.</p>\n<p>Mas os sonhos de Brayan, tão possíveis e benignos no Texas, são frágeis e sombrios no México. Em El Paso, ele tinha um amigo com quem ia começar a gravar músicas profissionalmente. Em Juárez, fez contato com uma pessoa que tem um estúdio. O estúdio, porém, fica “perto da casa da minha avó”, diz ele, e “no bairro da minha avó há muitas drogas e prostitutas”. Brayan nunca teve problemas com drogas no Texas. Agora, porém, no ambiente confuso e perigoso de Juárez, sua irmã diz que “ele poderia mudar muito rapidamente”.</p>\n<p>Ainda assim, a família está feliz por estar novamente reunida. Ruth diz que não guarda mágoa contra o país que a expulsou. “Eu amo muito os Estados Unidos. É onde meus filhos nasceram. É onde estudei. O país me ensinou muitas coisas.” Ela culpa os patrulheiros do DPS por destruir as vidas da sua família, principalmente quando assiste ao vídeo de sua abordagem, onde os patrulheiros Patrick Brookshier e Korin Hutchisson falam sobre os os “estrangeiros ilegais” que estão capturando, como se trabalhassem com controle de pragas. Brookshier: “Eles estão saindo da toca agora.” Hutchisson: “É o que estou te dizendo, cara. Eu atraio esse pessoal!”</p>\n<p>Ruth considera que os patrulheiros brincaram com ela de forma cruel, por pura diversão, como cães destruindo um brinquedo de morder. Os Estados Unidos, para ela, “não têm culpa por cachorros como eles”.</p>\n<p>Os Estados Unidos talvez não tenham culpa, mas o estado do Texas certamente tem. O manual dos patrulheiros rodoviários estaduais determina que eles devem chamar a Patrulha de Fronteira se suspeitarem que alguém abordado por uma infração de trânsito esteja no país sem autorização. O manual, porém, não diz nada sobre interrogatório de passageiros, e expressamente proíbe executar as leis de imigração de forma independente; os patrulheiros são instruídos a não deter ninguém com base apenas em suspeitas sobre seu status migratório. E, no entanto, The Intercept obteve um vídeo de câmera veicular de um patrulheiro abordando pedestres e chamando a Patrulha de Fronteira.</p>\n<p>O DPS alega não saber quando os pedestres teriam sido abordados, quem seria o patrulheiro, por que motivo teria feito a abordagem, e nem mesmo onde isso teria acontecido – embora The Intercept tenha conseguido identificar o local como uma rua perto de Laredo. Molly Cost, do departamento de acesso à informação do DPS, diz que sua repartição não sabe quem enviou o vídeo a The Intercept. A completa perplexidade do órgão diante desse vídeo permite concluir que a agência não sabe quantas abordagens, nem quantos encaminhamentos à Patrulha de Fronteira seus agentes efetivamente praticam, e tampouco se essas abordagens são no mínimo constitucionais.</p>\n<p>No começo do ano o Texas aprovou o projeto de lei nº 4 do Senado Estadual – conhecido como “SB4″ (Senate Bill 4), a lei de “mostre seus documentos” – embora partes da lei tenham sido barradas na justiça federal. A SB4 encoraja praticamente todos os agentes com poder de polícia no estado, incluindo agentes de policiamento de rua, delegados e comandantes, a interrogar as pessoas sobre seu status migratório durante abordagens relativas a outros assuntos, e a chamar os agentes de imigração.</p>\n<p>Muitos policiais vão preferir não fazer essas perguntas. Outros, como a patrulheira do DPS Mirna Gracia em Brownsville, vão apenas “fazer seu trabalho”. E um número incerto, à semelhança dos patrulheiros Cristobal Flores no Vale do Rio Grande e Hutchisson e Brookshier em El Paso, vão adorar a função, e mandar mais texanos para o sistema de deportação que se torna cada vez maior e mais destrutivo.</p>\n<p><em>Esse projeto foi apoiado pela organização jornalística sem fins lucrativos </em><a href=\"http://economichardship.org/\"><em>Economic Hardship Reporting Project</em></a><em> (Programa de Reportagens sobre Dificuldades Econômicas).</em></p>\n<p><em>Tradução: Deborah Leão</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/02/texas-imigrantes-familia-video/\">“Eles estão levando todo mundo” — Texas usa pequenas infrações no trânsito para deportar imigrantes dos EUA</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Her death was a horrible cap to an unimaginably hard year. Erica was my friend. I trusted her. She was as honest and authentic of a person as you’ll ever encounter on this earth. She spoke of truth to power as a daily discipline and refused to suffer fools gladly. It’s in the shadows of her untimely death that I look forward into 2018, trying to imagine what’s ahead.</p>\n<p>It might be better to start with what is not going to happen in 2018.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not going to be impeached. Period. First and foremost, no matter what Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation finds, Republicans will continue to control Congress at least until January 2019. Between now and then, even if Democrats have landslide victories in the midterm elections, the current Republicans in Congress will not impeach Trump. They are in too deep with him; they’ve hitched their wagons to his legacy and leadership. Even if the Mueller investigation charges someone in Trump’s inner circle with obstruction of justice or some crime related to collusion with an foreign government, Trump would never resign under any circumstances. All of this to say that 2018 will be another year with Trump in office, and expecting otherwise is futile.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"> After you get your ass handed to you, you can either go back with the same game plan and keep losing, or you can rethink everything, regroup, and go back to the fight.</blockquote>\n<p><u>Yet there is</u> room for some victories, and here’s what I do expect to happen in 2018:</p>\n<p>2018 is going to be a year of successful organizing. After you get your ass handed to you, you can either go back with the same game plan and keep losing, or you can rethink everything, regroup, and go back to the fight with a better chance of success. That’s one lesson we need to take from Erica: organize, organize, organize. There’s no substitute for making it happen by showing up and being there and doing the work, especially in the face of adversity.</p>\n<p>If we do all that, 2018 will be the year of better plans, better actions. A lot of losses accumulated on the <a href=\"https://injusticetoday.com/the-top-criminal-justice-wins-of-2017-6bbe0597b8e1\">criminal justice reform</a> front in 2017, but every win — ranging from essential juvenile justice breakthroughs to more widespread legalization and decriminalization of marijuana — was hard-fought and well-organized. A few reform-minded district attorneys were elected in 2017, and with the skills and understanding gained from those elections, hundreds of additional district attorney races that have been historically ignored will now be in play in 2018 and beyond.</p>\n<p>On Monday, January 1, recreational marijuana <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/30/california-legalise-cannabis-hippy-dream-billion-dollar-industry\">becomes legal in California</a>. This breakthrough cannot be understated. The impact this will have on California’s justice system and economy is massive. California is a pace car for much of the U.S. As other states see the benefits, 2018 will be the year when a record number of cities and states begin to follow suit, either by enacting reforms or putting in place the mechanisms to consider it. (Speaking of California, the state will also make meaningful progress on extending universal health care.)</p>\n<p>Legalizing pot will mean that, in 2018, we will see a growing movement to expunge the criminal records of those convicted of marijuana-related crimes in California and beyond. We will also see breakthroughs on the restoration of voting rights for formerly incarcerated people all over the country.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are going to see record-setting voter turnout all over the country in 2018 for important midterm elections. It will rival or top that of previous presidential elections. That trend will continue in 2019 and 2020, and will indeed lead Democrats and progressives <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/barack-obama-won-the-white-house-but-democrats-lost-the-country/\">to begin regaining</a> power.</p>\n<p>There’s work to do; none of it will come easy. But if we make the effort, we can expect this and more. We can find our way to progress.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Erica Garner, who passed away in late December 2017, holds back tears while speaking to the media after leading a march on Dec. 11, 2014 of people protesting the Staten Island, N.Y., grand jury’s decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of her father, Eric Garner, in July 2014.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/01/2018-progress-erica-garner-midterms-progress/\">We Lost a Lot in 2017.

        "content": "<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">V</span><u>eteran CIA officer</u> Cleveland Cram was nearing the end of his career in 1978, when his superiors in the agency’s directorate of operations handed him a sensitive assignment: Write a history of the agency’s Counterintelligence Staff. Cram, then 61, was well qualified for the task. He had a master’s and Ph.D. in European History from Harvard. He had served two decades in the clandestine service, including nine years as deputy chief of the CIA’s station in London. He knew the senior officialdom of MI-5 and MI-6, the British equivalents of the FBI and CIA, the agency’s closest partners in countering the KGB, the Soviet Union’s effective and ruthless intelligence service.</p>\n<p>Cram was assigned to investigate a debacle. The Counterintelligence Staff, created in 1954, had been headed for 20 years by James Jesus Angleton, a legendary spy who deployed the techniques of literary criticism learned at Yale to find deep patterns and hidden meanings in the records of KGB operations against the West. But Angleton was also a dogmatic and conspiratorial operator whose idiosyncratic theories paralyzed the agency’s operations against the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, and whose domestic surveillance operations targeting American dissidents had discredited the CIA in the court of public opinion.</p>\n<p>In December 1974, CIA Director William Colby fired Angleton after the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/huge-cia-operation-reported-in-u-s-against-antiwar-forces-other.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> revealed the then-unknown counterintelligence chief had overseen a massive program to spy on Americans involved in anti-war and black nationalist movements, a violation of the CIA’s charter. Coming four months after the resignation of Richard Nixon, Angleton’s fall was the denouement of the Watergate scandal, propelling Congress to probe the CIA for the first time. A Senate investigation, headed by Sen. Frank Church, exposed a series of other abuses: assassination conspiracies, unauthorized mail opening, collaboration with human rights abusers, infiltration of news organizations, and the MKULTRA mind-control experiments to develop drugs for use in espionage.</p>\n<p>The exposure of Angleton’s operations set off a political avalanche that engulfed the agency in 1975 and after. The post-Watergate Congress established the House and Senate intelligence committees to oversee covert operations. The passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act required the CIA to obtain warrants to spy on Americans. And for the first time since 1947, the agency’s annual appropriation was slashed.</p>\n<p>Cram’s mission — and he chose to accept it — was to soberly answer the questions that senior CIA officials were asking in their private moments: What in the name of God and national security had Jim Angleton been doing when he ran the Counterintelligence Staff from 1954 to 1974? Did his operations serve the agency’s mission? Did they serve the country?</p>\n<p>With his porkpie hat and trenchcoat, the portly Cram bore a passing resemblance to George Smiley, the fictional British spymaster as played by Alec Guinness in the BBC’s production of John le Carré’s classic “Smiley’s People<em>.</em>” There was some professional similarity as well. In le Carré’s novels, Smiley is introduced as a veteran counterintelligence officer called on by his superiors to assess a covert operation gone disastrously wrong. He is drawn into a hunt for a mole in the British intelligence service.</p>\n<p>Cram’s task in 1978 was to investigate a covert career that culminated in a disastrous mole hunt. Like Smiley, Cram was a connoisseur of files, their connections and implications, their deceptions and omissions. Like Smiley, he embarked on a Cold War espionage odyssey that would fill more than a few volumes.</p>\n<p>When Cram took the assignment, he thought his history of the Counterintelligence Staff would take a year to write. It took six. By 1984, Cram had produced 12 legal-sized volumes about Angleton’s reign as a spymaster, each running 300 to 400 pages — a veritable encyclopedia of U.S. counterintelligence that has never before been made public. With professional thoroughness, Cram plumbed the depths of a deep state archive and returned with a story of madness that the CIA prefers to keep hidden, even 40 years later.</p>\n<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">L</span><u>ast June,</u> I received a phone call from a Los Angeles area code. Half expecting a robocall, I tapped the green icon.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard you are interested in a man named Cleve Cram,” the caller said in a British accent. “Is that so?”</p>\n<p>Was I ever. I had just sent in final changes to the manuscript of “The Ghost,” my biography of Angleton. I thought of Cleve Cram the way a fisherman thinks of the Big One that got away. I had focused on Cram in 2015, as soon as I started to research “The Ghost<em>.</em>” He had written <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/U-Oct%20%201993-%20Of%20Moles%20-%20Molehunters%20-%20A%20Review%20of%20Counterintelligence%20Literature-%201977-92%20-v2.pdf\">an article, published in an open-source CIA journal</a>, about the literature of counterintelligence, which gave some insight into his classified conclusions about Angleton. To learn more, I sought out his personal papers, more than a dozen cartons of correspondence and other documents that his family had donated to Georgetown University Library after his death in 1999. The library’s finding aid indicated that the bequest contained a wealth of material on Angleton.</p>\n<p>But I was too late. The CIA had quietly re-possessed Cram’s papers in 2014. I was told that representatives of the agency had informed the library that the CIA needed to review the material for classified information. All that had been publicly available vanished into the CIA’s archives. By withdrawing the Cram papers from view, the agency effectively shaped my narrative of Angleton’s career. Without Cram’s well-informed perspective, my account of Angleton would necessarily be less precise and probably less critical. I <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/04/25/how-the-cia-writes-history/\">wrote about the experience</a> for The Intercept in April 2016.</p>\n<p>The caller said his name was William Tyrer. He had read my article. He told me he had visited the Georgetown library a few years earlier, while developing a screenplay about a mole in Britain’s MI-5. He had gone through the Cram papers, photographed several hundred pages of material, and become fascinated by the man. “He’s like an American George Smiley, no?” Tyrer said.</p>\n<p>I agreed and said I would be most interested to see what he had found. He questioned me closely about my views on Angleton, Cram, and the CIA, and said he would be in touch. A quick web search revealed that Tyrer is a British-American movie producer, the man behind “Memento,” a brilliant and unforgettable backward-running thriller, the cult favorite “Donnie Darko,” and scores of other movies. He was a serious man and a credible source. A few days later, Tyrer started emailing me 50 pages of material about Angleton that he had found in Cram’s personal papers.</p>\n<p>The Cleveland Cram File, portions of which are published here for the first time, contains a sample of the primary source materials that the veteran CIA official used to write his Angleton study. The documents were photographed in Georgetown University’s Booth Family Center for Special Collections. A Georgetown archivist did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment; the CIA also declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The Cram file illuminates a pregnant moment in the history of America’s secret government, when the CIA began to reckon with the legacy of James Angleton, a founding father of the deep state, a master of mass surveillance, a conspiracy theorist with state power.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/WEB-GettyImages-82619108-1514393517.jpg\"><img alt=\"Chief Soviet delegate Semyon Tsarapkin (centre) and colleague Yuri Nosenko (1927 - 2008, right) at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, February 1964.

Angleton insisted the men’s conflicting stories had enormous implications for U.S. presidents and policymakers, and indeed for U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. For the CIA, the question was, which defector was the more reliable source?</p>\n<p>Anatoly Golitsyn, the chief of the KGB station in Finland, bolted to the West in December 1961. He was a heavyset man with hazel eyes and a methodical and manipulative mind. Yuri Nosenko, a career KGB officer embedded in the Soviet delegation to a U.N. disarmament conference in Geneva, started selling information to the Americans in June 1962 to pay back official funds blown in the company of dubious women. Eighteen months later, he approached the CIA and struck a deal to defect in return for a $50,000 cash payment. Among other things, Nosenko had firsthand knowledge that the KGB had not recruited accused presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald when he lived in the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1962.</p>\n<p>Golitsyn, resettled in upstate New York by the CIA, convinced Angleton that Nosenko was a false defector sent by the KGB. Under Golitsyn’s influence, Angleton came to believe that in 1959, the KGB had launched a massive deception operation designed to lull the U.S. government into believing Soviet propaganda about “peaceful coexistence” between capitalism and communism, with the goal of prevailing over the complacent West.</p>\n<p>Nosenko’s purpose, Golitsyn said, was to protect a Soviet “mole” already working inside CIA headquarters. “He is a provocateur, who is on a mission for the KGB,” Golitsyn told Angleton, according to a memo found in the agency’s declassified <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/crest-25-year-program-archive\">online database known as CREST</a>, or the CIA Records Search Tool. “He was introduced to your agency as a double agent in Geneva in 1962. During all the time until now he has been fulfilling a KGB mission against your country.”</p>\n<p>Angleton reneged on the payment and ordered that Nosenko be held in what would now be known as a “black site,” a secret CIA detention facility in southern Maryland. Nosenko was not tortured, but he was fed a minimal diet, denied all possessions, and, he said later, dosed with LSD. He was held in solitary confinement for the next four years, all the while protesting his innocence.</p>\n<p>In 1968, Angleton lost out to the institutional consensus within the agency that Nosenko was in fact a bona fide defector. Nosenko was released from solitary confinement and the CIA resettled him in suburban Washington, D.C. Nothing he did in his retirement supported the idea that the KGB had sent him or that he knew of a mole inside the CIA.</p>\n<p>A few years later, Cram was faced with a simple but important question: Had Angleton been right to incarcerate Nosenko?</p>\n<p>To answer it, Cram relied in part on a secret CIA history titled “The Monster Plot,” written by John Hart, a career officer in the Soviet Russia division who had previously studied the Nosenko case on behalf of CIA Director Richard Helms. “<a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10534-10205.pdf\">The Monster Plot</a>,” which runs to more than 180 pages, was declassified with a batch of JFK assassination files in November; Cram kept a copy in his personal papers.</p>\n<p>The introduction and conclusion of “The Monster Plot,” photographed by Tyrer in the Georgetown collection, detail how legitimate concerns about Soviet penetration of the CIA blossomed into Angleton’s certainty that a giant KGB deception operation was undermining the West. The history’s title referred to the massive size of the suspected Soviet “plot” that Angleton and others feared was unfolding within the CIA.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/WEB-GettyImages-505808502-1514393529.jpg\"><img alt=\"Harold 'Kim' Philby, former First Secretary of the British Embassy in Washington, at a press conference in response to his involvement with defected diplomats Burgess and McLean, at his brother's home in Drayton Gardens, London, November 8th 1955.

Wilds/Keystone/Getty Images</p></div>Angleton was well acquainted with Soviet treachery. His best friend in British intelligence was Kim Philby, with whom he shared many a secret over liquid lunches in Washington. In 1951, Philby was expelled from the United States on the wholly justified suspicion that he was a Soviet spy. He later turned up in Moscow and became a general in the KGB.\n<p>After Philby’s betrayal, Angleton and other CIA officials worried that another communist mole might still be working the agency, a theory that seemed to be borne out nearly a decade later, when the CIA began losing a string of spies inside the Soviet Union. In October 1959, Petr Popov, a Soviet military intelligence officer who had been passing secrets to the Americans for seven years, vanished. A few months later, it emerged that he had been arrested, which “added a specific problem to the general concerns about the possibility the CIA was penetrated,” wrote Hart.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/WEB-GettyImages-630674652-1514393531.jpg\"><img alt=\"Soviet military intelligence colonel Oleg Penkovsky (C) was sentenced to death during his public trial on May 11, 1963 in Moscow.  / AFP / TASS / -        (Photo credit should read -/AFP/Getty Images)\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/WEB-GettyImages-630674652-1514393531.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164191\"></a>\n<p>Soviet Military Intelligence Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, center, was sentenced to death during his public trial on May 11, 1963, in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Photo: AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>In 1961, the CIA began receiving anonymous letters warning that Western intelligence agencies — but not the agency itself — had been penetrated. The information in the letters was considered genuine because it led to the arrest of Soviet spies in the upper ranks of the British and German intelligence services. A year later, Oleg Penkovsky, a British spy in Soviet military intelligence who had given the U.S. information of “great strategic importance,” was arrested.</p>\n<p>Angleton suspected the worst, and he found Golitsyn’s explanation persuasive. All the Soviet defectors who came after Golitsyn’s arrival in late 1961, including Nosenko, were phonies, Golitsyn said. They had been dispatched with false information to discredit Golitsyn, to protect KGB moles already in place, and to confuse U.S. policymakers about Moscow’s intentions. Hart noted that when Golitsyn “stressed themes of KGB ‘disinformation’ (<em>dezinformatsiya</em>) and extensive (but initially unspecified) staff penetration of the Western services, he found a willing and eager audience” in Angleton.</p>\n<p>Golitsyn couldn’t have known how ready Angleton was to believe him when it came to Soviet disinformation, for Angleton had learned firsthand how strategic deception operations could influence the course of history. As a young intelligence officer in World War II, he was cleared for the ULTRA operation, in which British intelligence fed false information to the German High Command. Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower both believed the ULTRA operation gave the Allies a decisive advantage over the Germans, and so did Angleton.</p>\n<p>The Soviets’ goal, Golitsyn said, was to dupe the West into believing that a schism was developing between the Soviet Union and its longtime ally China in the late 1950s. On the surface, at least, there were ample indications of a split. When Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s tyranny in 1956, the Chinese communists turned hostile to Moscow, issuing bitter demarches about the correct course of communism and launching border skirmishes over obscure territorial disputes. But Golitsyn didn’t buy it. According to Hart, the defector “was certain” the purported distance between the two powers “was the clever product of KGB disinformation.”</p>\n<p>Angleton was persuaded, viewing the public Sino-Soviet conflict as part of a KGB deception operation designed to persuade the West that the communist world was divided, Hart wrote. If the deception succeeded — that is, if the CIA believed it — it would undermine the U.S.’s commitment to a firm policy of containing Soviet power, Angleton thought. Hart concluded that Angleton had set out to break Nosenko before ascertaining the facts.</p>\n<p>“There was never an honest effort at the time to establish NOSENKO’s bona fides,” Hart wrote. “There was only a determined effort to prove NOSENKO was mala fide, and part of a KGB deception operation meant to mislead the CIA into believing it was not penetrated.”</p>\n<p>In his report, Hart affirmed the agency’s 1968 finding, reached over Angleton’s bitter objections, that Nosenko was a genuine defector. Not for the first or last time, a self-serving informant had used the agency’s ideological preconceptions to manipulate it to his own ends. Angleton’s handling of Nosenko “did not conform to any generally accepted sense of the term ‘methodology,’” Hart wrote. In his recommendations, he called for more rigorous psychological assessment of defectors and “improvement of intellectual standards” in the clandestine service.</p>\n<p>Cram agreed. In a summary of his assessment of the Nosenko case, published in a 1993 monograph for the CIA’s Center for the Study of Intelligence titled “<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/U-Oct%20%201993-%20Of%20Moles%20-%20Molehunters%20-%20A%20Review%20of%20Counterintelligence%20Literature-%201977-92%20-v2.pdf\">Of Moles and Molehunters</a>,” he concluded Angleton was wrong about Nosenko. The excerpts from Cram’s papers reveal the classified information on which he based his conclusion.</p>\n<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">A</span><u>s Cram delved</u> into Angleton’s records, he received a signed memo, included in the Georgetown collection, from a branch chief in the Soviet Russia division named “Miles.” Miles explained that in the mid-1960s, he had served on a CIA team code-named AESAWDUST that sought to vindicate Angleton’s theory of false defectors and strategic disinformation. (All CIA operations involving the Soviet Union were identified by the diagraph AE, followed by a randomly selected code name.)</p>\n<p>With the benefit of hindsight, Miles admitted that groupthink had distorted his work. “The AESAWDUSTERS were convinced people (I ought to know, I was one of them), and they were very impatient with anyone who disagreed with them or were critical [sic], often snapping back that the critic did not have all the information they had, so didn’t know what he was talking about,” he wrote. “Convinced participating AESAWDUST members were terribly concerned and motivated by fear that until this vast deception complex was exposed and countered, we would be in bad trouble which could get worse at any moment.”</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=164317\"></div>\n\n<p>The sheer enormity of Angleton’s “Monster Plot” theory convinced its advocates that it must be true, Miles wrote. But a counterintelligence theory that explained everything was suspect. The mass of cases “tossed into the boiling pot grew and grew, until outsiders simply could no longer swallow the idea that all [Soviet defectors] were bad,” Miles wrote. “Sooner or later those not bound up in the mission said ‘Hold it, Wait a minute! Maybe NOSENKO [was a fake defector], maybe some [double agent] cases, maybe even a few more, but almost <em>all</em>? Too much.’”</p>\n<p>“Simple passage of time has proven that AESAWDUST was wrong,” Miles continued. “The idea was that NOSENKO would not have been sent unless the goals of the KGB were truly major. These were postulated as negating GOLITSYN’s information (which NOSENKO never did, nor do I believe he could have); then to protect sources the KGB had in place in the USG and CIA (none discovered despite marathon effort); and finally to destroying CIA itself.”</p>\n<p>The CIA had indeed “gone downhill” in the 1970s, Miles noted, but he attributed that decline to sensational revelations of CIA abuses in the press and the cultural changes wrought by the 1960s, not KGB deception operations. “Nothing has turned out as AESAWDUST predicted,” Miles concluded.</p>\n<p>Even Angleton’s original supporters eventually became disenchanted with the rigidity of his thinking. Such testimony fortified Cram’s findings about Angleton and clarified the fate of another one of his victims, James Leslie Bennett, chief of counterintelligence for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>\n<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">I</span><u>n the course</u> of his inquiry, Cram heard from a counterintelligence officer with the initials “PTD” who seems to have known about the origins of Angleton’s investigation of Bennett.</p>\n<p>PTD sent Cram a one-page memo on “The Bennett Case,” which was included in the Georgetown collection and photographed by Tyrer. It was a damning account of Angleton’s methods and his misguided reliance on Anatoly Golitsyn.</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=164318\"></div>\n\n<p>The Bennett Case began in 1970, when senior Canadian intelligence officers became convinced, correctly, that there was a communist spy working inside their headquarters. Because the CIA worked closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, known as the RCMP, Angleton was concerned, too. He consulted with Bennett, his Canadian counterpart, an intellectual whose headstrong opinions were not always appreciated by his more provincial colleagues. But Angleton liked Bennett, according to PTD. Angleton “never thought of Bennett as a spy and in fact was very high on him as a pro among cowboys,” PTD wrote. Angleton even gave a “tongue-lashing” to a colleague who suggested Bennett might be working for the Soviets.</p>\n<p>One of the Canadian officials who clashed with Bennett came to Washington in the summer of 1970 for “long discussions of penetration of RCMP by [Russian Intelligence Service] and probable Bennett role,” PTD recalled.</p>\n<p>After defending Bennett, Angleton asked Golitsyn to analyze the case. “In early 1972 Golitsyn was given RCMP files to peruse about the supposed RIS penetration,” PTD recalled. In his report, Golitsyn wrote down three names of Canadian officials, one of whom was Bennett. “After pondering some he decided Bennett was the penetration.”</p>\n<p>Angleton was suddenly persuaded. “JJA forced Golitsyn on the RCMP for this purpose of supposedly aiding them in the investigation,” PTD wrote, using Angleton’s initials. “And all through the case, JJA kept up an unrelenting pressure on the RCMP … to push Bennett out.”</p>\n<p>Bennett protested his innocence and took a polygraph test to prove it. The exam “showed him to be a strong reactor on certain subjects not related to the investigation,” PTD reported. “But when queried whether he was working for an adversary service (and they tried them all), there was no response.”</p>\n<p>When a CIA polygraph security officer looked at the results, PTD wrote, “he concluded Bennett had passed the test.” By then Bennett had already been forced to retire.</p>\n<p>As first reported in “Cold Warrior<em>,</em>” Tom Mangold’s 1993 book about Angleton’s mole hunt, Bennett left intelligence work under a cloud of undeserved suspicion. He got divorced and moved to Australia. The Canadians eventually caught a Russian spy in their midst who had nothing to do with Bennett. In 1993, the Canadian government cleared Bennett of any wrongdoing and gave him $150,000 Canadian in compensation, <a href=\"http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930815&slug=1716072\">according to journalist David Wise</a>.</p>\n<p>To Cram, PTD’s account showed that Angleton had acted on Golitsyn’s whim, misinterpreted the polygraph results, and ruined a man’s career on the slenderest of suppositions.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/WEB-BW-GettyImages-112204327-1514393526.jpg\"><img alt=\"HANDOUT PHOTO: Edward Petty, a Central Intelligence Agency officer whose career ended after he accused his boss, longtime chief spycatcher James J.

After years of unsuccessful mole hunting, Petty became convinced that the mole must be working on Angleton’s staff. First, Petty wrongly suspected Angleton’s longtime deputy, Newton “Scottie” Miler, and later Pete Bagley, chief of counterintelligence for the Soviet Division, who didn’t actually work for Angleton but was, in Cram’s estimation, “wholly under Angleton’s domination.”</p>\n<p>Petty had also spoken to two reporters, David Martin, a defense correspondent for Newsweek, and David Ignatius, then a reporter for the Wall Street Journal<em>.</em> Both had written glancingly about the astonishing-if-true allegation that Angleton was suspected of being the mole, and were trying to confirm it with sources inside the agency.</p>\n<p>In a four-hour interview with Cram, Petty gave a more detailed version of the story he had told Martin and Ignatius. He said that he had written up his suspicions of Bagley in a memo and sent it to Angleton at some point in the late 1960s. Several months later, during a long conversation about something else, Angleton suddenly said, “Bagley is not a spy.”</p>\n<p>That blanket denial, Petty said, set him wondering what made Angleton so sure. Could it be that Angleton was himself the mole? Cram thought it unlikely that Petty was alone in his suspicions, “for there were many who regarded Angleton as sinister,” he observed in his memo about the interview, which was included in the Georgetown collection.</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=164308\"></div>\n\n<p>Petty said he recorded 30 hours of commentary in which he outlined the various “litmus tests” he had run on Angleton to see if he was a KGB spy. His reasoning might have been called “Angletonian.” Assuming the CIA had been penetrated at a high level, Petty considered the possibility that both Anatoly Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko had been sent by the KGB under the guidance of the real mole, Angleton himself. Through this analytical lens, Petty saw new meaning in the anomalies of Angleton’s career: his friendship with Kim Philby; his faith in Golitsyn; his insistence that the Sino-Soviet split was a ruse. Every decision he made seemed to impede U.S. intelligence operations, Petty noted. Perhaps it was intentional.</p>\n<p>Cram’s account of the interview makes clear that Petty had no solid evidence to support his musings. Petty specialized in “airy theorizing,” Cram wrote later, favoring “extreme speculation unsupported by facts.”</p>\n<p>There was — and is — no evidence that Angleton was a spy for the KGB. Given Angleton’s staunch anti-communism, the notion is close to absurd. Petty’s accusation is most significant as evidence for Cram and the CIA leadership that Angleton’s theory and practice of counterintelligence were deeply flawed.</p>\n<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">I</span><u>f Angleton</u> wasn’t working for the Soviets, what could account for his folly?</p>\n<p>Among the papers Cram reviewed was a “very secret” report prepared in January 1973 for Angelo Vicari, chief of the Italian National Police, and included in the Georgetown collection. It conveyed the views of an Italian intelligence officer serving in Washington to his superiors in Rome, including his impressions of the CIA.</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=164320\"></div>\n\n<p>“He regards the offensive sector of the CIA as better than the defensive sector and says that noteworthy conflicts exist between the two of them,” the report said. “The man who ruined the defensive sector there is Angleton, known to you personally — who though fortunately set aside for some time — is still in a position to do harm.”</p>\n<p>“According to this opinion, not his (because he does not know him personally) but of his service, Angleton is clinically mad and his madness has only gotten worse in these later years. This is a madness that is all the more dangerous because it is sustained by an intelligence that has about it elements of the monstrous and that rests on a hallucinatory logical construction. The whole is unified by a pride that imposes a refusal to recognize his own errors.”</p>\n<p>That was hearsay evidence of a widely held belief that buttressed what even Angleton’s onetime supporters admitted: The man’s thinking bordered on delusional, even as he was too proud to admit he might be wrong about anything.</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/WEB-BW-AP_750925011-1514393523.jpg\"><img alt=\"James Angleton, former Chief of Counterintelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency, answers questions before the Senate Intelligence Committee in Washington D.C. on Sept. 25, 1975.

Angleton’s expansive view of the CIA’s scope of operations was discredited in the mid-1970s, but it returned in the 1980s with President Ronald Reagan, who countenanced the extra-legal activities that culminated in the Iran-Contra scandal. After the September 11 attacks, the George W. Bush administration revived Angleton’s warrantless mass surveillance program for the digital age. To oversimplify only slightly, Dick Cheney picked up where Jim Angleton left off.\n<p>Angleton acted zealously on a theory of history whose validity is hard to accept and harder to dispute: that secret intelligence agencies can control the destiny of mankind. He had a keen understanding of how intelligence agencies covertly manipulate societies, and he believed that such operations could turn the tide of history. He would not have been surprised by Russia’s meddling in the U.S. presidential election of 2016. The CIA had used such tactics in scores of votes around the world, starting with the 1948 Italian elections, which prevented the communist party from coming to power, and in which Angleton himself played a key role.</p>\n<p>Angleton lived and thrived in what he called “the wilderness of mirrors,” his favorite phrase for Soviet deception operations. When David Martin published a book about Angleton called “Wilderness of Mirrors,” Angleton indignantly claimed he had coined the phrase, according to a three-page memo included in the Georgetown collection. He hadn’t. He had first read it in T.S. Eliot’s poem, “<a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/gerontion\">Gerontion</a>.” But his explication of the metaphor was apt. The phrase, he wrote in the memo, perfectly captured the “myriad of stratagems, deceptions, artifices, and all the other devices of disinformation which the Soviet bloc and its coordinated intelligence services use to confuse and split the West … an ever fluid landscape where fact and illusion merge.”</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=164319\"></div>\n\n<p>The most powerful intelligence agencies traffic in facts and illusions to manipulate societies on a massive scale. Substitute “CIA” for “Soviet bloc” and “America’s perceived enemies” for “the West” and you have a solid description of U.S. covert action around the globe for the last 70 years. Substitute “Putin’s Russia” for “Soviet bloc” and you’ve captured the FSB-sponsored social media operations in recent U.S., French, and German elections.</p>\n<p>The Cram papers suggest that if Angleton were in government today, he would approve of the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance capabilities, which were reportedly used to listen in on Russians calling their contacts in Trump Tower. He probably would have overestimated the FSB’s capacity to pull off deception operations, such as social media-driven “fake news,” and their impact on American government, just as he overestimated the KGB’s capabilities and influence in the 1960s. He would have searched long and hard for “moles,” the agent or agents inside the U.S. intelligence community who helped the Russians advance their schemes. Counterintelligence was Angleton’s religion, and he would have insisted on its relevance.</p>\n<p>Cram continued to study Angleton and share the lessons of his extraordinary career for the rest of his life, even as his epic study remained a state secret. In his 1993 monograph, declassified a decade later, Cram concluded that Angleton was “self-centered, ambitious and paranoid with little regard for his agency colleagues or simple common sense.” He was a visionary and a crank, a prophet and a law breaker, a national security menace just slightly ahead of his time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Jefferson Morley is the author of “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Secret-Spymaster-James-Angleton/dp/1250080614/\">The Ghost: The Secret Life of CIA Spymaster James Jesus Angleton</a>.”</em></p>\n<p>Top photo: Former CIA counterintelligence chief James J.

        "content": "<p><u>Donald Trump made</u> his formal entry into politics with the racism and xenophobia that would become a hallmark of his lightning-rod candidacy and, ultimately, his first year in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said in his presidential announcement speech. “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”</p>\n<p>“It’s coming from more than Mexico,” Trump continued. “It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>Fast forward 2 1/2 years. Trump is wrapping up his first calendar year as president, and he’s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/\">failed to make policy progress</a> on many of his campaign promises. But when it comes to immigration, the president has proven to be much more than just a big talker. In his first year, he’s significantly uprooted immigration policy, tearing apart the families of longtime residents and erecting significant barriers in the face of would-be immigrants to the United States.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s clear that this administration wants to bring any sort of immigration to the U.S. to a halt, whether it’s legal or what’s touted as illegal immigration,” said Annaluisa Padilla, a California-based immigration attorney and president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The administration simply does not want any immigrants.”</p>\n<p>The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, released a <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-under-trump-review-policy-shifts\">policy brief</a> this month on shifts in immigration policy since Trump’s election that reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>“For a long time, there’s been bipartisan consensus that immigration overall is good for the country, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for society, and it’s integral to our history as a country,” report co-author Sarah Pierce told The Intercept. “But this president has completely broken from that history and is seriously advocating for a reduction in legal immigration.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, the White House recently called for an end to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/time-end-chain-migration/\">chain migration</a>,” which it defines as “the process by which foreign nationals resettle within the U.S. and subsequently bring over their foreign relatives, who then have the opportunity to bring over their foreign relatives, and so on.” The term is popular among anti-immigrant hard-liners, including former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/dr-duke-on-terrorism-spawned-by-jewish-led-immigration-policy-the-zioauthored-1965-ethnic-cleansing-act/\">David Duke</a>. The president has also <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-backs-raise-act/\">endorsed</a> the RAISE Act, a Senate Republican bill that proposes major cuts to family immigration and the creation of a points system to select immigrants for employment sponsorship.</p>\n<p>By pivoting his focus to legal forms of immigration, Trump is demonstrating that his immigration agenda is driven by xenophobia, not just an insistence on punishing those with an unauthorized presence in the United States.<br>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Trump-Travel-Ban-1514581027.jpg\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 06:  Three year old Mirhan Khafi (R) holds on to her mother Najma Abdishakur (C) as she hugs her mother Zahra Warsma (L) after arriving from Somalia at Dulles International airport on February 6, 2017 in Washington, DC.

His executive order on interior enforcement, among other things, essentially made every person in the United States without proper legal documents a priority for deportation, a significant departure from a 2014 Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_prosecutorial_discretion.pdf\">policy</a> that prioritized immigrants who posed a national security threat, serious criminals, and recent border crossers.\n<p>From January 20 to September 30, Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2017\">removed</a> 61,094 immigrants from the interior of the country, a 37 percent increase over the same time period in 2016. During that period, ICE <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2017\">arrested</a> 110,568 people, a 42 percent increase over the previous year. With the heightened interior enforcement came the widespread targeting of long-term residents with strong community and family ties to the United States, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/07/florida-deportation-trump-supporter-gonzalez-carillo-chavez-palm-beach/\">people whom the Obama administration had allowed to stay in the country</a> as long as they periodically checked in with ICE.</p>\n<p>While nearly 74 percent of people arrested by ICE during the 2017 fiscal year had criminal histories, nearly 11 percent had no known criminal history, and about 16 percent had pending criminal charges — meaning they had not been convicted of a crime.</p>\n<p>Even those with criminal convictions “are not the dangerous, violent criminals highlighted in the president’s rhetoric and in ICE press releases,” a Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/05/deported/immigrants-uprooted-country-they-call-home\">analysis</a> concluded. “One in three ‘criminal’ arrests involved someone whose most serious crime was an immigration offense, almost always the act of entering the country illegally. About 16 percent had been convicted of a drug offense and another 15 percent had a traffic offense as their most serious crime. Fewer than 1 percent had been convicted of a homicide, and the most serious offense of only 19 percent, fewer than one in five, included violent or potentially violent crimes.”</p>\n<p>The total number of deportations in the 2017 fiscal year — <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2017/iceByTheNumbersFY17Infographic.pdf\">226,119</a> — is <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016/table39\">lower</a> than the number of removals during the Bush and Obama years. This difference can be partially attributed to a significant drop in border crossings. “The decrease in ICE’s overall removal numbers from FY2016 to FY2017 was primarily due to the decline in border apprehensions in 2017,” according to ICE, “possibly reflecting an increased deterrent effect from ICE’s stronger interior enforcement efforts.”</p>\n<p>Padilla, the immigration attorney from California, said many of her clients are now living with anxiety. “They’re desperate and feel that they can’t even leave their houses without the fear that they can’t return back to their families,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has also reduced refugee resettlement to a historic low. The outgoing Obama administration set a refugee admissions ceiling of 110,000 for the 2017 fiscal year; within a week of entering office, Trump slashed that figure to 50,000 and temporarily suspended refugee admissions for 120 days. Ultimately, the United States admitted 53,716 refugees in 2017. In September, the administration set a ceiling of 45,000 refugee admissions for the 2018 fiscal year, the lowest it’s been since the 1980 enactment of the Refugee Act, despite a global refugee crisis. The reason, the State Department <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/09/274464.htm\">explained at the time</a>, was to focus more efforts on the Department of Homeland Security’s “need to tackle the domestic asylum backlog.”</p>\n<p>Two months into the current fiscal year, the United States had admitted 3,108 refugees — about 7 percent of the target. (In the same period last year, 18,300 refugees — about 17 percent of the 110,000-person ceiling — had been resettled.) The administration also ended a refugee and parole program for Central American youth.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has implemented more stringent vetting procedures for refugees from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/24/refugee-nations-trump-administration-muslim-244135\">11 countries</a> — a list believed to include Iraq, Somalia, and Syria, countries with some of the highest numbers of refugees — but has also added layers of security screening for refugees from all over.</p>\n<p>And that’s not the only way Trump has followed through on his promise of “extreme vetting.”</p>\n<p>Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, noted that while the president is limited by the fact that most changes to legal immigration need to go through Congress, “the administration has done things that maybe reduced legal immigration, but at the very least have at least increased the obstacles for people who want to come to the United States legally.”</p>\n<p>Those measures include mandatory in-person interviews for applicants for employment-based permanent residency; an increase in the amount of information would-be immigrants must provide, including, in some cases, 15 years of travel and employment history; and requests for social media account information.</p>\n<p>The enhanced vetting procedures and Trump’s virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric may already have had a chilling effect around the world. According to the Migration Policy Institute report, tourism to the United States in the first six months of 2017 dropped nearly 4 percent compared to the same period last year, universities have reported drops in international student enrollment, and the demand for employment-based visas dropped for the first time since the Great Recession. Still, Pierce cautioned, “in the data world of immigration, it’s very hard to draw a direct line between a cause and effect.”</p>\n<p>Trump is also tearing away the temporary forms of relief available to groups of unauthorized immigrants who were previously able to work and live in the United States without fear of deportation. In September, the president announced the end of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that shielded from deportation nearly 800,000 people brought illegally to the United States as minors. While he also urged Congress to pass a replacement program before DACA’s end in March, no real progress was made on that front this year.</p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security has also canceled Temporary Protected Status — a form of humanitarian protection for citizens of countries embroiled in violent conflict or suffering from a natural disaster — for citizens of Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan, saying, despite evidence to the contrary, that those countries are now safe to return to. The agency has signaled it may end TPS for Honduras, which received an extension until July 2018, and for El Salvador, from which about 60 percent of 400,000 TPS recipients hail.</p>\n<p>In addition to dealing with clients’ overall anxiety, immigration lawyers are experiencing new challenges in the courtroom. Since January, Padilla said, immigration judges have been reluctant to grant extensions to give lawyers and their clients time to properly prepare for their court hearings. These procedures are particularly onerous in asylum cases, Padilla noted, because it often takes months for applicants to obtain documents from their home countries and to find experts and witnesses who can testify in court.</p>\n<p>“We have had a court backlog for quite a few years, but what I saw in the last year is, ‘Let’s just get this case done. It doesn’t matter if it’s well-prepared or not. Get it before me, counsel,’” Padilla said. “And that’s the challenge. It does not allow for proper due process for clients.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Demonstrators march on Capitol Hill in Washington during an immigration rally in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs, Dec. 6, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/31/one-year-of-immigration-under-trump/\">One Year of Immigration Under Trump</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Ever since, Facebook has been on a censorship rampage against Palestinian activists who protest the decades-long, illegal Israeli occupation, all directed and determined by Israeli officials. Indeed, Israeli officials have been <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/facebook-neutral-palestine-israel-conflict-160921115752070.html\">publicly boasting</a> about how obedient Facebook is when it comes to Israeli censorship orders:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Shortly after news broke earlier this month of the agreement between the Israeli government and Facebook, Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said Tel Aviv had submitted 158 requests to the social media giant over the previous four months asking it to remove content it deemed “incitement.” She said Facebook had granted 95 percent of the requests.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She’s right. The submission to Israeli dictates is hard to overstate: As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/facebook-struggles-to-put-out-online-fires-in-israeli-palestinian-conflict.html\">put it</a> in December of last year, “Israeli security agencies monitor Facebook and send the company posts they consider incitement. Facebook has responded by removing most of them.”</p>\n<p>What makes this censorship particularly consequential is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-facebook-activist-journalist-arrests-censorship-accusations-incitement-a7377776.html\">that</a> “96 percent of Palestinians said their primary use of Facebook was for following news.” That means that Israeli officials have virtually unfettered control over a key communications forum of Palestinians.</p>\n<p>In the weeks following those Facebook-Israel meetings, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-facebook-activist-journalist-arrests-censorship-accusations-incitement-a7377776.html\">reported The Independent</a>, “the activist collective Palestinian Information Center reported that at least 10 of their administrators’ accounts for their Arabic and English Facebook pages — followed by more than 2 million people — have been suspended, seven of them permanently, which they say is a result of new measures put in place in the wake of Facebook’s meeting with Israel.” Last March, Facebook briefly shut down the Facebook page of the political party, Fatah, followed by millions, “because of an old photo posted of former leader <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/yasser-arafat.html\">Yasser Arafat</a> holding a rifle.”</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.madacenter.org/images/text_editor/FBviolationsE.pdf\">2016 report</a> from the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedoms detailed how extensive the Facebook censorship was:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pages and personal accounts that were filtered and blocked: Palestinian Dialogue Network (PALDF.net) Gaza now, Jerusalem News Network, Shihab agency, Radio Bethlehem 2000, Orient Radio Network, page Mesh Heck, Ramallah news, journalist Huzaifa Jamous from Abu Dis, activist Qassam Bedier, activist Mohammed Ghannam, journalist Kamel Jbeil, administrative accounts for Al Quds Page, administrative accounts Shihab agency, activist Abdel-Qader al-Titi, youth activist Hussein Shajaeih, Ramah Mubarak (account is activated), Ahmed Abdel Aal (account is activated), Mohammad Za’anin (still deleted), Amer Abu Arafa (still deleted), Abdulrahman al-Kahlout (still deleted).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Needless to say, Israelis have virtually free rein to post whatever they want about Palestinians. Calls by Israelis for the <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/patrick-strickland/bombing-gaza-children-gives-me-orgasm-israelis-celebrate-slaughter-facebook\">killing of Palestinians are commonplace</a> on Facebook, and largely remain undisturbed.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/vengeance-1514640203.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/vengeance-1514640203-1000x781.png\" class=\"wp-image-164448\"></a> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As Al Jazeera <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/facebook-neutral-palestine-israel-conflict-160921115752070.html\">reported last year</a>, “Inflammatory speech posted in the Hebrew language … has attracted much less attention from the Israeli authorities and Facebook.” One study found that “122,000 users directly called for violence with words like ‘murder,’ ‘kill,’ or ‘burn.’ Arabs were the No. 1 recipients of hateful comments.” Yet there appears to be little effort by Facebook to censor any of that.</p>\n<p>Though some of the most inflammatory and explicit calls for murder are sometimes removed, Facebook continues to allow the most extremist calls for incitement against Palestinians to flourish. Indeed, Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/7/gaza-israel-palestiniantwitterfacebook.html\">has often used social media</a> to post what is clearly incitement to violence against Palestinians generally. In contrast to Facebook’s active suppression against Palestinians, the very idea that Facebook would ever use its censorship power against Netanyahu or other prominent Israelis calling for violence and inciting attacks is unthinkable. Indeed, as Al Jazeera <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/facebook-neutral-palestine-israel-conflict-160921115752070.html\">concisely put it</a>, “Facebook hasn’t met Palestinian leaders to discuss their concern.”</p>\n<p><u>Facebook now seems</u> to be explicitly admitting that it also intends to follow the censorship orders of the U.S. government. Earlier this week, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/world/europe/chechnya-kadyrov-facebook.html\">company deleted</a> the Facebook and Instagram accounts of Ramzan Kadyrov, the repressive, brutal, and authoritarian leader of the Chechen Republic, who had a combined 4 million followers on those accounts. To put it mildly, Kadyrov — who is given free rein to rule the province in exchange for ultimate loyalty to Moscow — is the opposite of a sympathetic figure: He has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/victim-chechnya-anti-gay-purge-urges-russia-investigate-maxim-lapunov\">credibly accused</a> of a wide range of horrific human rights violations, from the imprisonment and torture of LGBTs to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/europe/26chechen.html\">kidnapping and killing</a> of dissidents.</p>\n<p>But none of that dilutes how disturbing and dangerous Facebook’s rationale for its deletion of his accounts is. A Facebook spokesperson told the New York Times that the company deleted these accounts not because Kadyrov is a mass murderer and tyrant, but that “Mr. Kadyrov’s accounts were deactivated because he had just been added to a United States sanctions list and that the company was legally obligated to act.”</p>\n<p>As the Times notes, this rationale appears dubious or at least inconsistently applied: Others who are on the same sanctions list, such as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, remain active on both Facebook and Instagram. But just consider the incredibly menacing implications of Facebook’s claims.</p>\n<p>What this means is obvious: that the U.S. government — meaning, at the moment, the Trump administration — has the unilateral and unchecked power to force the removal of anyone it wants from Facebook and Instagram by simply including them on a sanctions list. Does anyone think this is a good outcome? Does anyone trust the Trump administration — or any other government — to compel social media platforms to delete and block anyone it wants to be silenced? As the ACLU’s Jennifer Granick told the Times:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s not a law that appears to be written or designed to deal with the special situations where it’s lawful or appropriate to repress speech. … This sanctions law is being used to suppress speech with little consideration of the free expression values and the special risks of blocking speech, as opposed to blocking commerce or funds as the sanctions was designed to do. That’s really problematic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Does Facebook’s policy of blocking people from its platform who are sanctioned apply to all governments? Obviously not. It goes without saying that if, say, Iran decided to impose sanctions on <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/363465-schumer-advised-trump-on-declaring-jerusalem-as-israels-capital\">Chuck Schumer for his support of Trump’s policy</a> of recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, Facebook would never delete the accounts of the Democratic Party Senate minority leader — just as Facebook would never delete the accounts of Israeli officials who incite violence against Palestinians or who are sanctioned by Palestinian officials. Just last month, Russia <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/canada-russia-magnitsky-sanctions-united-states-browder/28834596.html\">announced retaliatory sanctions</a> against various Canadian officials and executives, but needless to say, Facebook took no action to censor them or block their accounts.</p>\n<p>Similarly, would Facebook ever dare censor American politicians or journalists who use social media to call for violence against America’s enemies? To ask the question is to answer it.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/violence-1514640798.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/violence-1514640798-540x530.png\" class=\"wp-image-164450\"></a> </div>\n<p>As is<em> always</em> true of censorship, there is one, and only one, principle driving all of this: power. Facebook will submit to and obey the censorship demands of governments and officials who actually wield power over it, while ignoring those who do not. That’s why declared enemies of the U.S. and Israeli governments are vulnerable to censorship measures by Facebook, whereas U.S and Israeli officials (and their most tyrannical and repressive allies) are not:</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/faz3-1514639920.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/faz3-1514639920-1000x587.png\" class=\"wp-image-164447\"></a> </div>\n<p>All of this illustrates that the same severe dangers from state censorship are <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/08/21/twitter-facebook-executives-arbiters-see-read/\">raised at least as much by the pleas for Silicon Valley giants</a> to more actively censor “bad speech.” Calls for state censorship may often be well-intentioned — a desire to protect marginalized groups from damaging “hate speech” — yet, predictably, they are far more often used <em>against </em>marginalized groups: to censor them rather than protect them. One need merely look at how <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/29/in-europe-hate-speech-laws-are-often-used-to-suppress-and-punish-left-wing-viewpoints/\">hate speech laws are used in Europe</a>, or <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/the-palestine-exception\">on U.S. college campuses</a>, to see that the censorship victims are often <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-19604735\">critics of European wars</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/french-high-court-bds-activists-guilty-of-discrimination/\">activists against Israeli occupation</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/bahar-mustafa-police-called-in-over-goldsmiths-union-diversity-officers-race-hate-tweet-10268964.html\">advocates for minority rights</a>.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/bdscensorshi-1514641366.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/bdscensorshi-1514641366-540x276.png\" class=\"wp-image-164451\"></a> </div>\n<p>One can create a fantasy world in one’s head, if one wishes, in which Silicon Valley executives use their power to protect marginalized peoples around the world by censoring those who wish to harm them. But in the real world, that is nothing but a sad pipe dream. Just as governments will, these companies will use their censorship power to serve, not to undermine, the world’s most powerful factions.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/blm-1514642403.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/blm-1514642403-540x226.png\" class=\"wp-image-164452\"></a> </div>\n<p>Just as one might cheer the censorship of someone one dislikes without contemplating the long-term consequences of the principle being validated, one can cheer the disappearance from Facebook and Instagram of a Chechen monster. But Facebook is explicitly telling you that the reason for its actions is that it was obeying the decrees of the U.S. government about who must be shunned.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to believe that anyone’s ideal view of the internet entails vesting power in the U.S. government, the Israeli government, and other world powers to decide who may be heard on it and who must be suppressed. But increasingly, in the name of pleading with internet companies to protect us, that’s exactly what is happening.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/30/facebook-says-it-is-deleting-accounts-at-the-direction-of-the-u-s-and-israeli-governments/\">Facebook Says It Is Deleting Accounts at the Direction of the U.S. and Israeli Governments</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Radsch destacou que o número de jornalistas na cadeia por acusações de notícias falsas (“fake news”) mais do que dobrou. “Parece haver uma manifestação na vida real do discurso de ‘fake news’ que procura macular e deslegitimar o papel dos jornalistas e do jornalismo na sociedade, especialmente nas democracias”, disse ela.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">“Parece haver uma manifestação na vida real do discurso de ‘fake news’ que procura denegrir e deslegitimar o papel dos jornalistas e do jornalismo na sociedade, especialmente nas democracias”, disse ela.</blockquote>\n<p>De forma semelhante a anos anteriores, 90% dos jornalistas assassinados eram locais, e muitos morreram em zonas de guerra. Embora no total haja menos mortes de jornalistas no Oriente Médio do que há alguns anos, o Iraque e a Síria foram os lugares mais letais para jornalistas em 2017. Foram mortos mais jornalistas no Iraque do que em qualquer outro país desde 1992, quando o CPJ começou a coletar registros detalhados. Na guerra do Iêmen, pelo menos dois jornalistas foram mortos em consequência de projéteis lançados pelas milícias dos houthis e de Saleh, e pelo menos mais dois jornalistas foram feridos em ataques aéreos da coalizão liderada pela Arábia Saudita.</p>\n<p>O terceiro pior país foi o México, onde pelo menos seis pessoas morreram em decorrência de sua atividade jornalística.

Segundo Radsch, as mortes dos repórteres mexicanos estavam ligadas, em regra, às coberturas que haviam feito sobre corrupção, cartéis de drogas e crime organizado, mas praticamente nenhum dos assassinos foi levado à justiça. “É a combinação dos assassinatos desenfreados com a impunidade endêmica que causa um efeito assustador no México”, ela acrescentou.

A média histórica de mulheres jornalistas mortas é de 7% do total, mas esse ano ela chegou a 19%. Uma das razões possíveis é que haja mais mulheres cobrindo editorias e regiões perigosas em relação aos anos anteriores, como entende Lauren Wolfe, jornalista investigativa e diretora do programa “Mulheres do Women’s Media Center [Centro de Mídia Feminina] Sob Cerco”.</p>\n<p>Mulheres jornalistas enfrentam riscos específicos: elas estão, por exemplo, mais sujeitas a sofrer agressão sexual e assédio online do que seus colegas do sexo masculino. Wolfe disse que, com frequência, aqueles que deveriam proteger as jornalistas, como guardas e motoristas, podem representar a maior ameaça ao trabalho.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“Os tipos de ameaças que as mulheres enfrentam são igualmente insidiosas e ameaçadoras para a liberdade de imprensa.”</blockquote>\n<p>Embora o abuso sexual venha se mostrando, para as mulheres jornalistas, um dos maiores empecilhos à liberdade de imprensa, o CPJ não acompanha estatísticas sobre o assunto em seus relatórios anuais.</p>\n<p>Para Elisa Lees Muñoz, diretora-executiva da International Women’s Media Foundation (Fundação Internacional das Mulheres na Mídia), essa é uma limitação. “Não é possível ter uma visão do todo quando são monitorados apenas homicídios, encarceramentos e processos judiciais, porque os tipos de ameaça que as mulheres enfrentam são igualmente insidiosas e ameaçadoras para a liberdade de imprensa”, disse Muñoz a The Intercept.</p>\n<p>Radsch, do CPJ, explicou que o desafio de monitorar incidentes de abuso sexual é que, ao contrário dos encarceramentos e homicídos, eles não costumam ser presenciados externamente: quem sofreu o abuso é que precisa levá-lo a público.</p>\n<p>Mesmo que o movimento #MeToo tenha trazido uma enxurrada de denúncias, as mulheres ainda são reticentes ao falar de suas experiências de agressão, por medo das potenciais repercussões. Uma delas é que a questão ainda representa um estigma cultural e profissional. Muñoz destacou como a violência com base em gênero pode levar as redações a adotarem uma abordagem paternalista, limitando as oportunidades de trabalho disponíveis para as mulheres e impedindo-as de progredir em suas carreiras num ritmo semelhante ao dos homens.</p>\n<p>“Já vimos homens que foram encarcerados voltarem ao trabalho, já vimos homens que foram sequestrados aceitarem trabalhos em ambientes hostis. Isso não parece comprometer sua habilidade de voltar a cobrir esses locais, enquanto as mulheres são automaticamente tratadas como se tivesse sofrido algum tipo de dano e precisassem ser protegidas”, disse ela.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/cjr-report-journalists-killed-2017-2-1513802317.jpg\"><img alt=\"TOPSHOT - The sons of murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia carry the coffin of their mother out of the church in Mosta, on November 3, 2017, after her funeral ceremony.

Além da distinção homem-mulher, o CPJ acrescentou uma categoria não binária ao seu banco de dados, mas até agora não há registros disponíveis sobre as experiências de jornalistas não cisgênero.</p>\n<p>Tanto Wolfe quanto Muñoz sugeriram que contratar mais mulheres em altos cargos gerenciais seria uma forma de ajudar as redações a criar um ambiente mais seguro para mulheres jornalistas. Além disso, Muñoz entende que é preciso haver nas redações uma cultura focada na diversidade como um objetivo em si mesmo. “Isso precisa ser uma prioridade”, declarou. As redações deveriam “querer ter mulheres na atividade jornalística, para que elas possam dar uma diversidade de perspectivas”.</p>\n<p>Foto do Título: Policiais e especialistas forenses inspecionam os restos de um carro-bomba que se acredita ter matado a jornalista e blogueira Daphne Caruana Galizia perto de sua casa Bidnija, Malta, em 16 de outubro de 2017.</p>\n<p><em>Tradução: Deborah Leão</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/30/mulheres-jornalistas-mortas-2017/\">2017 foi um ano especialmente letal para mulheres jornalistas, aponta relatório</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>On December 29,</u> more than a decade after she was first sent to prison in Nevada for a murder she did not commit, Kirstin Blaise Lobato saw the charges against her dismissed. “It is the end to her nearly 17-year nightmare,” said Vanessa Potkin, director of post-conviction litigation for the Innocence Project, which took on Lobato’s case. “It’s over.”</p>\n<p>Lobato was twice convicted of the gruesome murder of a 44-year-old homeless man named Duran Bailey, whose body was found behind a dumpster off the Las Vegas Strip just after 10 p.m. on July 8, 2001, covered in a thin layer of trash. Bailey’s teeth had been knocked out and his eyes were bloodied and swollen shut; his carotid artery had been slashed, his rectum stabbed, and his penis amputated. It was found among the trash nearby.</p>\n<p>Despite a crime scene rich with potential evidence, Las Vegas detectives Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/03/12/murderinvegas/\">ignored obvious leads</a> and instead focused their investigation on 18-year-old Lobato, based solely on a third-hand rumor.</p>\n<p>Lobato, who was a stranger to Bailey, had an alibi for the day of the crime: She was at home with her parents in the small town of Panaca, nearly three hours northeast of Las Vegas near the Utah state line. Still, detectives and prosecutors insisted that Lobato had been in the city during the early morning hours of July 8, killing Bailey before setting off in her old Pontiac Fiero for the long drive up the unlit, mountainous highway, making it home in time to get cleaned up before being seen around the neighborhood later that morning.</p>\n<p>The state’s theory of the crime fell apart this past October, when Potkin and a team from the Innocence Project presented nearly a week’s worth of testimony from several renowned entomologists and a medical examiner, each of whom demonstrated why the state’s narrative never made any scientific sense. In short, had Bailey been slaughtered in the pre-dawn hours and his body left outside all day in the summer heat, as the state claimed, blowflies — nature’s swift and ubiquitous first responders to scenes of death — would have quickly colonized his remains, leaving visible clusters of eggs in his various wounds.</p>\n<p>Still, the prosecution would not be bowed: At the October hearing, prosecutor <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/25/kirstin-lobato-murder-trial-las-vegas/\">Sandra DiGiacomo tried</a> to peddle the notion that flies in Las Vegas behave unlike flies everywhere else in the world. It didn’t work. In a detailed opinion filed December 19, Judge Stefany Miley <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/kirstin-blaise-lobato-las-vegas-homeless-penis-murder/\">concluded</a> that the testimony of Lobato’s experts was credible, and had a jury heard such evidence, she might have been acquitted. Miley granted Lobato a new trial.</p>\n<p>That left District Attorney Steven Wolfson with three possibilities: appeal the ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court (a longshot given <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/12/01/a-rumor-put-kirstin-lobato-in-prison-for-murder-now-shell-get-a-new-hearing/\">the court had granted</a> the hearing before Judge Miley based on its determination that Lobato’s alibi evidence was strong); retry the case (another loser option, particularly since Miley’s ruling left the DA without any evidence to try the case again), or dismiss the charges and free Lobato.</p>\n<p>On Friday morning, Wolfson chose option three, and prosecutors went to court to ask that a judge dismiss the charges against Lobato “with prejudice” — meaning the state could never seek to prosecute her again for the crime.</p>\n<p>By Friday afternoon, Potkin said she had spent the day on and off the phone with the Florence McClure Women’s Correctional Center in Las Vegas trying to arrange for Lobato’s immediate release — as was called for in the judge’s order. “The defendant shall be released from the custody of the Nevada Department of Corrections forthwith,” Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez wrote. If Lobato isn’t released on December 29, Potkin said, she will have to remain in prison through New Year’s Day.</p>\n<p>For Michelle Ravell, Lobato’s dedicated advocate, her release can’t come a minute too soon. Ravell said that Lobato, now 35, will live with her while she works to put her life back together. Indeed, Lobato has spent most of her adulthood locked up for a crime she did not commit. “I always knew this was going to happen,” Ravell said. “I just want to go and get her.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Kirstin Blaise Lobato, convicted of the July 2001 murder of Duran Bailey, at the Clark County Courthouse for a new hearing on the case on Oct. 12, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/29/las-vegas-murder-kirstin-lobato-wrongful-conviction/\">17 Years After Being Convicted of a Grisly Murder in Vegas, Kirstin Lobato Sees Her Charges Dismissed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Sulzberger, the 37-year-old son of its current publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. will become the paper’s new publisher on January 1, 2018.</p>\n<p>News coverage of the changeover noted that Sulzberger became a reporter for the Times in 2009, led an <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-one-of-the-key-documents-of-this-media-age/\">internal 2014 study</a> on how the Times needed to change in a digital world, and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conversation-with-a-g-sulzberger-the-new-leader-of-the-new-york-times\">is a vegetarian</a>.</p>\n<p>What no one mentioned is that Sulzberger’s journalism is appreciated by a surprising figure: Wisconsin’s Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who used an article co-written by Sulzberger to bolster the resolve of wavering GOP lawmakers in the midst of Walker’s ferocious attack on public sector unions in 2011.</p>\n<p>Walker became a hero of conservatives nationwide when he successfully pushed Act 10 through the Wisconsin legislature in the face of enormous, weekslong protests of up to 100,000 people in Madison, the state capital. The bill imposed severe restrictions on the collective bargaining rights of public sector unions that generally support Democratic politicians. (It exempted police and firefighter unions, which generally lean right, from the changes.) Walker then won a recall election in 2012 and was re-elected in 2014.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/scott-walker-1514573764.jpg\"><img alt=\"MADISON, WI - MARCH 11:  Republican Wisconsin State Legislatures look on as Wisconsin Gov.

In reality, it was Ian Murphy, a reporter for an alternative Buffalo newspaper, pretending to be Koch. Murphy taped the call and then <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/transcript-of-prank-koch-walker-conversation/article_531276b6-3f6a-11e0-b288-001cc4c002e0.html\">put it online</a>.\n<p>During the conversation, “Koch” told Walker that it was “beautiful” to see his plans to “crush that union” and urged Walker to “bring a baseball bat” to any discussions with Democrats.</p>\n<p>Walker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBnSv3a6Nh4&t=8m54s\">then explained</a> how gratifying and useful he’d found a recent Times article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I tell the speaker, the Senate majority leader every night, give me a list of the people I need to call at home, to shore ’em up. The New York Times, of all things, I don’t normally tell people to read the New York Times, but the front page of the New York Times has got a great story, one of these unbelievable moments of true journalism, what is supposed to be objective journalism. They got out of the capital and went down one county south of the capital to Janesville, to Rock County, that’s where the General Motors plant once was …</p>\n<p>They moved out two years ago. The lead on this story is about a guy who was laid off two years ago, uh, he’s been laid off twice by GM, who points out that, uh, everybody else in his town has had to sacrifice except for all these public employees and it’s about damn time they do, and he supports me. Um, and they had a bartender, they had, I mean, every stereotypical blue-collar worker-type they interviewed, and the only ones that weren’t with us were people who were either a public employee or married to a public employee. It’s an unbelievable story. So I went through and called all these uh, a handful, a dozen or so lawmakers I worry about each day and said, “Everyone, we should get that story printed out and send it to anyone giving you grief.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>This piece, headlined “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/us/22union.html?_r=1\">Union Bonds in Wisconsin Begin to Fray</a>,” was written by Sulzberger and his fellow Times reporter Monica Davey.</p>\n<p>Walker’s description was generally accurate. The Times article portrays a conflict between the intellectual elites in Madison who “predictably oppose” Walker’s plans and the <i>real</i> Wisconsinites “away from Madison” who believe that “public workers needed to share in the sacrifice that their own families have been forced to make.” It quotes six people who worked in the private sector who supported Walker’s crackdown on public sector unions, and only two who didn’t like it.</p>\n<p>However, this three-to-one ratio in support of Walker seems slightly peculiar, given the voting patterns in the area. The eight Wisconsinites lived in towns across Rock, Walworth, and Jefferson counties. Walker won 55 percent of the vote in the three counties in <a href=\"https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/datagraph.php?year=2010&fips=55&f=0&off=5&elect=0\">2010</a>, and 54 percent in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/wisconsin-recall-results\">2012 recall election</a>. Both times, Walker actually lost Rock County, where Janesville is located, making up for it in the other two, redder counties.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a <a href=\"https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/polls/walker-would-lose-rematch-with-barrett-in-wisconsin/\">poll at the time</a> found that 57 percent of Wisconsinites overall supported the right of public unions to collectively bargain, while just 37 percent opposed it.</p>\n<p>Also notable is Walker’s excitement that the lead on the story is about a man named Rich Hahn, who’d been laid off twice by GM. The reason for Walker’s joy is obvious: The piece <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2011/02/22/State-Workers-in-Wisconsin-See-a-Fraying-of-Union-Bonds/stories/201102220139\">originally described Hahn</a> as “a union man from a union town” who nevertheless believed “something needs to be done … and quickly” about greedy public unions. However, after the United Auto Workers found no record of Hahn as a member, the Times ran a correction reading that while Hahn “described himself to a reporter as a ‘union guy,’ he now says that he has worked at unionized factories, but was not himself a union member.”</p>\n<p>After the release of the prank call to Walker, Sulzberger immediately wrote <a href=\"https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/walker-receives-prank-call-from-koch-impersonator/\">an article</a> about it, but modestly made no mention of Walker’s praise for his work.</p>\n<p>There’s little else in the public record about Sulzberger’s attitude toward unions generally or unions representing New York Times workers in particular. However, Sulzberger’s father has sporadically had <a href=\"http://mediaworkers.org/new-york-times-workers-stage-walk-out-to-protest-collective-bargaining/\">tense relations</a> with the paper’s unions.</p>\n<p>In any case, nervous Republican lawmakers held tight and passed Act 10.

        "content": "<p><u>In a culture</u> of sound bites and memes, one conservative trope that has strangely stuck to liberals and Democrats is that of “coastal elites.” It’s a phrase frequently used by talking heads and Twitter bots alike to describe wealthy, aloof snobs who live on America’s East and West coasts — far away, in spirit and distance, from the real, land-locked people of middle America. The Notion came up recently in the debate over the Republican tax bill: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, seemed positively giddy to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abc7newsbayarea/status/943365850920357888\">announce</a> taxes would only go up for “rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco.”</p>\n<p>Except the idea that the right hates coastal elites is a farce. President Donald Trump and his ruling clique — his family, advisers (and family-advisers), staff (and family-staff), and cabinet — are themselves the exaggerated, cartoonish personification of the coastal elite. The Republican government, in other words, is being led by the very same folks the right wing has been warning its followers about for years.</p>\n<p>Say a novelist concocted a story about a wealthy, white billionaire who lives in a gold-plated penthouse with his third wife, 24 years his junior, overlooking Manhattan, who surrounds himself with filthy rich mansion dwellers from up and down the East and West coasts, and then convinces middle America to vote him into the presidency on a rising tide of hating coastal elites, from which he comes. Such a tale would seem so far-fetched and preposterous that it would be considered some type of dystopian fiction.</p>\n<p>Trump, son of rich parents, father to rich children, once owned a yacht <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-08/news/vw-6809_1_donald-trump\">with 210 telephones</a>. His private jet, said to be like “floating on a cloud of opulence,” <a href=\"http://buffalonews.com/2014/01/30/flying-on-a-cloud-of-opulence-the-donald-comes-to-town-today/\">has gold-plated seatbelt buckles, faucet knobs, and table legs</a>. He has spent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-trump-spent-nearly-one-third-of-first-year-in-office-at-trump-owned-properties-1514206800\">a full third of his presidency</a> hobnobbing at his palatial resorts, which have locations in the poshest coastal destinations, from Palm Beach to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>The coastal elitism of this White House does not begin and end with Trump, though. He has surrounded himself with the coastal elite. It’s who and what he knows best.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/donald-trump-melania-1514482010.jpg\"><img alt=\"WATER MILL, NY - AUGUST 18:  Donald Trump and Model Melania Trump visit the Mercedes-Benz Bridgehampton Polo Challenge at the Bridgehampton Polo Club on August 18, 2007 in Water Mill, New York.

And why not? Cohn, after all, left on good terms, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-gary-cohn-285-million-departure-package.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=097290E5F94389BCEF9A995A250FBBAC&gwt=pay\">receiving a $285 million payout</a> after his term as president there. Like Ross, Cohn is the <a href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/executive-covets-goldman-seat-where-a-friend-snugly-sits/?mtrref=www.google.com\">very picture of a New York, coastal elite</a>: He owns a vacation home in the Hamptons and has called Manhattan home for decades.</p>\n<p>It’d be hard to top the coastal elitism of Steven Mnuchin — Trump’s secretary of the treasury. If you’ve seen Mnuchin’s name in the news recently, it’s likely because <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/25/a-gift-wrapped-package-of-poo-why-a-man-left-a-box-of-manure-for-steven-mnuchin/?utm_term=.9b683b64494f\">a man sent a Christmas present full of manure to his Los Angeles mansion</a> … in Bel-Air, a pretty swank neighborhood. For all the conservatives railing against Hollywood, Mnuchin was a producer <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2016/11/30/trump-treasury-pick-steven-mnuchin-has-ties-to-bel-air-hollywood-pasadena/\">on at least 34 different blockbuster films</a>. He just bought <a href=\"https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/55622-u-s-treasury-secretary-forks-out-12-6-million-for-d-c-home\">a $12.6 million mansion</a> in D.C. Born in New York, Mnuchin’s father, Robert, worked for decades at Goldman Sachs. Steven followed him there and worked for Goldman for nearly 20 years before launching several hedge funds of his own. Like Cohn and Ross, Mnuchin also owns a palatial estate in the Hamptons, <a href=\"http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/steven-mnuchins-house-1/view/google/\">which he bought for $15 million in 2005</a>.</p>\n<p>Mnuchin’s latest wife, Louise Linton, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/louise-linton-instagram\">has struggled to conceal the couple’s coastal elitism</a> since her husband joined Trump’s staff. Again, if someone fictionalized her stereotypical snobbery, it would seem like overkill. She posted on Instagram a photo of herself getting off a government plane in Kentucky like it was a model shoot. In the caption, she hash-tagged the various brands of clothes she was sporting, including #hermes, #valentino, #roulandmouret, and #tomfordsunnies.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Louise Linton, Sec Mnuchin's wife, posts photo that tags Hermes/Tom Ford/Valentino as she leaves Air Force Jet then replies to a critic <a href=\"https://t.co/Uhjc7qBiEA\">pic.twitter.com/Uhjc7qBiEA</a></p>\n<p>— Yashar Ali ?

The last time I heard that type of snobbery was from the classic WWE character <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNz44PmbPKs\">the Million Dollar Man</a>, who was not at all rich but aimed to play the most exaggerated version of a rich man possible, often mocking the wages of those in the crowd.</p>\n<p>Before Trump, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-trump-cabinet/\">no president had ever had a single billionaire</a> serve in their first cabinet. Trump has two.</p>\n<p>One is Linda McMahon, who serves as the head of Trump’s Small Business Administration and was one of the largest donors to his campaign. McMahon’s Connecticut home <a href=\"https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/vince-mcmahon-house-mansion\">was valued at $40 million in 2006</a>. She also owns a vacation home in Boca Raton, Florida; a condo in Vegas; two condos in Stamford, Connecticut; another house in Greenwich, Connecticut; and a 47-foot yacht called “Sexy Bitch.”</p>\n<p>When billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is not in <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/09/betsy-devos-vacation-home-sparks-uproar-on-twitter.html\">her $10 million vacation home</a> in Michigan, she lives on her “compound” <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/01/dick_and_betsy_devos_enjoy_the.html\">in Vero Beach, Florida</a>. She owns 10 boats — <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/can-you-afford-betsy-devoss-lavish-lifestyle-708369\">including a mega $40 million 164-foot yacht</a>. Her family also owns four airplanes and two helicopters to get around. She travels on her own private jet even for government travel. Her family has full-time staff members who schedule and maintain their yacht and even help <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/11/09/report-finds-that-people-who-work-in-the-devos-family-office-have-some-pretty-odd-responsibilities/\">with toy repairs</a>.</p>\n<p>And the list goes on. Like Trump and many members of his cabinet, for instance, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/05/30/ben-carson-sheds-dramatic-south-florida-home/\">also has a mansion in Palm Beach</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps no two Trumpers are more hypocritical in their coastal elitism, though, than Trump’s Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller and former Chief Policy Director Steve Bannon, who also chaired Trump’s campaign. Both men have been frequently quoted calling out “coastal elites,” but they are the definition of coastal elites.</p>\n<p>Miller, for instance, <a href=\"http://beta.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-speechwriter-santamonica-20170117-story.html\">was born and raised in the liberal elite beach town</a> of Santa Monica, California. where he spent more than half of his life.</p>\n<p>Bannon, however, is a finalist for the top prize. For all his ranting about elites, populism, and people in the middle of America, the man is as phony as a $3 bill. Bannon weaves in and out of small southern towns, stumping for men like Roy Moore, like he understands the people he’s talking to. The reality is that he’s just playing them for power.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/donald-trump-melania-hollywood-star-2-1514482102.jpg\"><img alt=\"Donald Trump Jr., Donald Trump, Melania Trump and baby Barron Trump (Photo by Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage)\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/donald-trump-melania-hollywood-star-2-1514482102-1024x675.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164263\"></a>\n<p>Donald Trump was honored with a Hollywood Walk of Fame Star in 2007.

He regularly speaks out against the place like he didn’t come from it himself. Before he was in Hollywood, Bannon, too, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-steve-bannon-global-capitalist-20170331-story.html\">was at Goldman Sachs</a>. What’s wild is that while now he’s rich and speaks out against globalism, he made his money as a capitalist profiting off the global economy. His last three known addresses <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/inside-the-breitbart-embassy-where-bannon-parties-and-plots.html\">were in California, New York, and Florida</a>. He has a beachfront home <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/195846-where-does-steve-bannon-live-donald-trumps-chief-strategist-has-been-all-over-the-place\">in Laguna Beach, California</a>. He frequently lives and works out of <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/195846-where-does-steve-bannon-live-donald-trumps-chief-strategist-has-been-all-over-the-place\">a 14-room, multimillion-dollar townhouse</a> in D.C. that is owned by a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/breitbarts-washington-landlord-has-had-colorful-political-ca?utm_term=.eaNArZdrpP#.wuavPNRPxD\">former member of Egypt’s Parliament</a>.</p>\n<p>While Bannon is a standout example of the hypocrisy at the center of Republicans’ attacks on coastal elites, it may be better to close out with Paul Manafort, he of the indicted variety. Manafort, Trump’s longtime friend and former campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/11/01/561330641/what-manaforts-indictment-reveals-his-new-york-city-real-estate-deals\">owned at least three multimillion-dollar homes in</a> New York — including his part-time residence in Trump Tower. Each seemed to be bought with money that was laundered from shady consulting work completed around the world. Manafort owned a brownstone in Brooklyn, a condo in SoHo, and, like many other Trump team members, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/11/01/561330641/what-manaforts-indictment-reveals-his-new-york-city-real-estate-deals\">a lavish 10-bedroom estate in the Hamptons</a>. He spent $1 million alone on the landscaping and security system for his Hamptons mansion. Manafort also owned a home in Arlington, Virginia, and a condo nearby in Alexandria. In a deal to avoid house arrest, it appears Manafort is going to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/paul-manafort-might-be-moving-to-florida-if-his-house-arrest-ends-2518000109.html\">be allowed to move to his Florida home in Palm Beach</a>, just miles down the road from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.</p>\n<p>For the purported enemies of the coastal elite, Trump and his team sure spend a lot of time ferrying between the Hamptons and Palm Beach.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana, pose for a portrait in their home, Mar-a-Lago, with their household staff behind them in 1987.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/29/coastal-elites-republicans-trump-administration/\">Republicans Mock “Coastal Elites,” But the Trump Administration Is Full of Them</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Republicans in Congress</u> spent the year crafting historically unpopular legislation. First, they tried, tried, tried to pass health care reform, eventually giving up because the bills were so disastrous that even some Republicans could not get behind them. And then came the tax bill, which they passed just before Christmas even though a mere one-third of Americans said they supported the legislation, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-tax-cuts-are-even-more-unpopular-than-past-tax-hikes/\">according to</a> the political polling website FiveThirtyEight.</p>\n<p>That the majority of Americans opposed the rewrite of the tax code did little to persuade GOP lawmakers to put on the brakes; <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/the-12-house-republicans-who-voted-against-the-tax-bill\">just 12 of them</a> voted “no,” and almost all of them were from blue states or swing districts. For instance, bill opponent Rep. Darrell Issa is from a California district that he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/california-house-district-49-issa-applegate\">won by less than 1 percent</a> in the last election.</p>\n<p>There was a single Republican opponent of the bill, however, who comfortably won his last election and is from a state that elected Trump in 2016. Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., perhaps the last ideologically moderate Republican in the House, also voted against the health care overhaul Republicans proposed earlier this year. He is the only House Republican not serving in either a blue state or swing district who opposed both landmark GOP bills.</p>\n<p>Jones faces no real threat of being defeated by a Democratic opponent, one factor that sometimes spurs Republicans to vote against their party. In 2016, he <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Walter_Jones\">won re-election by almost 34 points</a>. He does, however, face opposition from other Republicans.</p>\n<p>Wake Forest University professor John Dinan, who studies North Carolina politics, told The Intercept that Jones’s vote was no surprise.</p>\n<p>“Walter Jones has for some time now been a thorn in the side of Republican House leadership and has in a number of cases been unwilling to support the party’s consensus position on procedural votes and on the final substantive votes on key legislation,” Dinan said, pointing out that the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/246337-the-dozen-rebels-targeted-by-gop-leaders\">House leadership removed</a> Jones from the House Financial Services Committee in 2012. Jones was one of the only Republicans on Capitol Hill to support the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed under President Barack Obama, and he was <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-dodd-frank-repeal-20170608-story.html\">the only</a> House Republican to oppose repealing a key section of it this year.</p>\n<p>“I’m all for tax reform, but it must grow the economy, not the debt. Unfortunately, the tax bill voted on today will be financed not by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget, but by adding $2 trillion to America’s debt,” Jones said in a <a href=\"https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-%E2%80%9Ci%E2%80%99m-all-tax-reform-we-can%E2%80%99t-do-it-adding-trillions-debt%E2%80%9D-0\">statement</a> following the tax vote. “Much of that will be borrowed from potential foreign adversaries like China, and then put on the backs of American taxpayers. That’s an additional $20,000 debt burden on every household in America. With federal debt already at $20 trillion, and deficit spending adding $666 billion to that debt just this past year alone, this is the wrong way to deliver the tax relief that the American people need.”</p>\n<p>He delivered a similar <a href=\"https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones%E2%80%99-statement-american-health-care-act\">statement </a>after voting in opposition to the Republican health care bill, the American Health Care Act, in May:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now in 2017, for reasons I cannot understand, instead of moving a bill to repeal Obamacare and replace it with reforms that will fix our broken health care system, the Washington Republican leadership jammed a bill through the House that does neither. Furthermore, the rushed, behind-closed-doors process they’ve used is shameful. Over the past several weeks, they cut deal after deal to secure members’ support, and then pushed the bill to the floor without a CBO score. As a result, no one has any idea how much those deals will cost the American taxpayers, or how they might affect the cost, quality, and availability of health insurance coverage for American families.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also cited the human cost that his constituents would bear as well as strong opposition from his district. “There are many aspects of the bill that deeply trouble me because of their potential effects on eastern North Carolina and rural America,” Jones said, noting that 90 percent of his constituents who contacted him about the bill opposed it.</p>\n<p>But Jones has not always been a dissenter among Republicans. He was one of the lawmakers who, in anger at French refusal to support the U.S.-led war in Iraq, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2007/07/freedom-fries-creator-waves-goodbye-to-walter-jones-002068\">asked</a> the Capitol cafeteria to rename french fries to “freedom fries.”</p>\n<p>His ardent support for the war, however, fell apart as it became clear that the government’s justification for the invasion of Iraq was mythological. And he has since become a critic of all American wars. He consistently votes against foreign military involvement, and in the past 14 years, he has <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d4553a8e37b0434299713d4be95bb7f7\">penned 11,000 letters</a> to families of the fallen — not just in his own district but all over the country.</p>\n<p>While his party continues to lurch right on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is an opponent of Israel’s right-wing government, earlier this year <a href=\"http://jewishjournal.com/news/nation/jewishinsider/216877/meet-republican-congressman-calls-settlement-freeze/\">calling for a settlement freeze</a>.</p>\n<p>Republican elites have taken note. In 2014, hedge fund industry executives and <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/pro-israel-group-drops-brutal-ad-against-walter-jones/article/786422\">pro-Israel activists</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/walter-jones-taylor-griffin_n_5187262.html\">funded</a> a primary challenger who <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina%27s_3rd_Congressional_District_elections,_2014\">came within five points</a> of defeating Jones.</p>\n<p>As one of the last Republicans on Capitol Hill willing to buck his party on issues of war, health care, and finance, some expect he will have a target on his back in the near future from the establishment of his party.</p>\n<p>“It is no surprise, therefore, that Republicans, both in Washington, D.C. and in North Carolina, have been open to back other Republican primary candidates who might defeat Jones and be more willing to support the party on key policy priorities,” Dinan said. “A similar effort might well be made in the primary in 2018. These efforts resemble the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/huelskamp-defeated-in-kansas-primary-226603\">successful effort to defeat Tim Huelskamp</a> in a Kansas primary in 2016. Whether the efforts to defeat Jones in a 2018 primary prove any more effective is too soon to tell.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Rep.

Depois de três anos de privações, fazia apenas um mês que ele podia comer frutas frescas novamente. Mustafa e sua família são sobreviventes de um cerco.</p>\n<p>A mãe de Mustafa, Sara, de rosto macilento como o da filha adolescente, conta como eles conseguiram sobreviver. “O molho de tomate era vendido por grama”, diz Sara, cujo sobrenome não será revelado por motivos de segurança. “Nossa comida diária era arroz ou lentilha. Carne, frutas, legumes? Pode esquecer, isso não existia. Pode esquecer também geladeira, não tinha eletricidade. Pode esquecer tudo”, recorda. Apontando para Mustafa, ela pergunta: “Olhe só para ele. Ele parece um garoto de 12 anos normal? Olhe para as meninas. Elas parecem saudáveis?”</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Todas as crianças de Deir al-Zour são menores do que a média. </blockquote>\n<p>Mustafa parece ter oito ou nove anos. Todas as crianças de Deir al-Zour são menores do que a média. As filhas de Sara têm olheiras fundas, pele amarelada e maxilar ligeiramente afundado.</p>\n<p>Desde o fim de 2014, os moradores da cidade de Deir al-Zour, na Síria, foram praticamente isolados do mundo exterior, sitiados pelo Estado Islâmico (EI), que tentava consolidar seu domínio no norte da Síria e do Iraque. Água, combustível, eletricidade e canais de comunicação foram desaparecendo gradualmente. Produtos básicos, como chá, açúcar, carne e alimentos frescos se tornaram luxos inacessíveis, controlados por um punhado de aproveitadores querendo lucrar com o cerco.</p>\n<p>Depois de meses de intensos combates, o exército sírio e seus aliados romperam o bloqueio do EI no início de setembro. Mas as tropas sírias só conseguiram chegar à entrada principal da cidade três dias depois, pois os extremistas haviam coberto a área de minas terrestres.</p>\n<p>A cidade é a capital da região de mesmo nome. O EI também foi expulso do resto da província de Deir al-Zour depois de muitos meses de luta contra as tropas do governo sírio e seus aliados, de um lado, e as Forças Democráticas Sírias (as FDS, apoiadas pelos EUA), do outro. Atualmente, o controle da zona é dividido pelo Eufrates: o governo e seus aliados controlam o lado sul do rio; as FDS e seus aliados, o norte.</p>\n<p>Trechos da estrada para Deir al-Zour ainda ficaram sob poder do EI durante algumas semanas depois do fim do cerco, o que fez com que a cidade ficasse acessível apenas por via aérea. Entretanto, em meados de outubro, segundo funcionários do exército sírio, a ameaça inimiga na estrada foi eliminada. Caminhões de ajuda humanitária, civis e jornalistas podiam finalmente chegar à cidade por terra.</p>\n<p>O que antes era um agitado centro urbano de 700 mil habitantes agora é apenas uma sombra do passado. As ruas da cidade foram esburacadas por anos de bombardeios; seus edifícios estão em ruínas, destruídos ou simplesmente abandonados; e serviços básicos, como eletricidade e linhas de comunicação, ainda não voltaram a funcionar. A recepção de sinais de telefonia celular é esporádica, e a maioria das casas usam geradores ou grandes baterias. Um<a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/syria/publication/the-toll-of-war-the-economic-and-social-consequences-of-the-conflict-in-syria\"> relatório do Banco Mundial</a>, publicado em julho de 2017, estima que nenhuma outra região síria teve tantas casas destruídas pela guerra quanto a província de Deir al-Zour.</p>\n<p>Os moradores que ficaram – cerca de 100 mil em janeiro de 2017 – tiveram que enfrentar um duplo cerco: o externo, praticado pelo o Estado Islâmico, que impedia a entrada de pessoas e suprimentos na cidade; e o interno, realizado por pessoas que viam na miséria alheia uma oportunidade de lucro.</p>\n<p>Agora a população está cansada da guerra, subnutrida e frustrada. Embora alguns bairros se esforcem para que a vida volte ao normal, os moradores temem que, da mesma forma que havia sido ignorada durante o cerco, a cidade seja esquecida assim que a euforia da liberação passar.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Deir-Ezzor-explosion-1512577925.jpg\"><img alt=\"Smoke rises from buildings in the area of Bughayliyah, on the northern outskirts of Deir Ezzor on September 13, 2017, as Syrian forces advance during their ongoing battle against the Islamic State (IS) group.

Consequentemente, a população sofreu com a ganância dos aproveitadores dentro da cidade, ao mesmo tempo em que tentava se defender de ataques, infiltrações e investidas do EI, que queria controlar a cidade para consolidar seu domínio sobre a região.</p>\n<p>No início da insurreição contra o presidente Bashar al-Assad, em 2011, Deir al-Zour, um dos focos de resistência das forças de oposição,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/world/middleeast/08syria.html?pagewanted=all\"> foi atacada</a> pelo exército sírio. Em 2013, a cidade foi dominada pelos rebeldes da Frente Nusra e outros grupos, que enfrentavam outras facções rebeldes e as ofensivas do governo. Em 2014, o Estado Islâmico assumiu o controle de boa parte do entorno da cidade, iniciando um cerco que duraria até setembro de 2017.</p>\n<p>Para ir de Damasco a Deir al-Zour são nove horas de estrada através de uma vasta região desértica. Quem faz o trajeto percebe que muito ainda precisa ser feito para que os moradores voltem a ter uma vida normal depois da expulsão do EI e da oposição síria pelas tropas do governo. Palmira, a última grande cidade retomada – pela segunda vez – das garras do EI, em março de 2017, ainda está em ruínas, praticamente desabitada. Nas ruas, milícias pró-Assad – dos libaneses do Hezbollah aos afegãos do <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/25/syria-iran-afghan-refugees/\">Fatemiyoun</a> e os próprios sírios – ocupam todos os espaços, com cada grupo confiscando as poucas residências que restaram, enquanto as tropas russas vigiam as ruínas históricas.</p>\n<p>A maioria dos veículos que atravessam Palmira é militar. Os russos estão na cidade, junto com o exército sírio e grupos paramilitares pró-governo. Caminhões cheios de combatentes sírios, libaneses e afegãos passam pelas ruas, com suas bandeiras tremulando ao vento. Um posto de controle na estrada principal entre a província de Homs e o nordeste da Síria – onde se encontram Deir al-Zour, Al Mayadeen e Abu Kamal – é ocupado por um soldado sírio, um russo e um afegão. Na entrada da cidade de Sukhnah, retomada recentemente, existe um enorme cartaz onde se lê “morte aos EUA e a Israel”, com bandeiras do Fatemiyoun nas extremidades.</p>\n<p>Nos arredores de Deir al-Zour, a paisagem é dominada por pequenos conjuntos abandonados de casas térreas de telhado achatado. Depois de passar o posto de controle principal do exército sírio, o viajante se depara com um mosaico cheio de peças faltando, com uma mensagem de boas-vindas. Segundo os moradores e o exército sírio, ainda existem minas no amplo deserto que rodeia a entrada da cidade, o que torna a caminhada perigosa. Após um segundo posto de controle, uma grande estátua dá as boas-vindas a visitantes inexistentes – ninguém vem até aqui, pois os franco-atiradores do EI ainda estão à espreita.</p>\n<p>Nas áreas residenciais da cidade, há postos de controle do exército sírio por toda parte. Jipes carregam jovem soldados – uma mistura de tropas oficiais sírias e forças locais pró-Assad – de um bairro a outro para seus afazeres diários. Os soldados vigiam atentamente o que restou de Deir al-Zour. Nos subúrbios a oeste da cidade, bairros inteiros foram destruídos – são as enormes cicatrizes da presença dos combatentes do EI e das batalhas que os expulsaram.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Deir-Ezzor-Souk-market-1512579559.jpg\"><img alt=\"Deir-Ezzor-Souk-market-1512579559\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Deir-Ezzor-Souk-market-1512579559-1000x750.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-161195\"></a>\n<p>Mercado de Deir al-Zour, à noite.</p>\n<p>Foto: Nour Samaha</p></div>\n<p><u>Recentemente</u>, o mercado da Rua Wadi, em Deir al-Zour, voltou a ficar cheio à noite. A cidade estava às escuras, à exceção de algumas lâmpadas a bateria. Ainda ouviam-se algumas explosões à distância, abafando o ruído dos geradores, mas isso não impedia as pessoas de socializar. Antes da expulsão do EI, as bombas dos extremistas obrigavam a população a correr em busca de abrigo para não inflar ainda mais as estatísticas de civis mortos em 2017 durante a batalha pelo controle da cidade. Agora, os cafés estavam novamente cheios de fumaça e do burburinho de jovens fumando narguilé, em torno dos poucos televisores ainda em funcionamento. Outros paravam nas barracas do mercado para examinar os alimentos frescos, já não tão raros quanto antes.</p>\n<p>As conversas sobre os <em>tujjar</em> – palavra árabe para negociantes ou qualquer pessoa que cobra dinheiro por alguma coisa, inclusive serviços – circulam entre os fregueses do mercado; moradores, comerciantes e até crianças falam sobre a vida sob “o cerco de fora e o cerco de dentro”, nas palavras de um dos feirantes.</p>\n<p>Na maioria das vezes, os <em>tujjar</em> eram locais – habitantes da cidade ou das redondezas – que se aproveitavam do cerco do EI. Tudo era negociado: de pão, trigo, arroz, triguilho e comida enlatada a ajuda humanitária, diesel, óleo, autorizações governamentais e vagas em aviões e helicópteros de resgate. Todo tipo de pessoa podia ser um <em>tujjar</em>. Alguns eram membros de gangues que haviam entrado para vários grupos das Forças de Defesa Nacional, uma milícia pró-Assad; outros, como <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-wheat-islamic-st/how-a-businessman-struck-a-deal-with-islamic-state-to-help-assad-feed-syrians-idUSKBN1CG0EL\">Hossam Qaterji</a>, eram poderosos homens de negócios que organizavam a distribuição das ajudas recebidas pelo ar e supostamente negociavam trigo com o Estado Islâmico.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Quando a noite vinha, as gangues pilhavam os bairros e casas de quem havia fugido.</blockquote>\n<p>Sara relata como os <em>tujjar</em> enchiam os bolsos: “A ajuda aérea era recolhida pelos <em>tujjar</em> e dividida em duas; uma metade era deixada em galpões até estragar [para aumentar os preços], e a outra era vendida a preços exorbitantes nos mercados. Eles também são responsáveis pelo nosso sofrimento”, explica.</p>\n<p>Quando a noite vinha, as gangues pilhavam os bairros e casas de quem havia fugido. Um morador conta que um vizinho dele viu sua cozinha inteira – inclusive a geladeira – sendo vendida na caçamba de uma picape em uma cidade vizinha.</p>\n<p>“Agora as picapes vêm de Al Mayadeen cheias de coisas roubadas também”, diz Abu Mohammad, que não quis informar seu nome verdadeiro por motivos de segurança. “Essas gangues fizeram a mesma coisa aqui na nossa cidade”, conta.</p>\n<p>“Tudo estava à venda em Deir al-Zour”, explica Mohammed Saleh Alftayeh, um estudioso da política e do exército sírios nascido na cidade. “Todo mundo tinha alguma coisa de que outros precisavam”, diz.</p>\n<p>Para que um funcionário do governo pudesse sair da cidade, por exemplo, era preciso uma autorização oficial, e ela tinha um preço. Depois de sair, o tal funcionário teria que pagar para atravessar os postos de controle nos arredores da cidade; para embarcar em um helicóptero ou avião de carga, cobrava-se ainda mais. E, com o passar do tempo, todas essas “taxas” só aumentavam.</p>\n<p>Em fevereiro de 2015, o preço de uma vaga em um avião ou helicóptero girava em torno de 25.000 SYP por pessoa – cerca de R$ 330 à época –, segundo vários moradores de dentro e de fora da cidade, alguns dos quais pagaram por esse tipo de resgate. No outono de 2015, quando as tropas do EI se aproximaram do aeroporto, os aviões de carga pararam de decolar. A partir de então, só aeronaves de pequeno porte – e, portanto, com menos lugares – podiam sair da cidade, o que fez os preços dispararem. Em outubro de 2015, a taxa havia decuplicado. Uma família de três pessoas teria que pagar 700.000 SYP para ser evacuada. Mesmo assim, a lista de espera era longa. Quem não podia pagar o resgate aéreo arriscava a vida tentando atravessar o território do EI por terra.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Deir-Ezzor-hospital-isis-crop-1512756821-e1512757053127.jpg\"><img alt=\"Deir-Ezzor-hospital-isis-crop-1512756821\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Deir-Ezzor-hospital-isis-crop-1512756821-e1512757053127-1000x695.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-161640\"></a>\n<p>Vista da janela de um hospital.

Mas, depois de terem sido praticamente esquecidos durante o cerco, os habitantes temem que suas necessidades sejam novamente desconsideradas na hora de reconstruir a cidade.</p>\n<p>“Duvido que o governo priorize a reconstrução [de Deir al-Zour]”, diz Alftayeh. Ele cita como exemplo a retomada, em dezembro de 2016, da cidade de Aleppo, devastada pela guerra. “Quase um ano depois, o governo ainda não organizou nenhum esforço de reconstrução. Enquanto não houver financiamento internacional, duvido que tenhamos uma iniciativa séria de recuperação da cidade de Deir al-Zour, onde a destruição foi imensa”, acredita.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">“Vai levar 10 anos até a vida voltar ao normal aqui.”</blockquote>\n<p>Embora a volta dos antigos moradores seja esperada, poucos retornaram às suas casas dois meses depois do fim do cerco. “Haverá um fluxo de retorno, em parte porque a zona que era controlada pelo governo está em melhor estado do que as outras e pode acomodar mais gente. Além disso, o governo quer que os refugiados internos voltem às suas cidades de origem, inclusive a Deir al-Zour”, prevê Alftayeh.</p>\n<p>No fim de setembro, <a href=\"http://kassiounpaper.com/syria/item/32015-2017-09-30-13-08-20\">o governo decretou</a> que todos os funcionários públicos deveriam voltar a seus postos de trabalho em até um mês; no caso de Deir al-Zour, o prazo foi estendido para o fim deste ano.</p>\n<p>Algumas organizações humanitárias estão impacientes para a volta dos funcionários públicos, inclusive em Deir al-Zour. “Os trabalhadores do setor público costumam pertencer às classes mais pobres, e são eles que fornecem os serviços básicos necessários para o funcionamento de qualquer comunidade”, diz um servidor que trabalha com uma organização internacional na Síria. Ele pediu anonimato por não ter autorização para falar com a imprensa. “Queremos que eles voltem logo”, afirma.</p>\n<p>Mas quem ficou na cidade e teve que enfrentar o cerco não está tão otimista com relação ao futuro. Haifaa, uma moradora do bairro de Qusour que foi obrigada a ficar quando o marido partiu para Damasco em busca de tratamento médico para seu filho, diz: “Vai levar 10 anos até a vida voltar ao normal aqui.”</p>\n<p>Foto do título: Moradores desalojados de Deir al-Zour se dirigem aos campos de refugiados nos arredores de Raqqa, no dia 24 de setembro de 2017, enquanto combatentes sírios, com o apoio de forças especiais americanas, lutam para eliminar os últimos soldados do Estado Islâmico da cidade.</p>\n<p><em>Tradução: Bernardo Tonasse</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/29/a-cidade-siria-que-viveu-tres-anos-sob-o-cerco-do-estado-islamico/\">A cidade síria que viveu três anos sob o cerco do Estado Islâmico</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span><u>The Environmental Protection</u> Agency has tasked a banker who was banned from the banking industry for life with oversight of the nation’s Superfund program.</span></p>\n<p><span>In May, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fined Oklahoma banker Albert Kelly $125,000. According to a </span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4336500-2017-11-17-08-59-12.html\"><span>consent order</span></a><span>, which The Intercept obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the FDIC had “reason to believe that [Kelly] violated a law or regulation, by entering into an agreement pertaining to a loan by the Bank without FDIC approval.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Two weeks later, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt appointed Kelly to lead an effort to streamline the Superfund program. In July, the FDIC went further, banning Kelly from banking for life. The “order of prohibition from further participation” explained that the FDIC had determined Kelly’s “unfitness to serve as a director, officer, person participating in the conduct of the affairs or as an institution-affiliated party of the Bank, any other insured depository institution.”</span></p>\n<p><span>But Pruitt, who had received loans from Kelly’s bank, apparently didn’t find Kelly’s unfitness to serve in the financial industry as disqualifying his longtime friend from serving as a top official at the EPA. </span><span>Since May, Kelly, or Kell as he was known in Oklahoma, has led the effort to streamline the Superfund program — </span><span>which oversees remediation of some of the country’s most toxic sites</span><span>.</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Kelly would become a senior adviser in the federal environmental agency despite having no previous experience with environmental issues.</blockquote>\n<p><span>Pruitt earned only $38,400 as an Oklahoma state senator. Even with a $35,000 profit from selling his previous home, that was not enough on its own to buy a house in the Lakes at Indian Springs community in Broken Arrow, the suburb of Tulsa that Pruitt represented in the legislature.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet in 2004, Pruitt purchased a sprawling ranch house in the upscale gated community for $605,000. Located on a half-acre corner lot in the Lakes, his stately Tudor looked out on a manmade lake and had a stone fireplace, parking for five cars, and a storm-safe room.</span></p>\n<p><span>To help pay for it, Pruitt </span><span>turned to SpiritBank — a community bank that Kelly’s family had run since the 1930s. SpiritBank gave Pruitt and his wife three mortgage loans: one for $81,000, another for $359,000, and a third for $533,000. His wife, Marlyn Pruitt, has reported no assets or income.</span></p>\n<p><span>The year before, SpiritBank had also loaned Pruitt money to help buy a share of the Oklahoma City RedHawks, a minor league baseball team. That deal was made in partnership with a local businessman named Robert Funk, co-founder of an employment company.</span></p>\n<p><span>On May 22, Pruitt returned the favor to the Oklahoma banker with his </span><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-superfund-task-force\"><span>announce</span></a><span><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-superfund-task-force\">ment</a> that he would be creating the Superfund task force — and appointing </span><span>Kelly to head it.</span></p>\n<p><span>The appointment was notable in that Kelly would become a senior adviser in the federal environmental agency despite having no previous experience with environmental issues. </span><span>A business major with a law degree and a 200-head cattle ranch, Kelly listed motivational speaking and political activity among the core competencies on his</span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3729025-Albert-Kelly-Redacted.html\"> <span>resume</span></a><span>. The descendant of a long line of bankers and Republicans, Kelly had worked at his family’s bank for the previous 33 years.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is unclear whether Spirit’s loans to Pruitt violated the bank’s lending standards, both because those standards aren’t public and because Pruitt may have used assets and income as collateral that don’t appear in public records. Pruitt, Kelly, and the EPA declined to comment or answer questions for this story. </span></p>\n<p><span>For Kelly, who has contributed to Pruitt’s campaigns on at least three occasions, the appointment came just as he found himself in need of a job. Few knew at the time that the banking scion was already well on his way to being forced out of his family business, which had been run by his uncle and grandfather before him — and being banned from banking altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span><u>The FDIC’s order</u> of prohibition against Kelly provided a few more details about what the banker had done to get himself banned from banking for life — a dubious distinction that befell 96 bankers in 2016. (The 2017 figures are not yet available.) The FDIC has been known to levy this penalty on certain bankers convicted of criminal fraud. And the federal regulator has also issued lifetime banking</span><a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/failed-bank-settlements-may-bring-unwelcome-surprise\"> <span>bans</span></a><span> for some leaders of failed banks.</span></p>\n<p><span>According to the order Kelly signed, his violation “</span><span>of law or regulation, unsafe or unsound practice, and or breach of fiduciary duty” caused the bank financial loss or other damage. It had also involved his “willful or continuing disregard for the safety or soundness of the Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite repeated FOIA requests from The Intercept, the FDIC has declined to release more information about the particular violations that led to Kelly’s fine and lifetime ban from banking. <span>But public records show that SpiritBank suffered significant losses under his leadership, going at least as far back as 2007. At its peak, the bank had $1.5 billion in assets, according to Kelly’s resume, which does not indicate when that was the case. Today, it has less than half that amount — just over $700 million.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Clearly some of its troubles had to do with making bad mortgages — home loans that borrowers were unable to pay back. The “troubled asset ratio” is a number that approximates a bank’s stability by comparing the amount of troubled assets to its holdings that bank regulators consider solid. Generally, the higher the measure, the more stress a bank is under because of lenders who are not paying on time. In 2007, SpiritBank’s</span><a href=\"https://banktracker.investigativereportingworkshop.org/banks/oklahoma/tulsa/spiritbank/\"> <span>troubled asset ratio</span></a><span> reached 34, meaning just over one-third of its holdings were troubled. Nationwide, the median troubled asset ratio for banks at the time was 12.</span></p>\n<p><span>In March 2009, SpiritBank received $30 million from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a federal effort to breathe new life into troubled banks by buying up some of their bad loans. SpiritBank decided to participate in the program “because we see it as an opportunity to help Oklahoma,” Kelly</span><a href=\"http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/tulsabusiness/business_news/henke-rusco-promoted-at-american-bank-trust/article_07380231-99ae-5c1d-afa4-55909822f158.html\"> <span>said</span></a><span> at the time. “</span><span>Because SpiritBank is one of the state’s strongest banks and because of our unique position in providing home mortgage financing across the state, we are well-positioned to deploy this money to stimulate the Oklahoma economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet SpiritBank’s finances only got shakier in the years after it received the federal bailout funds, which the bank used to make even more mortgages. “The added capital resulted in approximately $400 million of additional residential mortgage loans funded in 2009,” as the bank made clear in a </span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4336506-SpiritBank-SigTARP-Survey-2009.html\"><span>report</span></a><span> to the Treasury that year. In 2010, the bank made </span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4336502-SPIRITBANK-SigTARP-Survey-2010.html\"><span>more mortgages</span></a><span> and its troubled asset ratio climbed to over 60.</span></p>\n<p><span>The next year, as SpiritBank </span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4336503-SPIRITBANK-SigTARP-Survey-2011.html\"><span>continued</span></a><span> to make mortgages, Kelly was named chairman of the </span><span>American Bankers Association. Tom Coburn, then one of the state’s senators, commended Kelly on the appointment, describing him as “the most influential nonpolitician in Oklahoma.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Once he became chair of the ABA, Kelly spoke out against the federal regulation of banking, a position Pruitt shared out of concern, he said, for community banks. Kelly was also chair of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, a powerful entity in charge of building</span> <span>the state’s roads.</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">FDIC’s order of prohibition against Kelly provided a few more details about what the banker had done to get himself banned from banking for life — a dubious distinction that befell 96 bankers in 2016.</blockquote>\n<p><span>Yet even as Kelly’s public profile rose, his bank continued to falter. In the first quarter of 2012, Spiritbank’s troubled asset ratio topped 70 and the FDIC stepped in to try to stabilize it. That year, in a </span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4336507-2012-Consent-Order-FDIC.html\"><span>consent order</span></a> <span>with the FDIC and the Oklahoma State Banking Department, the bank agreed to 25 improvements to its practices. Among the changes to be instituted were requirements that loans “be supported by current credit information and collateral documentation” and that loans to bank executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders “be thoroughly reviewed.” The order also specified that the bank “shall retain qualified management” and that it come up with a policy for overseeing the business and entertainment expenses of its directors, officers, and employees, which had apparently gotten out of hand.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the peak of the subprime crisis, the median troubled asset ratio of banks nationwide was 15.1. By the end of 2012, even after the infusion of federal dollars, SpiritBank’s troubled asset ratio had reached 75. While</span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list\"> <span>most</span></a><span> banks paid the Treasury back for the funds they’d gotten through the TARP program with</span><span> interest</span><span>, SpiritBank was unable to reimburse the government for more than $21 million of the $30 million it had received. Taxpayers lost</span><a href=\"https://www.sigtarp.gov/Quarterly%20Reports/October_26_2016_Report_To_Congress.pdf\"> <span>70 percent</span></a><span> of the money they laid out for SpiritBank, making it one of TARP’s worst investments. </span></p>\n<p><span>Most bankers who failed to repay TARP funds were not penalized for their financial irresponsibility — and it is unclear whether this was the reason for Kelly’s forced exit from banking. Yet, some Oklahomans did pay a price for the bad loans.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Minorities were disproportionately affected,” according to Angela Gobar, an academic who has</span><a href=\"http://coas.howard.edu/centeronraceandwealth/reports&amp;publications/032012-oklahoma-mortgage-lending-patterns.pdf\"> <span>studied</span></a><span> the mortgage crisis in Oklahoma. Gobar found that most subprime loans were made to borrowers in the middle and upper income brackets — people who might have qualified for loans that were on more favorable terms.</span></p>\n<p><span>“One of the things that was so illuminating to me was income didn’t” determine who banks targeted for unfavorable loans, said Gobar, whose study found elevated foreclosure rates in census tracts with higher concentrations of residents of color. “African-Americans who could have afforded a prime loan were steered by these institutions to get subprime loans.”</span></p>\n<p><span>When he was Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt</span><a href=\"http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/facing-foreclosure-couple-s-case-drags-on/article_6e2bddde-7467-5d3b-befb-ed86658c19de.html\"> <span>opted out</span></a><span> of a federal program that would have helped some of these foreclosure victims. In 2012, when the federal government and 49 state attorneys general launched the National Mortgage Settlement to offer relief to people who lost their homes in the crisis, Oklahoma became the only state to reject its share of $1.5 billion earmarked for individuals. Pruitt, who had been elected the state’s attorney general in 2010, declined more than $10 million that would have gone to foreclosure victims in Oklahoma on the grounds that it penalized financially responsible homeowners.</span></p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/albert-kelly-house-1514408952.jpg\"><img alt=\"albert-kelly-house-1514408952\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/albert-kelly-house-1514408952-1024x609.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164227\"></a>\n<p>A January 2016 Google Street View shows Scott Pruitt’s home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>Photo: Google, Inc.</p></div>\n<p><span>At least one recipient of a questionable loan survived the mortgage crisis unscathed. In 2012, Pruitt sold his house in the Lakes at Indian Springs. He lost $62,000 on the deal, a modest setback considering the magnitude of the financial crisis that was then barely in the country’s rearview mirror.</span></p>\n<p><span>The same year, while the FDIC was trying to stabilize SpiritBank, Pruitt bought an even bigger and grander house — a stone mansion with more than 5,000 square feet of living space and three chimneys. By then, Pruitt was already Oklahoma attorney general, a job that pays $132,825 a year. </span><span>Still, he needed another loan. This time, he got an $850,000 adjustable rate mortgage from the Bank of Oklahoma. Though Pruitt now lives in Washington at an undisclosed address, he still owns his home in Tulsa. The interest rate on his mortgage is due to shoot up in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, the program under Kelly’s guidance is having money problems of its own. Although Scott Pruitt claims he is making Superfund a priority, he has also proposed cutting its budget. </span></p>\n<p><span>“There’s a total lack of congruence between what they say they’re going to do and what’s happening to the agency’s staffing,” said Tom Voltaggio, who </span><span>directed the EPA’s Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program in the Mid-Atlantic states</span><span> for more than two decades. “It’s all just B.S.”</span></p>\n<p><span>For his part, Kelly is doing all right. At the helm of the program his friend Pruitt holds up as evidence that he cares about the environment, the banished banker now earns $172,100. </span></p>\n<p>Top photo: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, left, and Albert Kelly, senior adviser, visit Bird Creek on the Chapman Ranch in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, on May 26, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/28/scott-pruitt-failed-banker-running-epa-superfund-program/\">Banned From the Banking Industry for Life, a Scott Pruitt Friend Finds a New Home at the EPA</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>In late January,</u> George Papadopoulos did what a lot of Americans do when FBI agents ask for a few minutes of their time — he agreed to talk. It’s a decision he likely regrets, because in October the former adviser to President Donald Trump’s election campaign pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI. He is now a key figure in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>The court files in the Papadopoulos case say little about the conditions of his chat with the two FBI agents. We don’t know how long it lasted, where in Chicago it took place, what its tenor was, or whether Papadopoulos was aware the agents probably knew the answers to most questions they asked. One thing, though, is clear: Papadopoulos engaged in a form of self-harming behavior that defense lawyers always advise against — saying “yes” when a pair of friendly FBI agents knock on your door and ask to chat.</p>\n<p>His interrogation was recorded but the transcript has not been released, so it’s impossible to know precisely what the FBI agents might have said that gave Papadopoulos the impression it would be in his interests to talk and to lie. But in another high-profile case, involving former NSA contractor Reality Winner, the government released a transcript of the interrogation. It provides a verbatim example — and a rare example — of how FBI agents ingratiate themselves with unsuspecting suspects and intimidate them into saying things that bring doom upon them.</p>\n<p>The interrogations of Winner and Papadopoulos were what the FBI likes to call “noncustodial,” so they were not read their Miranda rights — because, the FBI claims, they were not arrested or detained at the time of the interrogation. (Winner’s lawyers have <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/01/reality-winner-miranda-rights-trial-confession-nsa-leaker/\">argued in court filings</a> that she was effectively detained and should have been Mirandized.) By avoiding the obligation to inform suspects of their right to a lawyer and the right to stay silent, the FBI makes it easier to get Americans to say things — whether truths or lies — that will be used against them. The Fifth Amendment protects people from testifying against themselves, of course, and the Sixth Amendment provides the right to legal counsel, but law enforcement authorities get around these constitutional protections by contending that some interrogations are noncustodial. The result is that suspects are enticed into talking before they realize the jeopardy they face and the rights they possess.</p>\n<p>“Because warnings are only required prior to custodial interrogation, one way to minimize the impact of Miranda on investigations is to try to conduct interrogations whenever possible in noncustodial settings (such as the suspect’s home or on the street, without arrest-like restraints),” notes an <a href=\"http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2009/01/non-custodial-stationhouse-interrogations.aspx\">article</a> in Police Magazine, which caters to the law enforcement community. The article bore the headline “How to talk to suspects without Mirandizing.”</p>\n<p>There’s a problem with that kind of advice — the presence of law enforcement officers can turn homes and sidewalks into coercive environments, making the distinction between “custodial” and “noncustodial” a murky if not artificial one. The Winner transcript, which was released in September, offers an unusual look inside one of these home interrogations. In its early we’re-on-your-side phase, the interrogation pivoted on Winner’s love of dogs and her CrossFit workouts.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/reality-winner-1513811236.jpg\"><img alt=\"Accused leaker Reality Winner leaves the U.S. District Courthouse in Augusta, Ga., following a bond hearing Thursday afternoon June 8, 2017.

It can be relatively innocuous, in the eyes of the law, to mishandle classified information — it might not even be a crime, if the information is not too serious and the reasons for mishandling it not too nefarious. But this wasn’t, in the eyes of the FBI, an innocuous case. Garrick, who asked most of the questions, is a specialist in espionage and counterintelligence, according to court documents. The government’s charging documents make clear that at the time of her interrogation, Winner was suspected of what the government was treating (probably cynically) as a very serious offense that jeopardized national security. The interrogation ended with Winner being arrested and charged under the draconian 1917 Espionage Act.</p>\n<p>The agents did not mention the Espionage Act while they talked with her. And they did not hint at the possible prison-for-a-decade consequences of what they suspected she had done: mail a classified NSA document to a media outlet. On June 5, the day Winner’s arrest was belatedly announced, The Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/\">published a story</a> based on a leaked NSA document detailing Russian attempts at cyberattacks against the U.S. election infrastructure. Though The Intercept has <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/06/statement-on-justice-department-allegations/\">no knowledge</a> of who sent the document, several publications reported that Winner mailed it to The Intercept, which has published a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/\">statement</a> about its role in the case.</p>\n<p>Her interrogation on June 3 began innocently enough. The first few minutes revolved around making her house safe for agents who would search it, which meant making sure her dog wouldn’t bite anyone, and making sure her guns (she had three) were secured. The conversation then took a decidedly casual turn.</p>\n<p>“How long have you had your dog?” Garrick asked.</p>\n<p>“She’s actually a foster,” Winner replied. “I’m rehabilitating her so hopefully she can get adopted later on.”</p>\n<p>“How old is she?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, we don’t really know. She’s one of those.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” Garrick said. “One of my dogs was a rescue and when I got him … I was the only guy who could touch him.” He later added, “If you can tell, we’re all dog people.”</p>\n<p>Garrick mentioned that his dog urinated “all over the place” at the outset, but eventually got used to its new home and started licking all visitors. Winner replied that her dog had been kept in a kennel and neglected her whole life. As they chatted, the other FBI agent, Wallace Taylor, offered to put her groceries into her refrigerator.</p>\n<p>The conversation turned to her service in the Air Force. Once more, the agents employed convivial banter. When Winner mentioned that she was stuck for four years in a Maryland posting, one of the FBI agents said, “I can beat you. You know where my first Air Force assignment was?”</p>\n<p>“What?” Winner asked.</p>\n<p>“Minot, North Dakota.”</p>\n<p>They made jokes about the cold weather — the transcript is interspersed with parenthetical descriptions of laughter — and then Garrick spoke about one of his FBI postings.</p>\n<p>“I was seven years in D.C., and that was about six and a half too long,” he cracked.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah, D.C.,” Winner said.</p>\n<p>“They keep asking if I want to go up there,” Garrick said. “I’m like, ‘Uh, no. No. No thank you.’ I’m done with that.”</p>\n<p>Garrick inquired about her CrossFit workout routine.</p>\n<p>“I did it for like six months, and I hurt myself,” Garrick offered. “Just every single day was pain.”</p>\n<p>The transcript of their CrossFit conversation goes on for more than two pages, with idle chat about box jumps and stress fractures and bench pressing (“So power lifting … what’s your favorite stuff?”). It’s a classic tactic of softening up a target, creating a false sense that the agents are your friends rather than, as often turns out to be the case, soon-to-be witnesses against you in court.</p>\n<p>“You’re trying to get information from somebody, so being confrontational, bellicose, threatening — for the most part is counterproductive,” notes Jeffrey Danik, a retired FBI agent who spent nearly three decades investigating white-collar crimes, violent crimes, and terrorism. “You can’t let them start thinking that this is some kind of confrontational, confinement-ending interview.” That goes for all types of suspects, he said, whether a bank teller who purloined $100, or a serial rapist with a dozen victims. “It’s how 99 percent of them go,” Danik told me. In an email, he added, “When they are friendly, which they usually are, it really defuses people’s anxiety.”</p>\n<p>The feigned friendliness of FBI agents is not just a matter of getting people to loosen up. One of the government’s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4336294-DOJ-on-Custodial-Interrogation-12-18-2017.html\">briefs</a> in the Winner case argues that by being “exceedingly friendly” and always keeping their voices at a “conversational level” and carrying “no visible weapons,” the agents acted in a way that created a noncustodial environment. It’s a law enforcement twofer: By acting polite, law enforcement agents persuade people to talk and lift from themselves the obligation to inform people of their right not to talk. In a way, FBI interrogations are akin to con games, with the mark played by ordinary citizens whose interests are not actually served by chatting with law enforcement agents pretending they’d just like to clear up a minor misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>“Good interviewers have an instinct to find some connection with the person you are interviewing and try to make them comfortable,” said Mike German, a retired FBI agent who is now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. “You want to have the person you’re interviewing in a cooperative mood. People tend to cooperate with people they have some positive feeling for. The ability to make a personal connection in a short period of time is a valuable talent.”</p>\n<p>Much of the time, it’s a strategy devised in advance by agents who know what topics will appeal to the suspect they are trying to loosen up.</p>\n<p>“The advantage for an FBI investigator is that you have a tremendous amount of information available to you, much more than the person you’re talking to,” German said. “I’m sure they knew a tremendous amount about her and what those areas of commonality were.” He added, “A good interviewer is an interviewer who has done his homework.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/stephen-kim-1513811441.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stephen Kim, a former State Department expert on North Korea, leaves federal court in Washington, Wednesday, April 2, 2014, after a federal judge sentenced him to 13 months in prison for passing classified information to a journalist.

In 2015, I wrote about the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/02/18/destroyed-by-the-espionage-act/\">interrogation and imprisonment of Stephen Kim</a>, a State Department official who was accused of talking about a classified report on North Korea with a journalist from Fox News. Kim told me that the FBI agents were friendly when they arrived at his State Department office. In his job as a North Korea analyst, he had lots of contact with intelligence and law enforcement officials, so the visit wasn’t unusual. “It wasn’t like suddenly they came in and, boom, laid it on me,” Kim explained. “They did not say, ‘We are investigating a leak.’ They did not say, ‘We are investigating you.’ … I didn’t know why they were there.”</p>\n<p>Kim had met and talked with James Rosen, the Fox reporter, but he lied to the FBI agents when they finally got around to asking about it. The agents did not indicate they knew of the contacts, so Kim thought he could get away with a fib — why draw attention to what he thought was an everyday infraction that the agents didn’t appear to be aware of? It was a mistake. Kim would later be charged not only with a violation of the Espionage Act, but also with lying to the FBI. The lawyer Kim hired once he realized he was in trouble, Abbe Lowell, was distressingly familiar with the FBI’s tactics of using noncustodial interrogations to get people to say things that no lawyer would let them say.</p>\n<p>“He was asked questions that were, for all intents and purposes, a setup,” Lowell told me for the 2015 story. “The government already knew that Stephen had had a conversation with the media. They already knew that he had had access to the information that they believed to have been classified. They were basically setting him up.”</p>\n<p>Lowell, a high-profile attorney in Washington who now represents Jared Kushner, mentioned an old adage about criminal defense attorneys. “Many of them have a fish that they mount on the wall,” he said. “These lawyers put a plaque under the fish, and in words or effect that plaque will say, ‘If I hadn’t opened my mouth, I wouldn’t be hanging here today.’”</p>\n<p>When I mentioned this to German, the former FBI agent, he told me about the “five words” motto he learned when he worked cases against neo-Nazis. Members of the neo-Nazi movement were instructed by their leaders to only say five words to law enforcement: “I have nothing to say.” They rarely followed the instruction, however.</p>\n<p>“They all had plenty to say,” German said. “I think it’s just human nature to feel like you can talk your way out of it or minimize your conduct in a way that can help you. What any lawyer will tell you is, ‘No you can’t. There’s nothing positive you can do for yourself in that interaction, and in fact, that’s why you need to get legal representation before talking with law enforcement.’”</p>\n<p>It might seem there is no harm done when FBI agents persuade or cajole people to confess to crimes. But there is a long record of law enforcement officers coaxing false confessions out of people. A <a href=\"http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7186&context=jclc\">study</a> of exonerations in the United States between 1989 and 2004 found that 15 percent of the people who were exonerated had confessed to crimes they did not actually commit. And there is an equally long and disreputable record of the government incarcerating people for a far longer time than their confessions would justify.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/fbi-interrogation-1513811579.jpg\"><img alt=\"UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 7: Seats are reserved for FBI staff in the House Judiciary Committee before the hearing on oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017.

In the Obama era, the Department of Justice issued a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4335405-DOJ-Memo-on-Custodial-Recording.html\"> new policy</a> that required agents to record custodial interrogations, and transcripts of them have been introduced as evidence, but the guidelines do not cover noncustodial questioning. The combination of recording one and releasing the transcript, as was done in the Winner case, is extremely unusual, according to the FBI agents I talked with.</p>\n<p>The transcript of Winner’s interrogation reveals the hot-cold nature of these conversations. After the relationship-enhancing questions about her workout routine, the agents got around to her job as an NSA contractor in Augusta. They asked whether she would access a document she didn’t need to access for her job. She said she wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>“OK,” Agent Garrick said. “Reality, what if I said that I have the information to suggest that you did print out stuff that was outside of that scope?”</p>\n<p>“OK,” Winner replied. “I would have to try to remember.”</p>\n<p>“Reality,” the other FBI agent said, “you know, we obviously know a lot more than what we’re telling you at this point. And I think you know a lot more than what you’re telling us at this point. I don’t want you to go down the wrong road. I think you need to stop and think about what you’re saying and what you’re doing. You know, I think it’s an opportunity to maybe tell the truth. Because telling a lie to an FBI agent is not going to be the right thing.”</p>\n<p>Winner then said she had printed a document, but put it in her office’s “burn bag,” where classified material is placed to be securely destroyed.</p>\n<p>“OK,” Garrick replied. “What if I tell you that that document, folded in half, made its way outside of NSA? It made its way out in an envelope, postmarked Augusta, Georgia. See, things are starting to get a little specific.”</p>\n<p>Winner was cornered, literally. The agents were interrogating her in a small room at the back of her house and were blocking the exit, according to a statement Winner made to the court in late August (the government claims the exit was not blocked). She did not feel free to leave the room or stop the interrogation. The scenario — of being apparently trapped — is familiar to Kim, who eventually pleaded guilty and served 11 months in prison. Kim told me that he was disoriented during his interrogations. He had never been the target of an investigation and didn’t know what to do — he didn’t realize, for instance, that he should stop the questioning and ask for a lawyer. His experience, and Winner’s, demonstrate how a coercive environment can be created without handcuffs or prison bars.</p>\n<p>“It was surreal,” Kim told me. “What are you supposed to feel? You don’t feel anything. You’re dumbfounded. Have you ever been hit really hard, like playing sports, or you ran into a pole, or somebody hit you? At first you don’t know what hit you. You’re kind of stunned. … I didn’t know what was happening.”</p>\n<p>Winner, in her <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/09/01/reality-winner-declaration/\">August 29 statement</a>, was even more direct.</p>\n<p>“During the entirety of my encounter with law enforcement on June 3, 2017,” she stated, “I was never told I was free to leave and, in fact, given the circumstances, I never felt free to terminate the interrogation or leave my home.”</p>\n<div data-linking=\"documentcloud\" data-permalink=\"https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document&amp;p=163630\"></div>\n\n<p>The transcript shows the agents, as they coaxed Winner into purportedly confessing a crime, suggesting that the matter wasn’t all that serious.  “I don’t think you make it a habit,” Garrick told her, referring to leaking documents. “You just messed up.” Taylor downplayed it further. “What we both think is that maybe you made a mistake,” he said. “Maybe you weren’t thinking for a minute. Maybe you got angry. … If that’s the case, then that makes us feel a little better, knowing that we don’t have a real serious problem here.”</p>\n<p>As the government’s filings in the case make clear, however, they are contending that Winner knew she could <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4335135-Government-Response-to-Detention-Motion-for.html\">cause</a> “exceptionally grave damage” to national security by leaking the classified document. Winner’s lawyers <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4335131-Reality-Winner-Defense-Brief-on-Classification.html\">have noted</a> that the government’s contention is dubious because so much of what is classified is actually innocuous and should not be classified in the first place; it appears the government is cynically exaggerating the potential impact of Winner’s alleged crime, to make an example out of her and intimidate other would-be leakers. Once Winner was arrested, the government even argued against her being released on bail, because she might flee the country and spill more secrets. “The defendant has shown an aptitude for deception and concealment, and she has the capacity to cause further harm to U.S. national security if released,” the prosecution argued, so far successfully.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what the FBI told Winner, she was facing an enormous amount of trouble. The irony and unfairness is that FBI agents are not prosecuted for making false or misleading statements to the unaware citizens they interrogate.</p>\n<p>Top photo: FBI agents in 1995.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: The Intercept’s parent company, First Look Media, has </em><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/\"><em>taken steps</em></a><em> to provide independent support to Winner’s legal defense through the Press Freedom Defense Fund.

        "content": "<p><span><u>When Lawrence Mishel</u> came to Washington during the height of the Reagan revolution, the options for a young leftist economist looking to make a difference were nearly non-existent. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The liberal position was represented by the Brookings Institution,” Mishel told The Intercept, “which at the time was very free trade </span><i><span>uber alles</span></i><span>, hostile to industrial policy, not interested in workers and unions. The debate was between Brookings on the left, and [the American Enterprise Institute] and the Heritage Foundation on the right.”</span></p>\n<p><span>And then there was the Economic Policy Institute, a new think tank designed to fill the ideological gap and shift America’s economic debate to the left. In 1987, Mishel joined EPI as a research director, later becoming vice president and eventually president in 2002. As his thirtieth year at EPI winds down, Mishel gets to see the Democratic Party finally move closer to the positions the think tank has always had. Now, he is </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/press/lawrence-mishel-to-step-down-as-epi-president/\"><span>stepping aside</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>“The hallmark has been to center that an economy is only working if it’s working for the benefit of the vast majority,” Mishel said. “We hammered that every day.”</p>\n<p><span>Mishel, who will stay on as a senior economist, hands off EPI this week to new leader </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/press/thea-lee-to-be-the-next-president-of-the-economic-policy-institute/\"><span>Thea Lee</span></a><span>, who came over from the labor union AFL-CIO. Both Lee and her new vice president, John Schmitt, got their start as economists at EPI, along with such stars of the progressive economic firmament as Dean Baker, Heather Boushey, and Jared Bernstein. The roster of alumni shows how Mishel and EPI built a home for the left to navigate Washington amid Blue Dogs, New Democrats, and Third Way centrists, ultimately outlasting them all.</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">From the beginning, EPI elevated the daily struggle of those on the economy’s margins.</blockquote>\n<p><span>EPI was a joint project of the labor movement and a half-dozen prominent liberal economists, including </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/people/jeff-faux/\"><span>Jeff Faux</span></a><span>, who became the organization’s first president and set its direction. Faux committed EPI to serious research — to this day the organization has more Ph.D. economists on staff than its counterparts on the center or left. But his ambition went beyond filling a shelf with white papers; he wanted EPI to wedge its way into the national conversation, to capture the attention of policymakers. “When I started as research director and suggested a project, Jeff would ask, ‘What is the headline?’” Mishel recalled. </span></p>\n<p><span>From the beginning, EPI elevated the daily struggle of those on the economy’s margins. Starting in 1988, Mishel and colleagues produced a biennial report, </span><a href=\"http://stateofworkingamerica.org/\"><span>The State of Working America</span></a><span>, with comprehensive data on wages, incomes, jobs, and wealth. The reports found a discordant trend in the economy: </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/\"><span>wage stagnation amid increasing productivity</span></a><span>. Prior to the late 1970s, these two measures followed one another: as workers produced more goods, they made more money. When that changed, others made excuses for this bifurcation while EPI insisted that conscious policy choices shortchanged workers and funneled the gains to the very top, as evidenced by </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/ceo-vs-worker-pay/\"><span>rising CEO compensation</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/testimony-raise-americas-pay/\"><span>erosion of living wages</span></a><span>. In other words, EPI argued, natural forces didn’t lead workers to their plight — those in power pushed them there.</span></p>\n<p><span>If these themes of rising income inequality sound familiar today, they were practically a foreign concept at the outset. In 1994, Mishel and Jared Bernstein </span><a href=\"http://s3.epi.org/files/2012/ib330-figureA.png.538\"><span>created a now-famous chart</span></a><span> showing the split between productivity and the median hourly wage. The researchers briefed Robert Rubin, then director of President Bill Clinton’s National Economic Council. Rubin’s proposal for increasing wages was reducing the deficit. He explained to Mishel and Bernstein how this would reduce interest rates and boost productivity, and that wages would naturally follow. Then the economists showed Rubin the chart. “We pulled out the chart. It showed that wages and productivity were not aligned,” Mishel recalled. “Rubin looked at it and said, ‘I didn’t know that.’”</span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Productivity-pay-gap-1514402197-e1514402225750.png\"><img alt=\"Productivity-pay-gap-1514402197\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Productivity-pay-gap-1514402197-e1514402225750-1024x545.png\" class=\"wp-image-164212\"></a>\n<p>Productivity growth and hourly compensation growth, 1948–2016.

But Mishel and EPI inhabited that space for decades before the center-left caught up. Mishel’s often-lonely voice constantly stressed the need to improve living standards for the typical worker, in plain English rather than with jargon or frippery. “I do think our work has been necessary to validate the lived experience of working class that has been denied by the establishment,” Mishel said, “The economy is not broken, it’s just not working for everyone. The vast majority doesn’t do well if labor incomes don’t do well.”</span></p>\n<p><span>This advocacy to redistribute power downward swims against a flood of corporate lobbyists and campaign donations, competing for policymakers’ attention. Occasionally it reaches the target. Mishel believes the 2009 stimulus helped dig the United States out of the recession, but that another large round was necessary. He split with other center-left think tanks as they followed President Barack Obama with his too-soon pivot to deficit reduction. Throughout the recession, Mishel and EPI </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/press/the-u-s-economy-would-still-benefit-from-fiscal-stimulus/\"><span>consistently demonstrated</span></a><span> that more government interventions, like direct public hiring, could improve people’s lives. “I’m proud of that,” he said.</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">As Mishel steps aside, he believes America needs a broad set of policies to rebuild worker power.</blockquote>\n<p><span>Much of EPI’s work under Mishel served to reject pernicious myths about the economy, hardened into perceived wisdom by self-interested forces. EPI’s research found that </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/the-racial-achievement-gap-segregated-schools-and-segregated-neighborhoods-a-constitutional-insult/\"><span>social and economic disadvantage</span></a><span>, not failing teachers or schools, depressed student achievement. It </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/book_grad_rates/\"><span>refuted</span></a><span> that high school graduation rates were collapsing, an alternative fact used to push vouchers or charter schools.

The work prompted the Commerce Department, under Reagan, to revise its measurements of manufacturing output. Today the hollowing out of U.S. factory jobs is an old story.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Trump era represents a dark age for labor economists, given the </span><a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/trump-nlrb-showers-big-business-gifts-workers-coal\"><span>recent assault</span></a><span> on worker protections. The dubious claim that lowering corporate taxes will translate into rising wages is at odds with Mishel’s life’s work. “We’re putting more money into corporate coffers when at this moment they’re filled with cash, earning nearly the highest after-tax profits in 70 years,” Mishel said. “This violates the history of four decades. We’ve consistently lowered taxes on capital income and the rich. Trump says we live in economic carnage, and we’re doing more of it!”</span></p>\n<p><span>As Mishel steps aside, he believes America needs a broad set of policies to rebuild worker power, things like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, empowering union organizing, ending worker misclassification in the “gig economy” to deny benefits and overtime pay, preventing arbitration agreements that limit worker options in a dispute, and banning non-compete clauses that stop workers from moving to similarly situated employers. These moves to strengthen worker bargaining power, collectively and individually, cut a path to robust wage growth for the 99 percent. “It will take bold proposals,” Mishel said. “If not, we won’t have a vibrant middle class, or a democracy.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Mishel’s mission in 30 years at EPI was not only to identify the economy’s problems, but to demonstrate how to fix it. And he consistently brought complex insights down to a level of popular understanding, striving to reach the ordinary worker rather than the academy. The way he talked about the economy mirrored who he fought for. A garrulous man with a shock of white hair, Mishel cherishes that EPI has become a fixture in Washington, and that the poles of the economic debate have finally trended in his direction.</span></p>\n<p>“I’m EPI 2.0, Jeff Faux was 1.0,” Mishel said. “I think version 3.0 is going to be great. It’s terrific that the organization remains vibrant and evolving.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Larry Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, is interviewed in his Washington office on May 31, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/28/lawrence-mishel-leftist-economist-steps-aside/\">A Leftist Economist Steps Aside As the Debate Shifts His Way</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Há 350 milhões de anos</u>, a dezenas de milhares de metros de profundidade, longe dos olhos de qualquer ser vivo, ocorreu um evento sísmico de grande magnitude. Abaixo da superfície, depois que o magma esfriou, formaram-se enormes camadas de granito, estendendo-se por até 15km em todas as direções. Em um certo lugar, contudo, a lava irrompeu pela superfície e formou uma montanha peculiar no meio de uma planície monótona.</p>\n<p>Essa estrutura hoje é conhecida como Stone Mountain (“Montanha de Pedra”, em português).</p>\n<p>Só para se ter uma ideia, Stone Mountain já tinha 343 milhões de anos de idade antes de  qualquer coisa minimamente parecida com um ser humano aparecer na superfície do planeta. Depois disso, durante os cerca de 6.999.900 anos de existência do homem na Terra, a Stone Mountain permaneceu intocada, na área atualmente conhecida como Região Metropolitana de Atlanta, nos Estados Unidos.</p>\n<p>Então, em 1915, aquela velha montanha de 349 milhões de anos se tornou o berço da Ku Klux Klan (KKK). As montanhas, é claro, não podem ser racistas. Elas são apartidárias, não enxergam raça ou religião, não são xenófobas ou homofóbicas. Depois de um longo período de existência – cinquenta vezes mais longo do que a presença do ser humano no mundo –, alguns homens brancos inseguros, no sul dos EUA, transformaram o que era uma maravilha da natureza em uma aberração.</p>\n<p>O grande responsável por isso foi Sam Venable. Esse racista de longa data comprou Stone Mountain – o que por si só já é absurdo – em 1887. Venable e sua família já haviam adquirido pedreiras em todo o estado da Geórgia, e agora pretendiam explorar Stone Mountain. Mas os irmãos Venable não atuavam apenas no negócio de pedras, mas também no da intolerância. Os dois tiveram um papel central na expansão inicial da KKK, e chegaram a conceder a essa violenta organização supremacista branca <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/7/14/1402185/-When-the-world-s-largest-monument-to-the-Confederacy-is-now-in-a-town-with-75-African-Americans\">o direito de usar suas terras</a> para sediar encontros locais, regionais e nacionais.</p>\n<p><em>Idolatria</em> (tradução livre de <em>Graven Image</em>, título original do filme), um brilhante curta-metragem de Sierra Pettengill – produzido pela Fields of Vision –, conta a história da profanação de Stone Mountain. Com impactantes imagens de arquivo, o filme narra as origens de um monumento confederado esculpido na face da montanha. Trata-se de um relato moderno: embora algumas passagens não tenham som, o monumento de Stone Mountain é uma ideia recente o suficiente para que sua história fosse toda registrada em película. A inauguração da escultura foi transmitida ao vivo e a cores, como mostra o filme de Pettengill.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Com impactantes imagens de arquivo, “Idolatria” narra as origens de um monumento confederado esculpido na face da montanha.</blockquote>\n<p>Em 1916, um ano após a KKK realizar o ritual da queima da cruz em Stone Mountain e  anunciar seu renascimento, a ideia de desfigurar a montanha com uma escultura  gigantesca dos heróis da Confederação começou a ganhar força. É de conhecimento geral o papel de tantos homens terríveis na criação e na manutenção do racismo sistêmico nos EUA; mas a atuação vergonhosa de muitas mulheres brancas permanece relativamente desconhecida. Em <em>Idolatria</em>, porém, o protagonismo das mulheres no esforço para transformar a montanha em um monumento ao racismo não é ignorado. Pettengill mostra imagens de arquivo de mulheres brancas, em seus vestidos rendados, bordando uma bandeira confederada.</p>\n<p>Foi Caroline Helen Jemison Plane, presidente da sucursal de Atlanta da United Daughters of the Confederacy (“Filhas Unidas da Confederação”, UDC), que convenceu os donos da propriedade a conceder à organização acesso à montanha. Ao criar a Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association, a ideia original de Plane era que os líderes da KKK fossem imortalizados ao lado dos generais confederados.</p>\n<p>De 1916 até o auge dos movimentos pelos direitos civis, nos anos 1960, os trabalhos prosseguiram de maneira intermitente, sempre com o apoio da UDC. Mas uma coisa permaneceu constante: a montanha nunca deixou de ser usada como ponto de encontro de racistas.</p>\n<p><u>Antigamente,</u> todo negro da Geórgia sabia que não devia entrar naquele lugar. Foi o que descobri em primeira mão em 1998, quando ainda estudava no Morehouse College – uma universidade para jovens negros fundada em outra colina georgiana em 1867. Em uma aula de História Afro-Americana com o lendário Dr. Marcellus Barksdale, ele nos aconselhou a nunca ir a Stone Mountain. Com uma seriedade que surpreendeu a todos, ele nos contou como tudo naquele lugar era não só odioso como também destinado a nos ofender e intimidar.</p>\n<p>Enquanto o Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. e o movimento pelos direitos civis conquistavam respeito e influência no país, os políticos brancos da Geórgia, cem anos depois da Guerra Civil Americana, decidiram que havia chegado novamente a hora de dedicar todos os seus esforços – e recursos públicos – para finalmente completar aquele monumento confederado. Nada mais natural. Afinal, um monumento aos líderes do exército confederado era tudo de que o sul dos EUA mais precisava nos anos 1960, certo?</p>\n<p>Contrariando o conselho do meu professor, visitei Stone Mountain várias vezes. A escultura e o parque de diversões construído ao redor dela eram tão ruins quanto ele descrevera. Além do mais, aquele pedaço de terra não tinha nada a ver com a Guerra Civil. Ao que tudo indica, os três homens cujas imagens foram gravadas no granito – Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee e Stonewall Jackson – nunca estiveram naquele lugar.</p>\n<p>Stone Mountain não virou o maior monumento à Confederação por ter uma conexão com a história confederada, e sim porque os racistas que a compraram – e adoravam que ela fosse ponto de encontro da KKK – sabiam que nada daria tanta visibilidade à sua visão de mundo quanto aquela escultura.</p>\n<p>Em <em>Idolatria</em>, vemos o então governador racista e segregacionista da Geórgia, Marvin Griffin, anunciando, em 1958, o uso de recursos públicos para comprar a montanha e incentivar a continuação da obra. Ele sabia muito bem o que significava construir aquele monumento naquele momento histórico, mas isso não o impediu de prosseguir.</p>\n<p>Atualmente, a cidade de Stone Mountain é tão negra quanto a NBA, a liga de basquete dos Estados Unidos. A Região Metropolitana de Atlanta, o lar de algumas das melhores “universidades historicamente negras” do mundo, é vista por muitos como a Meca dos negros americanos. Apesar disso, lá está aquela escultura, homenageando homens que lutaram com unhas e dentes para preservar a escravidão nos EUA.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Stone Mountain é um monumento que não tem vergonha, mas sim orgulho de sua história.</blockquote>\n<p>Hoje em dia, Stone Mountain é um monumento que não tem vergonha, mas sim orgulho de sua história. Todas as noites, um estranho show de luzes projetadas na face da montanha celebra a Confederação – cena mostrada logo na abertura de <em>Idolatria</em>. O parque temático associado ao monumento promete levar o visitante a uma versão nostálgica do início do século 19, embora todos saibam que aqueles tempos não foram nada agradáveis para os negros das redondezas.</p>\n<p>A KKK continua sediando encontros em Stone Mountain até hoje, o que não é nenhuma surpresa, pois poucos lugares no país se esforçaram tanto para que eles se sentissem em casa.</p>\n<p>Stone Mountain foi uma Charlottesville antes de Charlottesville. Há muitas gerações, homens brancos inseguros vestem fantasias e andam a esmo por lá carregando tochas, tentando intimidar os outros com seus rituais ridículos. Os políticos da Geórgia continuam celebrando o doloroso passado de Stone Mountain, e sequer cogitam a possibilidade de remover o monumento e deixar aquela paisagem com a mesma cara de 349 milhões de anos atrás.</p>\n<p>Mas é isso que precisa acontecer.</p>\n<p><em>Texto de Shaun King.

They landed at several points along the broad Corrientes River, which flows south over the country’s densely forested border with Ecuador. Hundreds of indigenous Achuar men, women, and children, many carrying ceremonial spears, organized into units by clan and village. They then followed their apus, or chiefs, toward seven targets: the area’s lone paved road, a power plant, and five facilities for the pumping and processing of petroleum.</p>\n<p>The sites were occupied, their night staff escorted peacefully outside. By morning, the Achuar of the Corrientes controlled the local infrastructure of Lot 192, the country’s largest and most notorious oil block.</p>\n<p>Over the next two days, the occupations spread. On the neighboring Tigre and the Pastaza rivers, Kichwa and Quechua chiefs led takeovers of key roads, the only airstrip, and several oil batteries.</p>\n<p>“This is not a symbolic action — we have completely paralyzed the country’s most important oil field,” declared a spokesperson for several of the indigenous federations backing the protest.</p>\n<p>The takeover of Lot 192 lasted for 43 days. It was hardly the first protest to shut down the oil facilities studding the rainforests of Loreto, Peru’s biggest region and for decades the hub of its petroleum industry. Since 2006, the native people who live on the river basins where this oil is produced — a watershed of five major Amazon tributaries: the Pastaza, Tigre, Corrientes, Marañón, and Chambira — have executed at least a dozen similar uprisings. Some are just a few days; others stretch across seasons. Last autumn, indigenous communities launched a flotilla from the town of Saramurillo that blocked traffic on the Marañón River, the main artery of Lot 192’s sister block, Lot 8, for four months.</p>\n<p>These uprisings have all demanded the same redress. For nearly a half-century, the state oil company, Petroperú, and its foreign partners have wreaked systemic contamination on the region, transforming daily life and poisoning the five rivers, whose waters fuse with the Ucayali River to become the Amazon just east of Iquitos, Loreto’s capital.</p>\n<p>“For 45 years, the companies and the state have damaged our waters, soils, and health with impunity,” said Carlos Sandi, an Achuar chief in his early 30s who helped lead the recent protest on the Corrientes. “We will not allow them to continue extracting resources from our territory without a guarantee of prior consultation on the environmental and social impacts.”</p>\n<p>As demands go, the federations’ insistence on prior consultation is a modest one. Under the Peruvian constitution and international legal conventions ratified by the government in Lima, they already possess the right to prior consultation. But the indigenous people on the five rivers have always fought for basic things, beginning with rights and water. As Lima signs deals on new oil blocks throughout the Peruvian Amazon — including an expected 30-year lease to expand Lot 192 — their fight for the right to live enters its endgame.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/2-Map-Peru-Amazon-oil-1514322401.jpg\"><img alt=\"2-Map-Peru-Amazon-oil-1514322401\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/2-Map-Peru-Amazon-oil-1514322401-1024x676.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164167\"></a>\n<p>The area of the Peruvian Amazon where indigenous tribes have launched protests against oil spills.</p>\n<p>Map: The Intercept</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">A</span><u>fter striking oil</u> in Loreto in 1972, the Houston-based Occidental Petroleum, and later its successor, the shadowy Dutch-Argentinian-Chinese company Pluspetrol, proceeded to commit a series of sustained and extravagant environmental crimes. For decades, spills have gone untreated or covered with a thin layer of dirt. Ponds in floodplains have been filled with toxic waste. Corroded pipes, including the main Northern Peru Pipeline, have been neglected and let to rust out, leak, and explode into gushing spills.</p>\n<p>Then there is the generational scandal of the companies’ produced water. Until less than a decade ago, Pluspetrol, following the policy of its predecessor, Occidental, ignored the standard industry practice of re-injecting the carcinogenic fluids generated by oil wells, known as produced water. Peru’s Ministry of Environment estimates the companies dumped 1 million barrels a day directly into the rivers and forests of Lots 8 and 192. This amounts to 3 billion barrels of toxic fluid flushed into the water tables and food chains of at least 40,000 people.</p>\n<p>Pluspetrol agreed to stop dumping produced water in 2006, after Achuar and Urarina communities blockaded the Corrientes and occupied 180 of its wells, shutting down operations for two weeks.</p>\n<p>But the concession on produced water did nothing to remove the lead, arsenic, mercury, chromium, and barium found in the local streams, rivers, and lagoons used for fishing, bathing, and drinking. It did nothing to treat the birth defects, learning disabilities, liver disease, skin rashes, cancers, and chronic head and stomach pains reported by communities in the area. And it did nothing to stop the hundreds of spills and leaks that have led the Ministry of Environment to issue multiple emergency declarations in the region since 2013.</p>\n<p>The downstream impacts, though unstudied, reach deep into Brazil and the wider Amazon basin. This past August, when locals say 5,000 barrels of crude destroyed two Achuar fishing estuaries, the oil soon reached the Corrientes, which confluences with the Marañón, which joins the Ucayali to become the Amazon, the jugular artery of a watershed that contains a fifth of the world’s freshwater and performs a key function in regulating the planetary thermostat. “The impact of [oil activity] in the headwaters of the Amazon extends well beyond the boundaries of oil concessions and national borders,” states a recent paper in the journal Environmental Pollution, “[and] should be taken into consideration when evaluating large scale anthropogenic impacts in the Amazon.”</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-1-1514309571.jpg\"><img alt=\"LORETO, PERU – JULY, 2017: The Pastaza River in the state of Loreto, Peru on July, 2017.

Getting to Lot 192 requires commitment. Because no airlines service the tiny airport — the companies maintain a private fleet — the best route involves a six-seater to the dirt airstrip at San Lorenzo, a southern Loreto frontier town, followed by two days on the Pastaza River, a journey requiring a skilled native boatsman and several barrels of fuel.\n<p>This summer, I made this trip and spent several days in the oil town and surrounding communities of Andoas, a former Quechua trading village near Peru’s northern border with Ecuador. It was here, surrounded by jungle stretching hundreds of miles in every direction, that Occidental built its headquarters in 1971. At the time, it was a risky bet to try and pump oil from Loreto’s clay loams and transport it to Pacific ports across a vast tropical rainforest floodplain, where the rainy season lasts six months and parks a 10-foot tide, complicating transport, construction, and maintenance.</p>\n<p>The village of Andoas, with its several thousand inhabitants, feels like a metropolis after days passing riverside wilderness on the Pastaza. Electrified homes extend outward from a central plaza lined with supply stores and cafes and bars built with concrete floors. People pass each other without greeting. Oil workers from around Peru provide what passes for diversity. On the dirt paths leading to nearby villages, colored lights advertise curtain-door brothels.</p>\n<p>“Oil has made Andoas a hell,” Aurelio Chino Dahua, a Quechua chief, told me not long after my arrival. “Occidental changed the Quechua way of life. There is no peace in this place. Noise, bars, prostitution. People are sick.”</p>\n<p>I met Dahua at a community assembly he was directing as president of FEDIQUEP, the Quechua Peoples Indigenous Federation of the Pastaza River. Several hundred Quechua had traveled to Andoas by canoe, in some cases for days, to meet in a large school building in Nuevo Porvenir, a neighboring village. At the front of the hall, the diminutive Dahua directed proceedings in beaded headdress and face paint, moderating debates and presenting slideshows on the past, present, and future of Lot 192. Above the stage hung a banner displaying a photo of two tapirs, the region’s largest jungle game, drinking from a pool of produced waters. The audience sat in wooden straight-back chairs and passed gourds of fermented yucca juice, buckets of which lined the back wall.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-2-1514309619.jpg\"><img alt=\"Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-2-1514309619\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-2-1514309619.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-164116\"></a>\n<p>Indigenous peoples from five river basins united in Saramuro-Saramurillo, Marañón River in October, 2016.</p>\n<p>Photo: Sophie Pinchetti/The Chaikuni Institute</p></div>\n<p>In March 2008, two years after the protest over Pluspetrol’s dumping of produced water, Dahua helped lead a protest against Pluspetrol’s plans for the drilling of new wells (and its ongoing illegal dumping of produced water). He was at the runway blockade when national police from a division known as Special Operations stormed the airport. The resulting clashes left one Quechua villager and one police officer dead. Fifty protesters were arrested and imprisoned for weeks in Iquitos; some reported beatings and torture while in the custody of national police.</p>\n<p>During a break in the assembly, I sat down with Dahua in a white-walled classroom and asked him about growing up with oil on the Pastaza River.</p>\n<p>“In the 1970s, when I moved from my small village to attend secondary school in Andoas, I saw oil for the first time,” he said. “It was in the river and lakes. I saw dead fish, turtles with oil on their shells. It was hard to hunt. Everything was expensive. The indigenous communities started to think of themselves as ‘poor.’”</p>\n<p>When Pluspetrol announced plans for a new round of seismic testing in 2006, Dahua argued for a new kind of resistance.</p>\n<p>“I told my brothers, ‘Look at the reality. It’s a disaster. We must stop the expansion.’ I was nominated president and we joined the other federations to make the big strike in 2008. It was a violent conflict that ended when the state and the company made promises they did not keep.”</p>\n<p>Not all Quechua support Dahua, and community opinion is divided on strategy and goals. Some locals see Dahua as a threat to the jobs and small gifts the oil company provides, which they say are needed because pollution has made traditional ways of life impossible.</p>\n<p>“We can no longer rely on our forests and rivers for food, so we have become dependent on the industry that created this hell,” said Dahua. “This is the same industry that made us ashamed of our culture. The oil workers call us ‘nativo’ and ‘indigena’ in a derogatory way. It was the same with the caucho period [the rubber boom]. My family was treated like savages to make rubber. Oil is a new kind of slavery. They give us rules, take the resources, and leave contamination.”</p>\n<p>When tribespeople talk of the rubber boom, it is not an archaic reference. It lives close by in the collective memory. The rubber trade of the Upper Amazon was a brutal, slave labor economy that lasted well into the 20th century. It wiped out and traumatized indigenous populations across the region, particularly in Loreto’s northeast, near the borders with Colombia and Brazil. Just as the atrocities of the Second World War inspired the human rights conventions chartered at the United Nations, the horrors of the caucho era shamed the world into its first formal recognition of indigenous rights worldwide. The Forced Labor Convention, adopted in 1930 by the International Labor Organization, centered on the legacy of slavery in the Amazon. It took another six decades for the ILO, a specialized U.N. agency, to adopt the landmark 169 Convention recognizing the cultural and territorial rights of indigenous peoples. Multiple U.N. Special Rapporteurs have concluded that the oil industry overseen by the Peruvian government, which ratified ILO 169 in 1994, has routinely violated the treaty.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-4-1514309624.jpg\"><img alt=\"NUEVO PORVENIR, LORETO, PERU – JULY 9, 2017:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rosa Nashmate Bapahuiri, age 34, with her son Erudito, age 4: “When I was a young girl in the 1980s, you could still find good, healthy fish near my village, Lobo Yacu.

There he lives today with his wife, Rosa, and their youngest son, Erudito, a toddler. One evening at sundown, I sat with them by a stream. As Erudito played in the water, Rosa talked about how oil has changed life in Loboyaku and a thousand other villages like it.</p>\n<p>She says, “When I was a young girl in the 1980s, I remember the shock of visiting Andoas and seeing children scavenge garbage outside the Occidental building. But in Loboyaku, you could still find healthy fish. Now, you have to travel hours in a peke-peke” — a motored canoe — “to find healthy fish. And the soil is not the same. Every rainy season, when the water rises, the land is contaminated. Yucca, plantains, tomatoes — they are dry, dark, and boney. My parents talk about the days when they’d farm so many fruits, they would waste them. Now, we have a lack of fruits.”</p>\n<p>When I ask about oil’s health impacts, Rosa lowers her eyes. To talk about this subject is difficult. The state has conducted little research on the decline of human health on Loreto’s five rivers, leaving only suggestive data — 98 percent of Achuar children tested positive for high levels of lead and cadmium in a study published in 2007 — and the recurring themes of indigenous testimony. I press Rosa on what she sees and hears when she travels the region with her husband.</p>\n<p>“The impacts are most serious for the children,” she says. “There are a lot of deformations and development problems. The young are underdeveloped and skinny. Quechua used to live until they were quite old. Now, some pass away very young. Some are too weak to get out of bed. There are new diseases. When someone looks sad and pale, a little yellow, no appetite, a big belly — that is the end stage of cirrhosis. You can send them to Iquitos. But it’s too late. You can only wait for them to die.”</p>\n<p>When asked about life before and after oil, elders in the region often begin here, with the “new illnesses.” Many of the conditions plaguing the five rivers were, until recently, extremely rare or unknown. At the assembly, I met a wrinkled Achuar woman named Ines Arahuandza who recalled the traditional medicine of the pre-oil era, which ended for her in the early 1970s when Occidental explosives teams arrived in the woods behind her riverside village of Titiyaku.</p>\n<p>She says, “When I was a child, there were no doctors. The shaman treated us after taking ayahuasca” — a ritual hallucinogenic healing tea — “with the patient. We only used medicines from the forest. Now, there are new sicknesses. My whole family is sick from the contamination. I’m worried about my grandchildren. The company must repair the pipes and pay us for the disasters. If I get reparations, I can feed my family and buy medicine to recover our health. Where can I bring my children when they are sick? To the shaman? The shaman cannot heal them.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/IMG_3700-1514312803.jpg\"><img alt=\"Feb 3rd 2017 in San Pedro, a village right on the Marañon.

That sub-block, called 8x, is located inside the northern part of the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, described by the late Peruvian ecologist Antonio Brack Egg as “one of the most important areas for the reproduction of hydro-biological species in the Amazon.”</p>\n<p>In the years since Petroperu transferred operation of 8x to Pluspetrol in 1996, a series of major spills and pipeline ruptures has poisoned the fishing grounds and drinking water of tens of thousands of local indigenous people. Three of these events have resulted in official declarations of health and environmental emergency.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, in Lima, I met an influential Kukama chief from the Marañón, Alfonso López Tejade, after one of the biggest pipeline ruptures. We were sitting in the Indigenous People’s Pavilion built for side events during the U.N.’s 2014 climate summit, when I asked what he thought of the morning’s panel discussion.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-two children in Kukama villages are vomiting blood right now after drinking water contaminated by oil,” Tejade said. “We’re sitting here eating nice food with diplomats and my brothers are dying. We come here full of pain. We have no faith in the government or these international talks.”</p>\n<p>This exchange was on my mind in the village of San Pedro this July, where I witnessed the impacts of another pipeline break on the Marañón, not far from Tejade’s village.</p>\n<p>My guide in the spill zone, a 28-year-old Kukama fisher named Elmer Castillos, departed the village in his motored canoe at sunrise. We headed to an inland estuary, known as a cocha, which until recently had served as the primary fishing grounds for a dozen local villages. Located a few miles into the forest, the cocha is reachable by boat from the Marañón through a lush landscape of streams, swamps, mangroves, and lily-padded lagoons.</p>\n<p>But we arrived at the entry stream to find the water unusually low, even for dry season. Castillos grabbed his machete and, with hardly a break in his stride, spent the next two hours hacking a path through the forest. When we paused to rest midway, he described what oil had done to the fish of the Marañón.</p>\n<p>“Their livers are sick, their insides often discolored and gray,” he said. “Sometimes the meat is tasteless, sometimes you can taste the oil. Sometimes the gills are full of oil. To find healthy fish, we travel far into the forest. It’s not like living in the city. Nature is our supermarket. The pipelines are breaking and leaking all the time. When we report the spills, the government and the company blame us for sabotaging the pipes.”</p>\n<p>As the day grew hot, the forest opened at last into the cool and high-canopied cocha. Sun-dappled and still, the banks of the waterway spread into grassy clearings like little parks. A lovely spot that hinted of paradise. Then I looked down. The water was a swirl of brown and black, marbled with the greasy rainbows of petroleum in water. Everywhere floated dead and dying fish; I counted a dozen without trying.</p>\n<p>“Petroperú has already collected two tons of dead fish,” said Castillos. “More are dying every day, especially armored catfish. They float to the surface, too sick to swim.”</p>\n<p>Entering the lagoon, we came upon a camp of workers hired by Petroperú to repair the pipe and remove the oil. Some were local Kukama who’d grown up fishing these waters and were now skimming oil for collection in enormous yellow canvas tanks. The workers gave us fresh filtered water to drink and lent us a canoe. As we floated through the spill, Castillos pulled more dead fish from the water.</p>\n<p>“I have four children,” he said. “I want them to be educated and healthy. My nephew just tested positive for high levels of lead. I know how it happened. We were ignorant for a long time. But now I can tell you about the chemical composition of oil. Toxicity. How the poison gets into our blood. Now we know too much.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-5-1514314131.jpg\"><img alt=\"DOS DE MAYO, PERU – JULY 16, 2017: Apu Alfonso Lopez Tejare, pilots a boat from Naulta to his home village of Dos de Mayo on the Marañón River in the State of Loreto, Puru.

A black stain covered the river all the way to Nauta, several hours by boat. The company hired us to collect the oil with sticks and mugs and bury it. They gave us no protection. Weeks later, flood season arrived. Our communities and farmlands were flooded with petroleum. The people dug holes and tried to bury it.Even then, we didn’t know much about oil. We didn’t understand when the media said it would take the heavy metals 30 years to settle in the bottom of the river. But we noticed the fish in the streams were becoming thin and malnourished. Their eggs were small. Before the spill, we would drop a net and catch half-a-ton of fish. After, we caught maybe 30 kilograms of sick fish. People began to be ill. Strange bumps and rashes. Children no longer learned well in school. They had stomachaches and headaches. The traditional medicines did not cure us.

For everyone involved, it was a familiar ritual. As a young Quechua resident of Andoas explained it, “When the protest goes more than one week, they send someone to quiet us with promises. The high-level people always say, ‘Andoas is in our hearts.’ But we’re in their hearts only when we stop the oil. When nothing changes, there is more conflict.”</p>\n<p>Lima’s recent promises include a basket of treaties signed after last year’s four-month blockade of the Marañón River at Saramurillo. Forced to the negotiating table, the government and Pluspetrol agreed on paper to a number of longstanding federation demands: an independent audit of pipelines, remediation for spills, a review of Pluspetrol’s contract, a regional Truth Commission, compensation for impacted communities, and an end to the criminalization of protest.</p>\n<p>These have yet to be fulfilled, and indigenous faith that the assurances will be honored, by the government or the oil company, is low.</p>\n<p>Representatives from Peru’s Ministry of Culture, a key player in the consultation process, Peru’s Office of Sustainability and Dialogue, the main government go-between with the indigenous federations, and the Ministry of Environment either declined or did not respond to interview requests. Porter Novella Peru, the PR agency handling Pluspetrol’s Peru operations, requested The Intercept send questions by email, but did not respond to them.</p>\n<p>Because so many promises have proven empty over the decades, a deeper questioning of oil and extractive industry has begun to animate Loreto’s indigenous politics. Despite the growth of the oil industry, Loreto remains one of the country’s poorest regions, with many of its traditional hunting and fishing grounds pushed to the brink of permanent ruin. Now some indigenous leaders are growing more radical, looking beyond demands for remediation and consultation.</p>\n<p>“The viability of oil is now being questioned,” said José Fachin Ruiz, a member of the Kichwa federation FECONAT, who was jailed for months following the bloody 2008 protest in Andoas and currently faces criminal charges related to his role in last year’s action on the Marañón River. “During last year’s blockade at Saramurillo, the indigenous peoples of Loreto began to unify behind a post-oil vision of development.”</p>\n<p><div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Oil-Pollution-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon-6-1514315817.jpg\"><img alt=\"DOS DE MAYO, PERU – JULY 17, 2017: A mural in the Kakuma village of Dos de Mayo, in the State of Loreto, Puru on July 17, 2017.

A map of every oil and mining project in the nine Amazon countries would reveal a dense continental grid of new concessions and related infrastructure, from a proposed “Mining Arc” in Venezuela, to highways through Bolivian nature and indigenous reserves.\n<p>These projects fit into a long-term regional infrastructure and development program, led by Brazil, known as IIRSA, or the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America. The idea is to facilitate the expansion of industry on the continent, including the Amazon, by building an interlocking network of dams, rail lines, power stations, airstrips, and roads in remote and formerly unreachable rainforest. “No attempt has been made to assess the cumulative impacts of this massive scheme,” according to a report from International Rivers, an NGO. “As a result of IIRSA, illegal logging along new roads and waterways will also impact extensive areas of the Amazon, affecting indigenous and other traditional communities. The communities that lie in harm’s way have not yet been informed about the planned projects, nor have they been asked what they think of these plans.”</p>\n<p>The indigenous peoples of the region, too, have begun to think in terms of supranational coordination. Federations from the five rivers work with others from around the continent through the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, or COICA. The organization, based in Lima, declared September 22 a Day of Action for the Amazon and its peoples, with events held throughout the Americas.</p>\n<p>The clash between these visions and agendas — embodied by IIRSA and COICA — has grown beyond fights for remediation, consultation, and justice in isolated patches of rainforest. It is increasingly a clash of worldviews that holds everything in the balance. At least, this is the view of Loreto’s indigenous leaders.</p>\n<p>“The Western culture looks at the forest and sees money, resources to sell,” Aurelio Dahua, the Quechua chief, told me in Andoas.</p>\n<p>“The government and company officials are very professional and have studied in the cities. They think they are going to teach us poor nativos how to live. But what kind of knowledge lets you destroy the lungs of the world? Why don’t they find another way to develop this country? Why not help us protect the forest? They know nothing. They are building their own graveyard.”</p>\n<p><em>María Guadalupe De Heredia contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>Top photo: A dead fish floats in a film of oil residue of a recent pipeline leak in San Pedro, on the Marañón River in the state of Loreto, Peru on July 19, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/27/peru-amazon-oil-pollution-indigenous-protest/\">“This Is Not A Symbolic Action” — Indigenous Protesters Occupy Oil Platforms in Radicalized Fight Against Pollution in the Amazon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Maggie Wynne’s career</u> as a foot-soldier in the anti-abortion movement began in Congress, where throughout much of the 1990s she was a staffer for the so-called Pro-Life Caucus. When George W. Bush took the White House, she moved to the Department of Health and Human Services to work in the office that connected Congress and the agency.</p>\n<p><span>A few years later, in 2005, she became a special assistant within HHS. But as the administration neared its end, Wynne pulled off a bureaucratic move known as “burrowing,” in which an appointed official becomes a career government employee, with all the job protections that entails.</span></p>\n<p><span>So when Barack Obama’s HHS team arrived, Wynne was there waiting for them at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, continuing to wage her bureaucratic battles on behalf of the unborn. Career staff are famously difficult to fire, but they can be marginalized so that they can’t stall an agenda. In 2011, HHS got her out of the agency temporarily</span><a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/hhs-announcement-made-mrs-plan-help-trafficking-victims-tough-sell\"><span> by </span><span>“detailing” her to the staff </span></a><span>of the House Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights Subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., the most zealous right-to-lifer in the House and co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus. The reassignment was part of an effort to keep her away from the bidding process for federal funding for anti-trafficking work, as Wynne was known to favor the U.S. bishops who fought a new Obama-era requirement to offer victims access to abortion services. </span></p>\n<p><span>She managed to involve herself in the process regardless, and, in 2015, Wynne’s department was reorganized to strip most of her authority; she was left directing a relatively small trafficking office, helping to determine whether foreign-born victims qualified for public services. Less than a year later, with the punditry convinced Hillary Clinton would become the next president, Wynne finally called it quits. For the next several months, she went to work for the Knights of Columbus and was the pilgrimage director at the </span><a href=\"https://www.jp2shrine.org/en/index.html\"><span>St. John Paul II National Shrine </span></a><span>in Washington.</span></p>\n<p>But then Donald Trump won.</p>\n<p><span>Wynne quickly came back to public service, becoming an early and influential member of the HHS transition team. A woman who’d just recently been a low-level functionary within the agency now had influence over staffing it at the highest levels, and, until the new director arrived, </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-trump-officials-making-abortion-an-issue-at-the-uss-refugee-office\"><span>she was effectively running</span></a><span> ORR. She got herself named Counselor for Human Services Policy, one of the most powerful positions within the department.</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">The lurch toward the evangelical, right-to-life movement has elevated what were once sleepy bureaucratic backwaters into prominent culture war battlefields.</blockquote>\n<p>“The Counselor is the point person for the secretary and the agency on all major policy and program decisions,” explained Jeff Hild, who served under Obama as chief of staff for HHS’s Administration for Children &amp; Families. “It’s a crucial position, and pretty under-the-radar as it’s not public-facing. But the people who have held that job are some of the most experienced and respected in the field of human services. During the Obama administration, the Counselors had decades of experience prior to taking on the role, including as senior staff in Congress and leaders at prominent think tanks.”</p>\n<p><span>Wynne is none of that. But she does have one critical qualification: She is zealously opposed to abortion — and a slew of her allies in the movement soon poured into the building. </span></p>\n<p><span>Wynne, in many ways, is the story of the Trump administration: a fringe operative who fought her battles far from the center of power, suddenly washed into a position of extraordinary authority. Across the administration, officials like her have been leaving their marks, but in the Health and Human Services Department, the lurch toward the evangelical, right-to-life movement has elevated what were once sleepy bureaucratic backwaters into prominent culture war battlefields. </span></p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/scott-lloyd-protest-1514308317.jpg\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 26: Activists carry boxes of petitions calling for Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Trump administration to reverse their position of interfering in women's access to reproductive health care, before the start of a House Judiciary Committee hearing concerning the oversight of the U.S. refugee admissions program, on Capitol Hill, October 26, 2017 in Washington, DC.

He formerly worked as an attorney for Knights of Columbus, a leading anti-abortion group, and once </span><a href=\"https://ethikapolitika.org/2011/04/04/facts-on-abortion-why-you-cant-be-pro-life-and-pro-contraception/\"><span>argued</span></a><span> that “contraceptives are the cause of abortion.” Wynne, who spent seven years toiling in ORR, overlapped with Lloyd at Knights of Columbus before coming back to join Trump’s transition team. </span></p>\n<p><span>It was the Office of Refugee Resettlement that made international news by attempting to block a 17-year-old immigrant in its custody from getting an abortion. In late October, after being barred for a month by Lloyd, the unaccompanied minor — known in court filings as Jane Doe — was finally able to end her unwanted pregnancy. She was detained in a privately run shelter funded by ORR – which had implemented a new policy forbidding shelters from “facilitating” abortions. Except Jane Doe wasn’t relying on the shelter to pay for the procedure, or even to transport her there. She just needed permission to leave temporarily.</span></p>\n<p><span>In court filings, the administration wrote that it has “strong and constitutionally legitimate interests in promoting childbirth, in refusing to facilitate abortion, and in not providing incentives for pregnant minors to illegal cross the border to obtain elective abortions while in federal custody.” As Jane Doe waited for her abortion, government agencies forced her to obtain counseling from a Christian-affiliated crisis pregnancy center and to look at an ultrasound.</span></p>\n<p><span>The American Civil Liberties Union ultimately prevailed in court for Jane Doe, but the underlying ORR policy remains in place, and in mid-December the ACLU</span><a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4330096/12-15-17-Jane-Roe-TRO-Motion.pdf\"> <span>filed suit</span></a><span> on behalf of two more undocumented minors – Jane Roe and Jane Poe. A federal judge ruled in their favor </span><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-abortion-migrant-20171218-story.html\"><span>last week</span></a><span>. In court filings </span><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334732-document-22014499.html\"><span>several days later</span></a><span>, Lloyd argued that ORR shouldn’t let even a minor impregnated through rape end her unwanted pregnancy because perhaps she’d experience “additional trauma” as a result. </span></p>\n<p><span>Brigitte Amiri, an ACLU attorney representing the minors, told The Intercept that ORR started to interfere with abortion access in March by working aggressively to dissuade teenagers, giving them unwanted religious counseling, and even contacting their parents against their express wishes. “When all that fails, as it did with Jane Doe, then they just say you can’t get an abortion,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"> <span>“They just flout the law and the Constitution. They’re utterly, utterly brazen.” — Brigitte Amiri, ACLU</span>\n<p><span>These problems, Amiri emphasized, didn’t all start with Trump. “Under Obama, millions of dollars flowed to shelters that had objections to abortion, and if the minor asked for one, they could say well you can’t stay here but we’ll contact the federal government and they’ll transfer you somewhere else,” Amiri said. “It was totally stigmatizing, it delayed access to abortion, and it made the procedure more risky. I had meetings with ORR’s directors – Eskinder Negash in the early years and Bob Carey towards the end – and I said you need to overhaul these policies. But they would not budge, so</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/aclu-northern-california-v-burwell\"> <span>we sued them</span></a><span>.”</span></p>\n<p>This is, in many ways, the defining contrast between the last administration and the current one. The Obama administration, sometimes to its credit, other times to its great discredit, tried to walk a fraught middle ground. In the case of HHS, it meant partnering with faith-based groups in ways that sometimes made accessing reproductive health care more difficult for youth and victims. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has abandoned all pretense of compromise.</p>\n<p><span>“They just flout the law and the Constitution,” said Amiri. “They’re utterly, utterly brazen.” </span></p>\n<p>Under the Obama administration<span>, former ORR director Robert Carey said, the office had a deliberate process for crafting policy that involved convening stakeholders, drafting revisions, and providing opportunities for feedback. That process had been inherited from the Bush administration, and every administration before it, since the advent of the modern bureaucracy. Under Trump, new ORR policies — including the rule banning grantees from “facilitating” abortion — have been issued through hastily drafted emails and memos. </span></p>\n<p><span>The new rules are issued with such speed that nobody, apparently, even reviews them for grammar. According to court filings, on March 30, two days after becoming ORR director, Lloyd emailed his team announcing that ORR-funded shelters “should not be supporting abortion services pre or post-release. Only pregnancy services and life-affirming options counseling.” Another email dated March 4 and sent by then ORR-Acting Director Kenneth Tota said that if unaccompanied minors “may be involved in an abortion” then ORR-funded shelters were “prohibited from taking any action that facilitates an abortion without direction and approval from the Director of ORR.” </span></p>\n<p><span>When she first learned the federal government was prohibiting Jane Doe from leaving her shelter to access an abortion, Amiri, the ACLU lawyer, thought, “No way, they can’t do that.” But then, she told The Intercept, “I realized, oh, they can do it, and they will do it, until a court stops them.”</span></p>\n<p><u>Aside from appointments</u>, many advocates <span>have raised concerns with specific actions HHS has taken over the past year – actions signaling that vulnerable populations, including undocumented immigrants, victims of trafficking, and LGBTQ individuals – may be subject to further discrimination. Indeed, “vulnerable” is one of the Centers for Disease Control’s newly banned words.</span></p>\n<p><span>When the HHS published its </span><a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/strategic-plan/index.html\"><span>draft strategic plan</span></a><span> for FY2018-2022 this past fall, it removed all mentions of LGBTQ individuals and ethnic minorities that had appeared in the Obama-era version.

Rather than worry if the level of protection offered to minors was adequate, the groups charged that ORR had fallen short of “protecting existing and prospective grantees, contractors, subgrantees and subcontractors with religious or moral objections.” Specifically, they protested requirements to offer victims access to emergency contraception and abortion, even through referrals.</span></p>\n<p><span>Put differently, two years ago, some faith-based groups called on the federal government to exempt them from providing victims with comprehensive reproductive services. Today, the government itself is led by officials like Wynne and Lloyd who </span><i><span>forbid grantees</span></i><span> from providing youth with comprehensive reproductive services, even when those grantees have no</span> <span>religious or moral objection to doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span>As the Supreme Court currently reviews</span><a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/masterpiece-cakeshop-ltd-v-colorado-civil-rights-commn/\"> <span>a case</span></a><span> that could make it easier for states, businesses, and organizations to discriminate based on religious or moral objections, the stakes for LGBTQ individuals are particularly high.</span><span><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span>Earlier this year when HHS released its annual national survey on older adults, it announced it would no longer be asking questions</span><a href=\"https://www.sageusa.org/newsevents/news.cfm?ID=453\"> <span>about gender identity</span></a><span> — effectively preventing transgender adults from identifying as a subgroup on the questionnaire.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We know the history of HIV and AIDS, we know what happens when the government is not willing to name a group of people who are most affected by a public health issue,” said Harper Jean Tobin, the director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality. “For years we have been trying to document and address the serious health disparities transgender people face, and we can’t do that when the government refuses to name them as a population.”</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“It’s really important to us that HHS send a signal to the states that federally funded agencies need to serve all youth.”– Julie Kruse, Family Equality Council</blockquote>\n<p><span>On December 15, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published</span><a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and-family/marriage/promotion-and-defense-of-marriage/created-male-and-female.cfm\"> <span>an open letter</span></a><span> rejecting the legitimacy of transgender identities. “We come together to join our voices on a more fundamental precept of our shared existence, namely, that human beings are male or female and that the socio-cultural reality of gender cannot be separated from one’s sex as male or female,” the letter reads.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not to be outdone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is under the authority of HHS, made global news itself that day with reports that it had developed </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?utm_term=.a7ac40ed55d5\"><span>a new list of verboten words</span></a><span>. Along with “vulnerable,” words such as “evidence-based,” “transgender” and “fetus” no longer exist, as far as the agency is concerned. </span></p>\n<p><span>What the department does or does not do influences others across the country. “It’s really important to us that HHS send a signal to the states that federally funded agencies need to serve all youth,” said Kruse of the Family Equality Council. According to the group’s data, 19 percent of foster youth over the age of 12 identify as LGBTQ, and same-sex couples foster at four times the rate and adopt at six times the rate of opposite-sex couples. Despite 111,000 foster children waiting to be adopted annually, and an opioid epidemic that has exploded that population,</span><a href=\"https://everychilddeservesa.family/\"> <span>seven states</span></a><span> have passed bills that allow adoption and foster care agencies to discriminate against LGBTQ youth and prospective parents. Three of those bills passed in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We’re very concerned about placement of LGBTQ youth into non-affirming homes or into faith-based group homes where they might be subjected to conversion therapy,” said Kruse.</span></p>\n<p><span>And it’s not just youth. HHS currently requires all medical facilities receiving Medicaid and Medicare to honor the visitation preferences of their patients, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. HHS may soon decide to allow federally-funded hospitals and health clinics to turn away LGBT patients or their loved ones. “State and local housing agencies that administer programs, like housing vouchers or loans to assist with purchasing a home, could [also] refuse to offer those services to LGBT older adults and older same-sex couples,” warned a </span><a href=\"http://www.lgbtmap.org/file/Older-Adults-Religious-Exemptions.pdf\"><span>new report</span></a><span> from the Movement Advancement Project. </span></p>\n<p><span>A Manhattan playboy, who campaigned as friendly to the LGBTQ community and has <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sba-list-abortion_us_5731f3dfe4b0bc9cb0480225\">dubbed himself “very pro-choice,”</a> is now leading the most extreme anti-choice, transphobic, and anti-gay administration in modern history.

        "content": "<p><u>On Zerious Meadows’s</u> last day in prison, he woke up at 4 a.m., as usual, because his cell mate works in the kitchen and leaves early to prepare breakfast. He listened to the radio — a station that plays R&amp;B and rap from “the time when it had meaning” — and then went about distributing the last of the items he’d accumulated in 47 years behind bars.</p>\n<p>Meadows, 63, gave his television to an 18-year-old who had just arrived at Macomb Correctional Facility, in New Haven, Michigan, and his radio to one of the older inmates. Someone asked why he didn’t sell the radio — it’s a large, solid one, unlike the ones the prison sells now, and he could have gotten as much as $200. Meadows had no use now for what passes as prison currency: “I didn’t want to be paid in potato chips or whatever other commissary items,” he said.</p>\n<p>He gave away his dark blue prison uniforms, jackets, sweatshirts, and T-shirts, but kept the underwear he’d recently purchased, to wear under the clothes his sister Pamela had bought him.</p>\n<p>And then he waited.</p>\n<p>When I met with Meadows on the night of November 13, just hours before his scheduled release, he seemed at once calm and nervous. He would not look at me directly, beyond a passing glance, and instead often looked at his impeccably shined black shoes. He hadn’t eaten all day, and his head hurt — “probably from the stress,” he said. He listed all the things he planned to do the next day — see his family, including the many nieces, nephews, and their children, some of whom he had never met. His mother was going to cook one of his favorite things — a turkey leg — and he just wanted to have some time alone with her. But he didn’t want to dream too hard, in case it didn’t happen, because this was the second time he’d been promised his freedom.</p>\n<p>“When I go home, I just want to sit on the floor up against the couch next to my mother,” he said. “But I won’t believe it’s happening until I walk out those doors.”</p>\n<p>Meadows was never supposed to get out of prison. In 1971, he was sentenced to life without parole, charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail into a house on Lemay Street, about a mile west of the Detroit River, and setting it on fire. Two children died in the fire, 12-year-old Ruth Taylor and her 4-year-old sister, Regina. Meadows was just 16 when he was arrested and 17 when he was sentenced.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">The United States is the only country that sentences minors to life in prison without parole.</blockquote>\n<p>The United States in the only country that sentences minors to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/03/the-u-s-is-the-only-country-that-routinely-sentences-children-to-life-in-prison-without-parole/\">life in prison without parole</a>. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles were unconstitutional. In January 2016, the Supreme Court tackled the case of retroactivity, ruling in favor of Henry Montgomery, who was sentenced to life for a crime he committed in 1963, when he was 17, and allowing the approximately 1,500 people who were sentenced before 2012 a chance at release.</p>\n<p>Michigan has the second-highest number of juvenile lifers in the country. There were about 360 people eligible for re-sentencing in January 2016 and so far, 35 have been released.</p>\n<p>Though they’re given classes — taught to use a debit card and a cellphone; write a resume, fill out paperwork to get birth certificates, and Social Security cards — for those like Meadows who have spent decades in prison, life on the outside is often daunting.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Macomb-Correctional-Facility-1513991450.jpg\"><img alt=\"ADVANCE FOR MONDAY SEPT. 12 AND THEREAFTER - Inmates at the Macomb Correctional Facility work with assigned leader dog Harley in New Haven, Mich, on Aug. 17, 2016.

Shortly before Montgomery, he told me: “You kind of like opened the wounds and made me think about certain stuff that I kind of had suppressed. … I really suppressed missing my childhood.”\n<p>Meadows is the second of nine children. The family is tight-knit — Meadows’s sister Pamela Davenport said their father used to jokingly ask their mother where all these children had come from and said there were so many of them that they didn’t need any friends, because they had each other. Their father, Zerious Sr., worked at the Detroit Public Dock &amp; Terminal and in the city sanitation department; the mother, Ann, was a stay-at-home mom.</p>\n<p>Davenport was 9 when Meadows was sentenced. Her parents let all eight children skip school to be in court that day, October 6, 1971 — their wedding anniversary — and to this day, the image that is stuck in her mind is of her father falling to his knees after the judge said that Meadows would spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>\n<p>“He just kept saying, ‘No, not my son!’ Everybody was crying. We was all trying to hold on to [my father],” Davenport, now 55, said. “It was the first time I saw my father cry.”</p>\n<p>Meadows told me he was calm as he was led out of the courtroom. He has always maintained his innocence. He had an alibi and says the people who testified against him lied. He assumed they would eventually tell the truth, and he’d be released.</p>\n<p>“It was like in a daze, but it was like something said, just don’t worry,” Meadows told me. “I don’t know if it was because of my age or what because, I hate to admit this, but at the time I didn’t think grown-ups lied.”</p>\n<p>A year later, it seemed Meadows would get his chance at being released, when his case was overturned due to an issue with one of the witnesses. Meadows was re-tried and offered a plea deal, which he refused, and was again sentenced to life without parole.</p>\n<p>“They’re saying that I killed two people when I didn’t,” he said. “I’d rather die saying I wasn’t guilty of this thing, than admit it just to get out.”</p>\n<p>Meadows spent his first 10 years at the Michigan Reformatory in Ionia, which was then mainly for men under 21. He played sports, studied welding, worked on car and boat motors, and in the machine shop. He also got his GED and is four credits short of an associate’s degree in business accounting. He says his credits didn’t transfer over when he moved from one prison to another in the 1980s, and he just gave up.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">“My life story,” Meadows said. “I’m kind of used to disappointments.”</blockquote>\n<p>In 47 years behind bars, Meadows has only received four tickets for misconduct, and he got them early on, mainly for fighting. The older men looked out for him and kept him from getting in any trouble beyond that. “I was real wild and just incorrigible to a sense. If you said something I would, like, say something smart, and instead of them hurting me, they’d talk to me.”</p>\n<p>Meadows was also sustained by family visits. He has been in six different prisons, but even when he was a three- to four-hour drive from home, they still made the trip. Meadows has a stack of over 200 Polaroids documenting these family gatherings, many from the 80s, when he could wear his own clothes. He’s decked out in Adidas T-shirts and acid-wash jeans, posing with family and friends in front of backdrops of palm trees and tropical sunsets. The photos span decades, chronicling the changes in his siblings’ lives on the outside, with later pictures including what Meadows would never have — spouses, and then children.</p>\n<p>While the visits boosted Meadows, he often became depressed watching his family leave, to the point where sometimes he would tell them he did not want to see them at all. “It’s just like you’re lashing out at somebody that cares for you because you ain’t got nothing else,” he said.</p>\n<p>The family would come anyway. Meadows’s father died of cancer in November 1992, and Meadows’s siblings recount how in the hours before his death, he had made them promise to continue visiting their brother. Meadows’s family had not told Meadows his father was ill, though he’d asked on several occasions why his father hadn’t come to visit. He knew something was wrong when his mother, sister, and niece arrived at the prison. “They just had that look on their faces and you could just … I knew it wasn’t a good thing because when they told me to go in the room I just, you knew something wasn’t right.”</p>\n<p>While his father’s death was painful, Meadows said simply: “It’s something I dealt with.”</p>\n<p>Meadows also lost a brother, Kenneth, who was murdered in November 1979. Meadows said that even then, so much had gone wrong in his life that he was not surprised. A lot of other men were also losing brothers and other relatives on the streets. “I grieved, I got mad, I asked, ‘Why him?’ he said. “But I also had the attitude where I accepted that certain stuff just happened.”</p>\n<p>Still, Meadows felt frustrated when his family had health and other issues — Davenport had an aneurism, and his mother has had a number of strokes — and he couldn’t help.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Meadows created a routine to keep his mind occupied and away from painful thoughts, and developed a kind of stoicism. Though there were moments he hoped he’d go to bed and not wake up, he found ways to exist and he always, though there was no tangible reason for hope, believed that one day he would be released.</p>\n<p>His family is religious, but it isn’t faith that gave Meadows hope. He wonders if there is a God, why that God would have allowed him to spend a lifetime behind bars for a crime he did not commit.</p>\n<p>He started running in 2005 — he describes it as a moving meditation — and generally stuck to himself, reading, watching his television, and listening to the radio.</p>\n<p>As a Level II prisoner, Meadows had certain privileges — an open cell block, where he could come and go as he pleased, and a job as a porter, where he earned about $60 a month. He was told he could move to Level I, but refused, because it is where people who are soon to be released are housed, and he said he did not think he could handle people leaving while he had to remain behind.</p>\n<p>But then, in late 2015, Meadows heard about the Montgomery case, and the possibility of being re-sentenced. He had a panic attack. He was scared of being free, because he’d seen several other men who had served decades wither once they were released, unable to handle the sharp mental shift from prison. Meadows told me at the time: “It’s just like when you read about a person who’d been in prison, got out, and just snapped, you know, killed the dog, the cat. I understand and I hope that don’t happen to me, but people got to realize when you’re locked up, sometimes you suppress so much stuff.”</p>\n<p>By June 2016, when Meadows went before the parole board, he’d become more comfortable with the idea of being released. His family would support him, as they always had. He would live with Davenport and she would help him find work.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Kym-Worthy-Zerious-Meadows-1513978379.jpg\"><img alt=\"Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy looks at documents in Detroit on Monday, April 20, 2015.

Worthy was the prosecutor who appealed Meadows’ case.</p>\n<p>Photo: Paul Sancya/AP</p></div><br>\n<u>When Meadows went</u> to court on September 23, 2016, as in 1971, the entire family was there, about 20 people. When the judge announced that Meadows’s new sentence was 25 to 45 years, with time served, and that he would be released that night, they cheered and hugged. But then when Davenport and her husband went to get Meadows from the jail that evening, they were crestfallen to find that he wasn’t there.\n<p>Unbeknownst to Meadows and his family, the county prosecutor had filed an emergency motion arguing that under the Michigan statute for re-sentencing, Meadows should have been given a sentence with a maximum of 60 years. This does not mean that those re-sentenced have to serve 60 years, simply that the sentence given must read “25-60 years.”</p>\n<p>Meadows found out at about 8:30 that night, when no one had come to get him, that something had gone wrong. When his lawyer, Melvin Houston, explained that he was not going to be released and that though he was going to appeal, there was no telling what would happen, Meadows was discouraged but somewhat resigned.</p>\n<p>“My life story,” Meadows said. “I’m kind of used to disappointments.”</p>\n<p>Houston argued that the prosecutor was trying to keep Meadows incarcerated as long as possible, in keeping with what was happening with other cases. In Michigan, county prosecutors have pushed to upload the life sentences in about 65 percent of cases. In Oakland County, while prosecutor Jessica Cooper filed 44 cases for re-sentencing in July, she said her office would ask for a stay in every single case to maintain the life sentences. This, in essence, goes against the Supreme Court ruling in Montgomery, because the end result is that very few people are actually being given a chance at release.</p>\n<p>The decision to keep Meadows behind bars was confusing and demoralizing for his family. Davenport, who had often been the first one in the car when her father had driven to see Meadows, said she continued to visit, but it suddenly felt more tedious. “I just hated going up there, but I had to,” she said. “I got tired of leaving him there. I just wanted to take him with me.”</p>\n<p>Davenport got that chance about a year later. Meadows was sent to the parole board again in August 2017. He maintained his innocence — something he worried would mean he’d be kept behind bars, because parole boards generally want to hear an admission of guilt and statement of remorse — and was given a release date.</p>\n<p>At around 10 on the morning of November 14, Meadows walked out of the Macomb Correctional Facility with his sister Regina and her daughter Ebony, along with Davenport, her husband, Dee Wayne, and her grandson. They stopped at a Starbucks on their way to the parole office and ran into another sister, Cynthia, who just happened to be driving along the same road. They spent about two hours at the parole office, waiting to see his officer, and in that time Meadows was greeted by other men he’d met over almost five decades in prison.</p>\n<p>Meadows’s parole officer explained the conditions of release — he has to report to the office twice a month, can only sleep at his sisters’ and mother’s house, and needs to pay a $600 monitoring fee. Then the family drove to Davenport’s house.</p>\n<p>Relatives trickled in throughout the afternoon. While most congregated in the dining room, looking at Meadows’s collection of photographs, laughing at their younger selves, Meadows often sat in the living room, where it was quieter. His 17-year-old great nephew explained the difference between Androids and iPhones — “iPhones are better, because they have this thing called FaceTime,” he explained, and Meadows’s months-old great-niece sat beside him in her car seat, and delighted in playing with his nose.</p>\n<p>Meadows’s mother had a doctor’s appointment and was one of the last to arrive. The two embraced and then sat on the sofa in a state of disbelief. Ann Meadows said there really weren’t words to describe how she was feeling. “This is like a dream. It was a prayer answered,” she said.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">In the weeks since his release, he has struggled with some of the things most take for granted — using a cellphone and a debit card.</blockquote>\n<p>While Meadows did not say anything that night, he later told me it was overwhelming being around so many people: “I wanted to be by myself. All of a sudden, it felt like I was being squeezed in a box.”</p>\n<p>He still often retreats to his bedroom in the basement of Davenport’s house, where he now lives. In the weeks since his release, he has struggled with some of the things most take for granted — using a cellphone and a debit card. He has also enjoyed the mundane — raking leaves and having neighbors wave as they drive by — and has been looking for work. He will do just about anything, preferably something using his hands, because that’s all he feels he knows how to do.</p>\n<p>“I want to see if I can support myself. I’m so used to people doing for me,” he said.</p>\n<p>When I interviewed Meadows when he was still incarcerated, he could not recount any particularly traumatic moments he’d had in prison. Now, he said, memories of other men being murdered and raped, and female corrections officers being physically and otherwise abused by male officers have all come flooding back.</p>\n<p>“I see how veterans come back from war, they be having them flashbacks. That’s what happened to me,” Meadows said. “I guess when I was in, my body put me in survival mode.”</p>\n<p>Each day, he tries to stay out of his room a little longer. He spends most days with his siblings and finally got to sit on the floor beside his mother as he’d dreamed, explaining that when he was little, he liked to sit on the floor and play with his mother’s toes.</p>\n<p>While he was in prison, Meadows would not talk much about what he’d lost in the decades behind bars — the chance to have a career, marry, have children and grandchildren. Now, all the desires he’d curbed have flooded his mind so fast, he doesn’t quite know where to start.</p>\n<p>“I lost my teens, 20s, 30s … There’s no saying what I could have accomplished,” he said. “I got locked up so long, and now it’s like I’m starting all over from 16.”</p>\n<p><em>Lisa Armstrong is a Fund for Investigative Journalism/Schuster Institute Social Justice Investigative Reporting Fellow.</em></p>\n<p>Top photo: Zerious Meadows, his sister Regina and two nephews waiting to see his parole officer, in Detroit, MI, a few hours after he was released on November 14, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/26/zerious-meadows-minors-life-without-parole/\">Zerious Meadows Was Sentenced to Life Without Parole at 17.

        "content": "<p><span><u>Ana (nome fictício) é</u> mulher, negra e trabalhadora rural da região norte do Centro-Oeste do país. Ela começou a trabalhar aos 7 anos, quando pegou no cabo da enxada pela primeira vez para ajudar a sua família na lavoura, nas terras que seus pais arrendavam, para garantir o alimento e uma renda mínima para viver. </span></p>\n<p>Anos mais tarde, na adolescência, “aprendeu na prática a ser cozinheira profissional”, ofício que exerceu por anos nas casas da elite da capital do estado em que ainda mora e que não revelaremos, assim como a atual idade de Ana, por questões de segurança. Nessa altura da vida, ela já não estudava mais, seu último ano na escola foi a 5ª série do ensino fundamental. Na juventude, cozinhou até mesmo em “casa de artista”, lembra.</p>\n<p>Já adulta, trabalhou como catadora. Era do lixo que vinha a sua renda mensal de 250 reais. Foi graças ao serviço de gente como Ana que a cidade ganhou um aterro sanitário. Mas, como aprendeu com a sua família, o sustento não vem apenas de um lugar. E, como muitos pobres da zona rural, Ana passou a buscar seu ganha-pão de cidade em cidade.</p>\n<p>Foi em uma dessas viagens, no início deste ano, enquanto vendia  maçãs do amor em uma feira, que ela conheceu uma mulher que se apresentou como Sandra e lhe ofereceu um emprego de faxineira em um hotel, na Europa.</p>\n<p>Logo depois, Ana recebeu cinco ligações de homens que ela desconhecia. Mas a responsável pelo esquema no Brasil era mesmo Sandra.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Eu perguntei como seria isso, quais eram as condições. Ela me disse que ‘seria’ 1.500 euros por mês, com cama e comida. Eu falei: “Então eu vou!” Ela disse que pagava a passagem. Meu passaporte ficou pronto no dia 6 [de março] e no dia 7 minha passagem já tava comprada”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>O trajeto foi Centro-Oeste – São Paulo – Amsterdã – Lisboa. A motivação foi o sonho de dar um futuro melhor aos seus três filhos e ao neto que ficou sob sua guarda depois que o filho mais velho foi assassinado por conta de uma dívida com traficantes, há três anos.</p>\n<p>Ana conta que, mesmo não tendo “um centavo na carteira”, não teve problema algum ao desembarcar  em Lisboa, na madrugada do dia 8 de março. De lá, ela foi levada para uma região mais afastada da capital, que ela não sabe dizer onde é.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Tinha um cara me esperando. Eu entrei em um carro, eles pediram meu passaporte para fazer um contrato de trabalho. Lá no carro eu fui andando, depois peguei um trem e depois outro carro. Eu cheguei numa casa com um portão muito chique. Fui recebida por uma senhora loira. A gente subiu, dormiu. No outro dia, eles mandaram a gente descer, aí eu fui descobrir que ali tinha prostituição”.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>Naquele momento, ela também descobriu que possuía uma dívida de 8 mil euros, referente à passagem de avião e à emissão do passaporte, retido pelos criminosos.</span> <span>Além disso, teria que pagar um valor diário se quisesse comer e trocar suas roupas de cama.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“A gente tinha que pagar 50 euros todos os dias. Olhei aquele tanto de segurança com cachorro. Eu sem passaporte e nem nada, tinha que pagar! Davam três horas [da tarde] a gente descia só de calcinha, sutiã e salto alto, e parava só 6h da manhã”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ana conta que, além da prostituição, a casa também lucra com tráfico de drogas. Segundo ela, a cocaína atrai muitos clientes que alugam quartos e ficam trancados, por um ou dois dias, com mulheres, obrigando-as a usar também.</p>\n<p>“Tinha menina que ficava fechada no quarto com o cliente. Quando saía, a gente só via sangue escorrendo. Ela não comia e nem bebia”.</p>\n<p>No fim, mesmo se o cliente tivesse pago pela droga, o mesmo valor era acrescentado à dívida das mulheres que haviam usado a cocaína.</p>\n<h3><b>A casa</b></h3>\n<p>Ana se lembra que o lugar era um sobrado com portão cinza. Conta que, da janela do quarto, dava pra ver um pomar de mexerica e laranja. Em outros cantos da casa, era possível ver uma piscina, sauna, jardim e um imenso pátio, que todas eram privadas de usar – a não ser se fosse com clientes. No andar de cima, havia oito quartos, onde elas dormiam e atendiam clientes que buscavam apenas um serviço de poucas horas. Nos fundos, havia outros dormitórios especiais, alugados para estadias de mais de um dia.</p>\n<p>Uma mulher chamada “Lili” coordenava a casa. Ela falava inglês, português e espanhol, e tinha o cuidado de acomodar as mulheres de maneira que as nacionalidades fossem diferentes, a fim de evitar qualquer tipo de conversa entre elas.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Ela era muito arrogante, muito bruta. A gente não podia conversar muito. Eu morava com uma colega no quarto. Ela era africana. A gente nunca ficava conversando, porque a gente não se entendia. Eles faziam isso de propósito pra não ter conversa. A gente só conversava chorando”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ana afirma que, na casa, tinha mais duas brasileiras, de 16 e 17 anos. Pelo sotaque, pareciam ser cariocas. Além delas, se lembra de venezuelanas, paraguaias e marroquinas. Era o dono do local que traçava o dia a dia de cada uma delas.</p>\n<blockquote><p> “Eles cortavam os nossos cabelos. Botavam peruca loira, vermelha, para os clientes acharem que era diferente. Eles falavam: vocês têm que dar é o dinheiro, suas putas. Se não trabalhar, vocês não comem!”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Os nomes também eram mudados. Ana foi chamada de Xica da Silva, Mônica e Pilar. Ela conta que o tempo parecia não passar, e a angústia só aumentava juntamente com a sua dívida.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Tinha noite que eu fazia até dez programas. Você faz 100 euros, 200 euros, e fica devendo 50. Você nunca sai de lá. É um massacre pra alma. Mais eu me escondia, mais eles olhavam pra mim. Diziam: ‘Ah, eu quero é aquela lá, aquela Tristeza que tá lá no fundo’”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Elas eram obrigadas a fazer tudo que o cliente pedia. Era o dono que dizia até onde elas podiam ir ou não. E assim, eram expostas a todo tipo de violência.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span>“Você tinha que transar com camisinha, sem camisinha. Quase perdi todos os meus dentes. A gente tinha que deixar os homens gozar na nossa boca, porque se não deixava, apanhava. Meus dentes </span><i><span>tão</span></i><span> todos marcados. O que eu posso fazer? Eu tenho mágoa, tenho rancor. Nós era[mos] igual cachorro!”.</span></p></blockquote>\n<h3><b>Liberdade</b></h3>\n<p>Após dois meses em Lisboa, Ana foi transferida para outra cidade portuguesa. A mudança aconteceu tarde da noite, o que limitou sua lembrança sobre o trajeto.  No cativeiro, o desejo pela morte era unânime. “Não havia vida ali”.</p>\n<p>O que impedia ela e outras mulheres de tentar suicídio, por vezes, era a lembrança da família. E foi lá que, consumida pela tristeza, ela adoeceu.</p>\n<p>“Eu deitei, rezei e pedi pra Deus me ajudar. No outro dia, eu acordei com a pele toda coçando, toda marcada. Minha pele ficou igual à escama de peixe. Ficou toda machucada e sangrava”.</p>\n<p>De início, trocaram o sabonete. Os traficantes disseram a ela que era “doença de rua”, contraída de algum homem. Sem melhoras e com os clientes reclamando das condições da mulher, trancaram Ana em um porão sob a vigilância de um cachorro.</p>\n<p><span>Com a piora da doença, ela foi transferida novamente. Desta vez, para um apartamento num lugar que Ana suspeita ser a ilha de Formentera, próxima a Ibiza, nas Baleares espanholas.</span></p>\n<p>Sua pele já estava coberta de feridas, a ponto de não conseguir mais andar. Com isso, os criminosos decidiram que a solução seria abandoná-la em frente ao consulado brasileiro, em Barcelona.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span>“Entregaram meus documentos para um homem [que trabalhava para a máfia]. Compraram uma passagem de barco, para dez e meia da noite. Ele me disse que era pra eu olhar só pra baixo. Pensei: agora o moço do barco vai ver que o meu visto </span><i><span>tá</span></i><span> vencido e eu vou falar o que está acontecendo, mas ele não olhou”.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Chegando ao porto, devolveram seus documentos e pagaram um taxista que a levou ao consulado.</p>\n<h3><b>Salvação</b></h3>\n<p><span>No dia 1 de agosto, direcionada pelo consulado, Ana foi acolhida pelo programa</span><a href=\"http://www.adoratrius.cat/\"> <span>SICAR cat, que é ligado à entidade católica Adoratrices</span></a><span>, em Barcelona, e tem como prioridade atender mulheres vítimas do tráfico de pessoas.</span></p>\n<p>Embora estivesse livre fisicamente, emocionalmente ela estava “destruída”. Seus primeiros dias na “casa das freiras” eram de muita aflição. Lembrava-se das companheiras que ficaram para trás, das violências que havia sofrido e de tudo o que foi obrigada a fazer. Não confiava em ninguém.  Ela conta que se tremia toda vez que tinha que sair na rua.</p>\n<p>Ana descobriu que as feridas em seu corpo eram derivadas de uma doença de pele conhecida como psoríase, que causa lesões avermelhadas e descamativas. A doença se tornou crônica porque também reage ao nível de estresse a que a pessoa está exposta.</p>\n<p><span>Segundo relatório feito pelo projeto SICAR cat, a melhora de Ana só foi possível após o contato com a sua irmã. O sorriso tímido no rosto surgiu pela primeira vez, depois de meses, quando, devido uma interlocução do projeto com a base espanhola da </span><a href=\"https://www.caritas.es/index.aspx\"><span>Cáritas</span></a><span>, organização humanitária que atua em defesa dos Direitos Humanos, ela descobriu que a sua passagem de volta ao Brasil havia sido comprada.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Repressão ao crime</b></h3>\n<p>Atualmente, o caso de Ana está sendo investigado pela Unidade de Repressão ao Tráfico de Pessoas da Polícia Federal (URTP), que recebeu a denúncia do consulado brasileiro em Barcelona. A Divisão atualmente é comandada pela delegada Janaína Gadêlha, que informou que já tem feito os encaminhamentos necessários na expectativa de solucionar o caso.</p>\n<p><span>Segundo dados do Sistema Nacional de Procedimentos, gerenciado pela Corregedoria da Polícia Federal, de 2007 a 2016, foram instaurados 705 inquéritos para investigar crimes de tráfico de pessoas. Já o Sistema Nacional de Informações Criminais, dirigido pelo Instituto Nacional de Identificação da PF, aponta que, no mesmo período, foram 137 inquéritos, que indiciaram 284 pessoas. </span></p>\n<p>Questionada sobre essa divergência significativa no número de inquéritos, Gadêlha explicou que se tratam de “dois sistemas diferentes, alimentados por diversas pessoas que atuam nas pontas de investigação”. Com isso, “essas diferenças eventualmente podem surgir”, diz ela, sem dar mais detalhes.</p>\n<p><span>Em 2011, o Escritório das Nações Unidas para Drogas e Crimes (UNODC) criou o </span><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/cld/v3/htms/?lng=es\"><span>Case Law Database</span></a><span>, uma base de dados online que traz detalhes sobre a nacionalidade das vítimas e dos criminosos, as rotas do tráfico, as decisões judiciais e outras informações sobre casos no mundo inteiro. De acordo com a plataforma, o Brasil possui apenas 132 sentenças registradas.</span></p>\n<p><span>A jornalista Priscila Siqueira, autora do livro “Tráfico de Mulheres: Oferta, Demanda e Impunidade”, publicado pelo Serviço à Mulher Marginalizada, em 2004, resume as dificuldades no levantamento de dados: “Não há como fazer uma pesquisa perguntando, por exemplo, ‘quantas mulheres o senhor trafica por ano?’. O que se deduz é baseado em denúncias, boletins de ocorrência, registros de saúde, que são sempre subnotificados”.</span></p>\n<p><span>Desde março de 2004, o Brasil é signatário do </span><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/crime/marco-legal.html\"><span>Protocolo de Palermo</span></a><span>, instrumento legal das Nações Unidas que trata do tráfico de pessoas. No entanto, somente no ano passado foi criada uma </span><a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2015-2018/2016/lei/L13344.htm\"><span>legislação</span></a><span> que atue diretamente na prevenção, repressão e assistência à vítima. </span></p>\n<p><span>No início de dezembro, em um evento em Goiânia, o juiz Rinaldo Aparecido Barros, membro do Fórum Nacional do Poder Judiciário para Monitoramento e Efetividade das Demandas Relacionadas à Exploração do Trabalho em Condições Análogas à de Escravo e ao Tráfico de Pessoas (</span><a href=\"http://www.cnj.jus.br/programas-e-acoes/assuntos-fundiarios-trabalho-escravo-e-trafico-de-pessoas/fontet\"><span>FONTET</span></a><span>), afirmou que “a lei ainda caminha de forma tímida e não alcançou a adesão da população, diferente do que acontece com a lei Maria da Penha, por exemplo”. </span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">“O tráfico de pessoas aparece como um crime vantajoso em relação ao tráfico de armas e drogas, sendo mais difícil demonstrar sua materialidade, já que o ‘objeto’ do crime é a própria vítima.”</blockquote>\n<p><span>Rinaldo explica que “o tráfico de pessoas aparece como um crime vantajoso em relação ao tráfico de armas e drogas, sendo mais difícil demonstrar sua materialidade, já que o ‘objeto’ do crime é a própria vítima, que muito frequentemente se recusa a colaborar com a Justiça”, muitas vezes por medo de represálias e insegurança. Segundo o juiz, “apesar de a maioria dos países ter criminalizado legalmente as principais formas de tráfico de pessoas, a utilização dessas leis para processar e condenar os traficantes ainda é limitada”. Atualmente, a pena é a mesma de condenações por tráfico internacional de armas: 4 a 8 anos de reclusão e multa.  Bem inferior ao crime de tráfico de drogas: reclusão de 5 a 15 anos e multa a ser determinada pelo juiz, destinada ao Fundo Penitenciário Nacional.</span></p>\n<p><span>De acordo com o </span><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2017/03/quase-um-terco-do-total-de-vitimas-de-trafico-de-pessoas-no-mundo-sao-criancas-segundo-informacoes-do-relatorio-global-sobre-trafico-de-pessoas.html\"><span>Relatório Global sobre Tráfico de Pessoas 2016</span></a><span>, que coletou dados entre 2012 e 2014, a maioria das 5.800 vítimas na América do Sul é de mulheres, sendo que 45% são adultas e 29% menores de idade.

A instituição brasileira, sediada na Suíça e com uma base em Goiânia, atendeu 53 vítimas de diferentes estados do Brasil, de 2011 a 2016.

Independente disso, ele afirma:</span></p>\n<p>“Nós nos envolvemos, vamos atrás, pedimos, clamamos para as pessoas nos ajudarem.

Her asylum appeal had just been denied, and she and her four children had been issued deportation orders. They had until November 29 to turn themselves in to immigration officials. Her lawyer advised her to go back to Mexico, which she had fled in 2015 after three of her relatives were killed. But Hernández wasn’t going back: she had read on Facebook that some people facing deportation had found sanctuary in a church in Philadelphia. She just didn’t know which church, so she tried dozens.</p>\n<p>“I think all the churches’ cameras have recordings of me knocking on their doors,” Hernández told me, speaking in Spanish. “I asked for information and people would tell me, Do you know how large Philadelphia is?”</p>\n<p>With her kids in the car, Hernández kept searching all day, every day, without stopping or eating until evening. “I was no longer hungry from looking,” she said. “I wanted to find someone who would say, We are going to help you.” Eventually, someone gave her the address of a sanctuary church, but one of the numbers in the address was wrong, so she circled around trying to figure out the correct location, “like a puzzle,” she said. Finally, she reached a member of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia — a grassroots coalition fighting for justice for immigrants. By then, they had heard about a woman going around the city looking for sanctuary — but they had nowhere for her to go immediately, and more than 100 other deportation cases to deal with. “We asked her to come back the next day,” said Sheila Quintana, an organizer with the group.</p>\n<p>The following day — a day before she was supposed to turn herself in to immigration officials — Hernández showed up with her bags and children, ages 15 to 9. “I told them, If you are going to help me, help me, because I can’t go back to my house.” The people Hernández had been living with were undocumented, and she knew that if ICE went to look for her there, they would be detained as well.</p>\n<p>Organizers with the sanctuary movement started calling their member congregations — until the pastor of the Church of the Advocate, a black Episcopalian church in North Philadelphia with a long history of civil rights activism, agreed to take the family in that same night.</p>\n<p>“I thought a sanctuary was like, you find the church and knock, and go inside and then you stay,” said Hernández. “But it’s not like that. A sanctuary movement is very difficult to find.”</p>\n<p>Hernández is one of at least 32 people who have publicly taken sanctuary from deportation in churches in 14 states across the country. Those seeking and offering sanctuary in church do so hoping that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will continue to honor agency <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/ero/enforcement/sensitive-loc\">guidelines</a> that list places of worship as “sensitive locations,” where officers are not to conduct enforcement actions. So far, ICE has kept out of churches — even as agents have arrested parents outside their children’s schools and even detained a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy as she left a hospital, both “sensitive locations” under the guidelines.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for ICE told The Intercept in an email that the sensitive locations policy, which “remains in effect, provides that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should generally be avoided, and require either prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official or exigent circumstances necessitating immediate action.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/3-sanctuary-church-mexican-immigrants-ice-deportation-philadelphia-1514149303.jpg\"><img alt=\"Carmela and her family watch a Kwanzaa celebration at the church.

The church was home to the National Conference of Black Power in 1968, and the Black Panther Conference of 1970. The first ordination of women as Episcopal priests took place here in 1974. Today, the Advocate is one of the first black churches to offer sanctuary.</p>\n<p>Reverend Renee McKenzie-Hayward, the church’s pastor, said yes as soon as she got the call. “I was just responding to the human need,” she told me. “This is just in keeping with the nature and the tradition of the church of the Advocate. It’s just simply in our DNA; that’s who we are and this is what we do.”</p>\n<p>“The oppression that we face we really face as people of color,” she added. “We recognize that white supremacy is a problem for all people of color, and for all people.”</p>\n<p>“Typically, communities are siloed into fighting for themselves separately and we see this as an opportunity to reach across communities and build relationships,” said Quintana. “It’s in everybody’s best interest to be a united front right now, because everyone is under attack.”</p>\n<p>Everyone at the church has welcomed Hernández and her children. As we spoke, in a cloister behind the church’s soup kitchen, an elderly man she didn’t know walked by. “God’s gonna take care of y’all,” he told her.</p>\n<p>For now, Hernández is living in a small classroom. When I visited, her children stretched out on mismatched mattresses spread on the floor, absorbed in their phones and tablets while a soap opera played on a desktop computer. Toiletries lined a blackboard, and a few clothes were folded on the shelves of a bookcase.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/6-sanctuary-church-mexican-immigrants-ice-deportation-philadelphia-1514149877.jpg\"><img alt=\"Carmela looks on as her children eat lunch, brought to them by church staff from the food prepared for the church's daily afternoon soup kitchen.

I watched as they unwrapped a domino set someone had sent them, while the pastor of a different congregation dropped by with a puzzle, and a church volunteer brought cookies. The children met Santa at a holiday event the church held for neighborhood children. They spend their days in the converted classroom, or roaming around the church kitchen, open daily for free meals for community members in need. On a recent snow day, they played outdoors, without leaving the church premises and under the watch of volunteers with the sanctuary movement.</p>\n<p>The children, who like their mother have deportation orders, stopped going to school when they went into sanctuary, and Hernández and organizers are evaluating whether to enroll them in Philadelphia public schools in January —  mobilizing the public in hopes that ICE will leave them alone on their way to and from school — or whether to homeschool them at the church. Asked whether the children would be able to attend school, the ICE spokesperson said: “We don’t speculate on pending or proposed enforcement actions but our sensitive location policy remains in effect.”</p>\n<p>Hernández told me she feels safe here, but during our interview she watched nervously every time an elevator door opened. Staff at the church office, who have been trained to identify potential law enforcement officers, asked to verify that I had permission to visit Hernández before allowing me to see her.</p>\n<p>“ICE cannot be trusted,” said Quintana.</p>\n<p>Hernández has been wearing an ankle bracelet since the day she crossed the border on foot from Tijuana to San Diego, more than two years ago. She asked for asylum as soon as she walked into the Unites States, and was told she had to take the ankle bracelet or go back.</p>\n<p>A light on the device flashes red every time the battery is running out, shortly before making a noise and sending a light shock up Hernández’s leg. Since she went into sanctuary, the light has been flashing red even when the battery is fully charged. When she swaps the battery, a message on the bracelet tells her to go see her immigration officer, she said.</p>\n<p>ICE agents have also been calling her cellphone — sometimes late at night. At first, Hernández asked them to talk to her lawyer. “They said we want to speak with you, where are you?” she said. Now she no longer picks up.</p>\n<p>“Ms. Hernández’s is required to check in with ERO Officers,” the ICE spokesperson told The Intercept, adding that trained officers “make a determination on the most appropriate level of case management and technology assignment.”</p>\n<p>“ERO officers do not harass Ms. Hernández,” the spokesperson added, referring to Enforcement and Removal Operations officers.</p>\n<p>Hernández said she fled Mexico after one of her nephews was beheaded by criminal cartels. A second nephew was shot in the head. In July 2015, a month before she left, her brother was killed. Then the man who she believed killed him showed up at her house. He had been demanding 300 pesos a week to leave her alone, but when she couldn’t pay anymore he came and started beating her. When her older daughter, 11 years old at the time, tried to intervene, he pushed her onto a bucket full of glass bottles.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/2-sanctuary-church-mexican-immigrants-ice-deportation-philadelphia-1514149166.jpg\"><img alt=\"Carmela is ceremonially sung to as part of a traditional Mexican holiday ritual called a &quot;posada&quot; where neighbors are invited into eachother's homes, part of the Christmas tradition of welcoming worshippers on holy pilgrimages.

At the border, she was separated from her oldest son. He was 13 at the time, but looked tall for his age, and immigration officials said that Mexicans always lied about their age.</p>\n<p>After being held for three nights and agreeing to the ankle bracelet, Hernández joined a relative in Pennsylvania. Eventually she moved to New Jersey, where she worked in a Mexican shop. Her application for asylum and two appeals were denied.</p>\n<p>Hernández thinks officials didn’t read her application. “They see it says asylum, they say rejected,” she told me. “Without checking why someone is seeking asylum.” Hernández has no idea how long she and her children will have to live in the Advocate’s basement. Her third asylum appeal is pending. The length of sanctuary varies — in Arizona, a man has been living in a church for a year and six months. In Philadelphia, undocumented father Javier Flores Garcia spent nearly a year living in sanctuary at the Arch Street United Methodist Church, before finally leaving in October.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, members of the church joined Hernández and the children for a <em>posada</em> — a holiday tradition in Mexico. For the nine days leading up to Christmas eve, Mexican families reenact Mary and Joseph’s journey to Bethlehem and their search for refuge. Participants move in a procession to friends, family, and neighbors’ homes, where they ask for shelter. The hosts open their homes, and everyone celebrates with tamales and piñatas.</p>\n<p>The parallel to her own journey was not lost on Hernández. “They have given me <em>posada</em> here.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/4-sanctuary-church-mexican-immigrants-ice-deportation-philadelphia-1514149307.jpg\"><img alt=\"Carmela Hernandez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who faces a deportation order along with her four children Fidel, 15, Kayri, 13, Joselyn, 11, and Edwin, 11, found temporary sanctuary from immigration officials by moving her family in early December into a small basement room at the historic African-American Church of the Advocate in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, December 18, 2017.

While in the first year of his administration he has actually deported <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/06/trump-immigration-deportation-dhs/\">fewer people</a> than Obama did in his last  — largely because of the record low number of people crossing the border — Trump has escalated anti-immigrant rhetoric, increased the number of immigration arrests by 42 percent, and disseminated terror in immigrant communities with <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/04/ice-raids-trump-immigration-deportation/\">sweeping raids</a> that have made virtually all undocumented immigrants targets for enforcement.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has also gone to war against sanctuaries — explicitly focusing its enforcement efforts in those cities and states where local authorities have refused to collaborate with ICE. But while battles over the legality of sanctuary are fought in court, the sanctuary movement has grown exponentially — with colleges and universities joining cities, counties, and states in offering refuge from deportation.</p>\n<p>The number of places of worship that have declared themselves sanctuary has doubled since Trump was elected to more than 800, according to Church World Service, a faith-based coalition providing refugee assistance worldwide. The movement includes churches of various denominations as well as synagogues, Hindu temples, and mosques. “I do believe that’s a direct result of the Trump administration targeting communities of color,” said Myrna Orozco Gallos, an organizer with the group, calling sanctuary a “prophetic and moral calling.” “This administration has definitely invited more people to stand up and really live out their calling and their faith by helping their neighbor and loving their neighbor.”</p>\n<p>But not every church is answering the call.</p>\n<p>A Catholic, Hernández first turned to Roman Catholic churches. But the Philadelphia archdiocese has prohibited its priests from offering sanctuary — though, Quintana noted, “many want to do it.” In New Hampshire, Catholic leaders responded to a priest’s declaration of sanctuary by also prohibiting it. In New York, the archdiocese continues to oppose sanctuary despite owning dozens of properties where it could host immigrants, including many empty ones it is now looking to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/nyregion/18-shuttered-catholic-churches-may-soon-be-up-for-sale.html\">sell off</a>.</p>\n<p>“We could be doing something with that space,” said Felix Cepeda, a New York-based Catholic activist. “We do a lot of good work towards charity and providing social services, but when it comes to the challenging the structure of injustice and the people who perpetuate injustice, we need to do more.”</p>\n<p>The archdioceses of Philadelphia and New York did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The concern, in part, is legal. While ICE has so far kept away from churches, there is no guarantee they will continue to do so, and churches don’t have the legal authority to stop law enforcement coming with a legitimate warrant. Churches could also be vulnerable to anti-harboring and anti-trafficking laws. “We hope ICE will respect the way that they choose to show and practice their faith,” said Orozco Gallos. “But there’s always a risk.”</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, Rev. John Fife, a Presbyterian minister in Tucson, Arizona, was the first clergyman in the country to offer sanctuary to refugees from Central America. As the movement quickly spread, the government sent undercover agents to infiltrate it, taping more than 90 conversations between pastors and priests on both sides of the border and even recording worship services. Fife was one of 11 people indicted in the case. “They said that this was a vast international criminal conspiracy to smuggle undocumented people across the border,” he told The Intercept. “We thought that it was a great opportunity to make our legal case, which was that the people that we were helping were refugees.”</p>\n<p>Fife and seven others were eventually found guilty after a judge barred the defense from mentioning conditions in El Salvador and Guatemala or U.S. and international refugee law.</p>\n<p>But the sanctuary movement continued to grow — and Fife and others eventually sued the government over its discriminatory treatment of asylum claims by Guatemalans and Salvadorans. Rather than having the attorney general and other top officials testify, the government agreed to a settlement that included putting a stop to the deportations, granting temporary protected status to refugees from those countries, and reforming the political asylum process.</p>\n<p>While in the 1980s the sanctuary movement was focused on refugees, today’s is extended to migrant families, Fife said, but “in both cases the U.S. government was and is in violation of basic human rights and international law.”</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/5-sanctuary-church-mexican-immigrants-ice-deportation-philadelphia-1514149185.jpg\"><img alt=\"Pastor John Olenick, a member of the New Sanctuary Movement that helped Carmela locate a church to stay in, visits the family to bring a few gifts and see how they are doing.

During the abolitionist movement, churches offered sanctuary to runaway slaves. Before that, Fife adds, “there’s a history of thousands of years of sacred sites in places of worship functioning as sanctuary.” “We didn’t come up with that idea in the 1980s. It’s biblical.”</p>\n<p>To him, the question of sanctuary is an ethical one.</p>\n<p>“How can we claim to be faithful at all and allow the government to deport families and children back to a place where their life is obviously in danger?” he asked. “It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with faith.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Carmela Hernández’s children spend most of their time now on their phones playing games or watching videos, on Dec. 18, 2017. Hernández and her four children Fidel, Kayri, Joselyn  and Edwin found temporary sanctuary from immigration officials in a small basement room at the historic African-American Church of the Advocate in North Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/25/after-going-from-church-to-church-seeking-help-a-mexican-family-finds-sanctuary-in-philadelphia/\">After Going from Church to Church Seeking Help, A Mexican Family Finds Sanctuary in Philadelphia</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">R</span><u>udolph J. Gerber</u> has never forgotten where he was when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty over 45 years ago. He was a new lawyer in Phoenix, working as the associate director of the Arizona Criminal Code Commission. The landmark 1972 ruling in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/69-5030\" target=\"_blank\">Furman v. Georgia</a> invalidated death sentences across the country, including those of 16 people on Arizona’s death row. Outraged politicians vowed to bring back capital punishment; one Phoenix Republican declared his candidacy for Maricopa County attorney that very day.</p>\n<p>The next day, Republican State Sen. Sandra Day O’Connor, a member of Arizona’s Senate  Judiciary Committee, came to Gerber’s office. She dropped the Furman decision on his desk. “I said, ‘What do you think we should do about it?’” Gerber recalled in a recent phone interview. “And her exact words were, ‘Rudy, I want you to write a death penalty we can live with.’”</p>\n<p>To O’Connor – and to the 5-4 majority in Furman – this meant revamping Arizona law to ensure the death penalty was more carefully applied. Gerber was up to the task, although he did not have strong feelings on the matter himself. No one had been executed in Arizona in nearly 10 years. “I thought, well, having a new death penalty law is like having a new tax code,” he said. He began to study the ruling.</p>\n<p>It was an unusual decision. Each of the nine justices had written a separate opinion in Furman. But the prevailing problem was arbitrariness – there was no uniformity in death sentences across the country, nor in the severity of the crimes that sent people to death row. Race and social status were the real drivers of death sentences, making the punishment discriminatory and “freakishly imposed.” Justice Potter Stewart called the death penalty cruel and unusual “in the same way that being struck by lighting is cruel and unusual.”</p>\n<p>Gerber began drafting some standards to define the subset of murders that could be considered most heinous and deserving of death. Consulting the Model Penal Code, he identified six statutory aggravating factors — for example, killing a police officer, murdering for monetary gain, or having previously been convicted of a violent crime.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Gerber watched with dismay as the tough-on-crime era took hold in Arizona. </blockquote>\n<p>O’Connor had told the press that the future of capital punishment should be up to Arizona voters, who widely supported it. Yet most seemed indifferent to the details. Public hearings on the law were poorly attended, according to one Arizona Republic columnist, who described “the rooms half empty, the public apparently unconcerned.” As the law went into effect in 1974, O’Connor successfully ran for a seat on the Maricopa County Superior Court, and was later appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Gerber had gone to work as a prosecutor in Maricopa County when the high court handed down its next major ruling on capital punishment in 1976. Gregg v. Georgia <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-6257\" target=\"_blank\">upheld</a> Georgia’s new death penalty law, a green light to resume executions. To Gerber, the issue was no longer an abstraction. Prosecutors in Arizona had swiftly availed themselves of the law he helped design, without waiting on the court. By the time Gregg came down, they had already sent a dozen people to death row.</p>\n<p>In 1977, Gerber himself sought the death penalty against a man named Joe Clarence Smith, who had brutally murdered a young waitress, stabbing her genitals and stuffing her mouth with dirt. Yet when the time came for the sentencing phase, Gerber found himself conflicted. “Even though I had convicted him and he was a terrible human being, I didn’t think I wanted to see him executed,” he said. A colleague took over and won a death sentence.</p>\n<p>More than 40 years later, Smith has yet to be executed. If Gerber could not have foreseen such a thing in the late ’70s, he soon saw plenty of other problems. “As a draftsman, prosecutor, and then trial judge, watching ‘my’ death penalty statute in action, I came to realize how little I comprehended the nuances and data regarding the day-to-day workings of capital punishment,” he wrote years later in the Stanford Law and Policy Review. Among his central concerns was the immense power granted to prosecutors, who weaponized the death penalty in everything from plea bargains to political campaigns. As time passed, he wrote, “I marveled at the enthusiasm of colleagues and politicians in touting a practice they did not seem to understand.”</p>\n<p>Gerber watched with dismay as the tough-on-crime era took hold in Arizona. As politicians campaigned on harsh sentencing, they introduced bill after bill adding new aggravators to make people eligible for the death penalty. The once-narrow list of aggravating factors “crept and expanded to absurd, broad categories,” Gerber said, such as “heinous” and “depraved,” and perhaps most bizarre, “without legal justification.”</p>\n<p>Today, there are 14 aggravating factors that can send a defendant to death in Arizona. Ironically, the very mechanism that was supposed to fix the death penalty “has put us right back into the arbitrariness and caprice that was condemned in Furman,” Gerber said. “We have come full circle, even with good intentions.”</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Arizona-state-prison-Hidalgo-1513972001.jpg\"><img alt=\"FILE - In this July 23, 2014, file photo, a fence surrounds the state prison in Florence, Ariz., where the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood took place.

The case, <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hidalgo-v-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\">Hidalgo v. Arizona</a>,  challenges Arizona’s death penalty law for being overly broad, in violation of the Constitution. Filed on behalf of Abel Daniel Hidalgo — and brought by former Obama Solicitor General Neal Katyal — the petition does not stop there. It argues that the time has come to abolish capital punishment altogether. “The death penalty is unconstitutional,” Hidalgo argues, “full stop.”\n<p>Hidalgo has been closely watched for months. It is the latest attempt to rise to a challenge put forth in 2015 by Justice Stephen Breyer in his impassioned dissent in <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/30/justice-breyers-dissent-lethal-injection-showed-death-penaltys-defenders/\" target=\"_blank\">Glossip v. Gross</a>. Breyer famously laid out the myriad problems with death penalty — from the decades prisoners spend in isolation to the risk of executing the innocent — and called for “a full briefing” on the constitutionality of capital punishment. Katyal argues that Hidalgo is the ideal vehicle, describing Arizona as a microcosm of the flaws Breyer described and “an exemplar of the arbitrariness in the imposition of the death penalty in the United States.”</p>\n<p>While the chances of success for any petition before the court are slim, some express cautious optimism that it might take at least the first question. “Arizona has reached a point that is pretty clearly in violation of Gregg v. Georgia,” Gerber said. The ruling was premised on the notion that the death penalty should be narrowly applied in the most egregious cases. Yet Hidalgo includes data showing that 99 percent of murders over an 11-year period in Maricopa County included at least one aggravator. “When virtually all first-degree murders are eligible for death, the ‘worst of the worst’ requirement turns on its head,” Gerber <a href=\"https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/11/14/arizona-death-penalty-law-flouts-constitution/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in November. Even the Maricopa Superior Court judge who most recently <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/05/08/judge-upholds-arizona-death-penalty-law/27020199/\" target=\"_blank\">upheld</a> Arizona’s law found this data disconcerting, calling it “problematic from a constitutional standpoint.”</p>\n<p>Hidalgo has been repeatedly listed and re-listed for conference by the court, most recently appearing on its December 8 calendar. But it was delayed again after the justices requested the full record from the state — a sign someone wants to take a closer look. As 2017 comes to a close, the fate of Hidalgo will wait until the new year.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the death penalty continues its precipitous <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/death-penalty-harris-county-texas/\">decline</a>. In its end-of-year <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/2017YrEnd.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> for 2017, which tracks the ever-dwindling executions and death sentences, the Death Penalty Information Center identified three “outlier” counties responsible for a disproportionate percentage of all new death sentences. Maricopa County was one of them. There, prosecutors handed down their latest death sentence just last month, in the case of 29-year-old <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/11/16/john-allen-death-sentence-ame-deal-murder/872414001/\" target=\"_blank\">John Allen</a>, convicted of murder and child abuse. His wife, Sammantha, was <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/08/07/sammantha-allen-death-penalty-life-in-prison-verdict-ame-deal-footlocker-death-phoenix/533618001/\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced</a> to die for the same crime just a few months earlier, becoming the third woman on Arizona’s death row.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">The once-narrow list of aggravating factors “crept and expanded to absurd, broad categories.”</blockquote>\n<p>The enduring zeal for the death penalty in Maricopa County is partly the legacy of one man: Andrew Thomas, elected county attorney in 2004. In his first two years, death penalty prosecutions <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/us/05death.html\">nearly doubled</a> in Maricopa County. In <a href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/money-pit-andy-thomas-death-penalty-laden-years-as-maricopa-county-attorney-6452600\">one</a> of many articles about Thomas, the Phoenix New Times described “one fairly typical case from that era,” in which Maricopa County prosecutors sought death against a man for killing someone while drunken driving – “only the second time in the nation’s history that’s happened.”</p>\n<p>“He overused the death penalty,” Gerber recalled. What’s more, Thomas found an ally in his campaign: notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had campaigned alongside him. Gerber is blunt in saying the two men shared a racist bias against Latinos, who receive death sentences in disproportionate numbers in Arizona. When a crime was committed by a Latino, “for Andrew Thomas, one of the first responses was well, let’s fry ’em. Let’s put ’em to death.”</p>\n<p>The effect was partly captured by Arizona Attorney Magazine, which ran a two-part series in 2009 titled “The Capital Case Crisis In Maricopa County: What (Little) We Can Do About It.” The authors had planned to call for an empirical study of the cost of capital cases, only to realize that the situation was too dire; it was clear that there was an alarming backlog of capital cases in the county. There were not enough qualified judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and other specialists available to handle them.</p>\n<p>Thomas was ultimately disbarred by the Arizona Supreme Court, which <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6541\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> he “outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law.” He was expelled in 2012. Today, Maricopa County still stands apart, but prosecutors have wielded their power similarly at different times throughout the state. In Pinal County, which is home to Arizona’s death row, the election of far-right County Attorney Lando Voyles in 2012 brought an unprecedented surge in capital prosecutions. Voyles, who was from Maricopa County, “embarked on a crusade to basically try to get everybody the death penalty that had committed a first-degree murder,” recalls James Mannato, a veteran attorney in Florence, Arizona, and currently the county’s public defender. Within a few years, death penalty cases had tripled in Pinal County. “It serves to highlight the issue that’s now being presented in Hidalgo’s petition,” Mannato said.</p>\n<p>To Mannato, the problem comes down to power. “It’s hard, really, for people sometimes to resist the urge to seek death penalty because it’s simply so easy to do it, and it gives any prosecutor the ultimate amount of leverage,” he said. Regardless, voters did not seem to have much patience for Voyles, who lost re-election in 2016 amid accusations of overreach and overspending, including on capital prosecutions, which <a href=\"http://www.pinalcentral.com/maricopa_monitor/comment/editor_s_view/dispatch-editorial-death-penalty-cases-in-pinal-could-prove-costly/article_4c89f20f-4310-57b9-a8d9-b79855581bbd.html\" target=\"_blank\">cost</a> half a million dollars each.</p>\n<p>Mannato was optimistic about Hidalgo’s chances before the Supreme Court. “I think they’re going to take it,” he said, “and I think the reason is because the momentum’s been building across the country against the death penalty.” State legislators continue to <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/recent-legislative-activity\" target=\"_blank\">pass</a> abolition legislation, governors keep imposing moratoriums, and fewer and fewer juries are sentencing people to death. “They’ve done what they think is morally correct without waiting for the Supreme Court to tell them.”</p>\n<p><span data-shortcode-type=\"dropcap\">T</span><u>oday, Rudy Gerber</u> is retired and living is California, where attempts to end the death penalty by ballot initiative have repeatedly <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/11/11/the-death-penalty-won-big-on-election-day-but-the-devil-is-in-the-details/\" target=\"_blank\">failed</a>. The state is home to Riverside County — another death penalty outlier — as well as the country’s largest death row. The story of how it got this way has parallels to Arizona: a widening net of factors made defendants eligible for the death penalty. “They don’t call them aggravators, they call them special circumstances here,” he said. “But the result is exactly the same. Upwards of 90 percent of California murderers fall into one or more of the special circumstances.” It is another reason Hidalgo should interest the Supreme Court. “A number of states, not just Arizona, are in the same place.”</p>\n<p>In California, the issue dates back to 1978, when a lawyer named Don Heller drafted a pro-death penalty ballot initiative that would pass overwhelmingly, expanding the use of special circumstances in capital cases. Like Gerber, Heller soon began questioning what he’d done. A wave of California prosecutors immediately sought death sentences. “Everyone was trying to put a notch on their gun. There were a tremendous number of capital cases filed,” he <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/01/17/ten-years-after-last-execution-californias-death-row-continues-to-grow/\" target=\"_blank\">told me</a> in 2016. The state’s death penalty population surged — today it hovers at 750. Yet only 13 executions have been carried out since then. The fight over lethal injection has kept the state mired in costly litigation.</p>\n<p>In Arizona, executions have been on hold since the botched killing of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/07/23/arizona-supreme-court-stays-planned-execution/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Wood</a>, a harrowing, two-hour ordeal that made headlines across the world. Similar episodes have occurred across death penalty states. In Ohio this year, the state failed to kill 69-year-old <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/19/cruel-and-unusual-a-second-failed-execution-in-ohio/\" target=\"_blank\">Alva Campbell</a> — the second time in less than a decade a man has left the state’s death chamber alive.</p>\n<p>Other botched executions are discussed in a 2007 <a href=\"https://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=E1031C\" target=\"_blank\">book</a> co-authored by Gerber, which also shows how, even when all appears to have gone smoothly, people who attend or carry out executions are forever altered. One Arizona woman featured in the book — a former lower court judge named Donna Leone Hamm — describes a sick feeling of complicity, even as a death penalty opponent. “You stood and watched a man die,” she said. “You did nothing to stop it. You could not have stopped it, but you didn’t even try.”</p>\n<p>Hamm’s husband was incarcerated on drug charges in Arizona during the 1980s. When she began coming to see him in prison in those years, she told me, “I realized they treated me very, very differently when I was touring the prisons as a judge then they did when I became a visitor.” When her husband was released, they started an advocacy group called <a href=\"http://www.middlegroundprisonreform.org\" target=\"_blank\">Middle Ground Prison Reform</a>. It was around this time, in 1992, that Arizona finally carried out its first post-Gregg execution, with Hamm as a witness. It was a major media event. She remembers seeing flowers planted alongside the death house and “velvet ropes” upon entering the viewing room, as if “you’re in line to go see a movie.”</p>\n<p>“It was disgusting,” she said. The man, Donald Harding, died in the gas chamber, wearing nothing but an adult diaper. Witnesses commented on his pasty white skin; Hamm became convinced it was primarily for humiliation. Harding stuck up his middle finger as the execution began, which “everybody talked about and wrote about.” Today, Hamm is unsure about Hidalgo’s chances at the Supreme Court. But she does not believe Arizona will end the death penalty on its own.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Ray-Krone-exonerated-1513965978.jpg\"><img alt=\"Juan Melendez, center, who is the 99th person exonerated out of 101 people released from death row since capital punishment's reemergence in 1976, watches Illinois Deputy Governor for Criminal Justice Policy Matt Bettenhausen testify on a special televised linkup to a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution hearing on Capitol Hill looking into &quot;reducing the risk of executing the innocent: the report of the Illinois Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment,&quot; Wednesday, June 12, 2002, in Washington.

In 2002, Krone became the 100th person exonerated from death row in the U.S. “I wish I could say my story is unusual,” he wrote. “But the truth is, 160 men and women have been exonerated and freed from death row since 1973.” He called on the Supreme Court to take up Hidalgo and abolish the death penalty for good.\n<p>More than perhaps any other issue, a growing awareness of wrongful convictions has likely helped shift public opinion favoring the death penalty to its current historic lows. In Arizona, Hidalgo points out, nine people have been exonerated from death row. (And cases like that of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/23/barry-jones-arizona-death-row-rachel-gray/\">Barry Jones</a>, convicted in 1995, show there is good reason to believe there are other innocent people facing execution in the state.) After the 2015 exoneration of Debra Milke, the Arizona Republic ran a series on capital punishment. As Gerber recalls, the stories generated a great deal of debate, even among “back-row conservatives.” Recent exonerations in Arizona have forced people in Maricopa County to confront the reality that innocent people are sentenced to die — “and that maybe it’s time to just get rid of it.”</p>\n<p>This shift in mindset includes Sandra Day O’Connor herself. After 25 years on the Supreme Court bench, often providing a swing vote in death penalty cases, she retired in 2006. One day toward the end of her term, in 2001, she gave a speech before the Minnesota Women Lawyers. It made <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/04/us/o-connor-questions-death-penalty.html\" target=\"_blank\">headlines</a>. “If statistics are any indication,” O’Connor said, “the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed.”</p>\n<p>When Gerber heard of her comments, he was surprised. When he knew her all those years ago in Phoenix, she “would have never said that,” he said. “So something happened in her tenure on the Supreme Court. Maybe studying these capital cases that opened her mind to the possibility that maybe some innocent people have been executed,” he said. “But I cannot speak for her, then or now.”</p>\n<p>Whether O’Connor would vote to take Hidalgo if she were still on the bench is impossible to know. But her feelings on capital punishment certainly appear to have evolved. Speaking to her audience members in Minnesota, she noted that their state did not have the death penalty. “You must breathe a big sigh of relief every day.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: A police officer warns activists to leave during an anti-death penalty protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 17, 2017 in Washington.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/24/arizona-death-penalty-supreme-court/\">Can the Supreme Court Continue to Live with Our Arbitrary and Capricious Death Penalty?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

After being imprisoned on Canto Bight for parking their spaceship on a private beach, our heroes escape — in part — by corralling Dickensian child laborers to release a pack of abused extraterrestrial racehorses that then crash through the casino like Jesus cleansing the temple of money lenders.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>With “</span><span>The Last Jedi</span><span>,” “Star Wars” has chosen a side in the class war.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>The franchise’s bread and butter has always been a kind of good-and-evil moralizing that transcended earthly politics, with plenty to grasp onto for people on all sides. <span>Libertarians could glom onto Han Solo’s mercenary entrepreneurship. Leftists could see the rebellion in terms of their own scrappy, uphill battle against authoritarians in our own time. Liberals could celebrate the reverence for the republican institution of the Senate. In 2002, conservative writer Jonathan V. Last </span><a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-case-for-the-empire/article/2540\"><span>wrote</span></a><span> in </span><span>The Weekly Standard </span><span>that, “The deep lesson of Star Wars is that the Empire is good,” calling Emperor Palpatine — the main villain and ouright authoritarian of the original trilogy and prequels — an “esoteric Straussian.” </span></span></p>\n<p><span>“Make no mistake,” he writes, “as emperor, Palpatine is a dictator — but a relatively benign one, like Pinochet. It’s a dictatorship people can do business with. … The Empire has virtually no effect on the daily life of the average, law-abiding citizen.” Bill Kristol </span><a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/on-star-wars-and-conversations/article/2006111\"><span>defended</span></a><span> the position at the time and again more recently, </span><a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/10/bill-kristol-tried-to-defend-the-galactic-empire-on-twitter/\"><span>tweeting</span></a><span> that there remains “no objective evidence Empire was ‘evil.’” Conservative blog </span><span>The Federalist </span><span>used its </span><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2017/12/19/last-jedi-blasts-heart-star-wars-declaring-war-past/\"><span>review </span></a><span>of “</span><span>The Last Jedi” </span><span>to mount a quasi-defense of eugenics and Confederate monuments.</span></p>\n<p><span>Unsurprisingly, </span><span>The Federalist</span><span> was not a fan of the most recent film — and for good reason. “</span><span>The Last Jedi” </span><span>is a “</span><span>Star Wars”</span><span> for populist times and a kind of remake of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary that sides firmly with the left.</span></p>\n<p><span>Luke Skywalker spends most of the film disparaging the importance of “that mighty Skywalker blood,” all while his nephew and apprentice, Sith, far-right failson (Kylo Ren) tries to live out the birthright-to-evil supposedly gifted from his grandfather, Darth Vader. Rey, grasping for her own prestigious lineage, wants him to teach her the ways of the Jedi, only to be told forcefully that the Jedi themselves — a centuries-old religious order that once functioned as a kind of unaccountable, elite, interplanetary police force — should fade into memory. “To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity,” Luke says.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The legacy of the Jedi is failure,” Luke tells us. The golden age of the Jedi — as seen in the prequels — helped sow the seeds for Vader and Palpatine’s reign, and it was the Jedi academy that helped turn Anakin Skywalker into a mass murderer. </span></p>\n<p><span>It’s a rebuke of elite politics and the rule of experts, whether they wield spreadsheets or light sabers, and it’s a welcome</span> <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/retcon-history-and-meaning\"><span>retcon</span></a><span> of the prequels’ eugenicist argument that access to the force is genetic destiny. Rey — perhaps the most powerful force-user in generations, speculated to be the long-lost spawn of either Luke or Obi-Wan Kenobi — is the child of “nothing” junk traders who, as foe Kylo Ren tells her, probably “sold her off for drinking money.” Rose apologizes for being a lowly worker to Finn and stands in awe of him before — just moments later — exposing him as a coward. </span></p>\n<p><span>What “</span><span>The Last Jedi” </span><span>advises is a radical break from resistance as we know it: abandoning old tactics and loyalties and handing the keys — or at least more of them — over to the grassroots: the mechanics, the child laborers, the Ewoks, and the rebel foot-soldiers. The resistance of the “Star Wars” films has never been particularly visionary, operating as a kind of top-down, underground rebellion looking to reconstitute the New Republic of the prequels. Its biggest heroes have been messiah figures, princesses, and the so-called great men.</span></p>\n<p><span>The biggest heroes of “The </span><span>Last Jedi</span><span>,” by contrast, are the proletariat — working stiffs who’ve gotten the short shrift throughout the franchise. They’re also mostly women, and many are people of color — not unlike the</span><a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/new-working-class-precarity-race-gender-democrats\"> <span>makeup of the American working-class</span></a><span>. Rebel Admiral Leia Organa stays true to her roots as a class traitor and longtime consort to rebel scum: staying the course and boosting morale in the darkest of times, while occasionally pulling out some crazy impressive force powers for the greater good. When hotshot resistance pilot Poe Dameron flies off the handle seeking glory, Leia brings him down to earth via a well-placed blaster shot.</span></p>\n<p><span>Luke’s solitary retreat to the mystical Jedi home-world of Ahch-To seems less heroic by contrast, even self-indulgent compared to Leia’s lifetime of resisting evil empire through the </span><span>obliteration of her entire planet</span><span> and </span><span>murder of the love of her life at the hands of her own son</span><span>. By the end of the film, she’s still at it, investing faith in Rey — a former trash-picking drifter — to help lead the way forward alongside a fledgling young army of rebels, force-using, and otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span>You don’t need an encyclopedic knowledge of a galaxy far, far away to understand that today’s resistance needs fresh blood: new fighters and new strategies, but a new vision as well. Reconstituting the New Republic — the Obama era, in our case — can only stave off the Sith for so long before recreating the same flaws that let the Empire take power the first time around. The Rebellion needs to be reborn nearly wholesale to win anything but pyrrhic victories.</span></p>\n<p><span>As self-styled #Resistance members are lifting up America’s political dynasties as the best hope to save us from Trump, knocking the Skywalkers’s importance down a peg in the “Star Wars” franchise lands close to home amid </span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/20/how-to-beat-trump-2020-elections-generic-democrat-216121\"><span>calls for “generic” Democratic candidates</span></a><span> and liberal pining for the Obama years. All the consultants and name recognition in the world couldn’t win the 2016 election for the Democrats — and in all likelihood probably hurt their cause. If “</span><span>The Last Jedi” </span><span>has a political takeaway, it’s for political revolution and a bottom-up transformation of not just who’s in power, but who gets to decide how that revolution happens.</span></p>\n<p><span>The new film’s plot holes and a messy storyline are good fodder for critics, but let’s leave that for them. In the meantime, it’s hard not to watch the First Order picking off rebel ships and think of the first several weeks of the Trump administration; the onslaught of attacks on everything from immigrant rights to the environment. This is a long fight, and a lot of people will die. Victories are few and far between, and casualties are mounting. “</span><span>The</span> <span>Last Jedi” </span><span>self-consciously brings the rebellion into the resistance. Let your heroes and old dogmas die. Rebel scum have nothing to lose but their chains.</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn (John Boyega) in “Stars Wars: The Last Jedi.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/24/star-wars-last-jedi-class-politics/\">“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” Takes a Side in the Class War</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Foi um ano em que os homens que tomaram o poder em Brasília sacramentaram as mesmas políticas públicas rejeitadas reiteradamente pelo povo nas urnas.</span></p>\n<p><span>Em vez de fazer uma retrospectiva dos principais acontecimentos do ano, resolvi fazer uma que traga alguns assuntos que foram estrategicamente esquecidos pelos conglomerados de mídia do país. Como acontece todos os anos, assuntos de grande importância não ganham o merecido destaque e acabam morrendo em notinhas de rodapé. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Os escândalos de José Serra</b></p>\n<p><span>Em 2016, escrevi duas colunas intituladas</span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/14/o-fenomeno-jose-serra/\" target=\"_blank\"><span> “O fenômeno José Serra”</span></a><span> e </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/11/06/o-fenomeno-jose-serra-parte-ii/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>“O fenômeno José Serra – Parte II”</span></a><span>, que basicamente tratavam da capacidade de escapar ileso na grande mídia mesmo tendo seu nome envolvido em grandes escândalos. É o Houdini brasileiro! Nesses artigos tentei demonstrar que as notícias desfavoráveis ao senador seguem o padrão snapchat: ficam 24 horas no ar e depois somem.</span></p>\n<p><span>Em 2017, José Serra continua sendo um fenômeno. Seu nome aparece em diversos casos de corrupção, mas não vemos colunistões da Globo especulando e vociferando contra ele, nem capas de revistas semanais lhe tratando como um criminoso. </span></p>\n<p><span>Nunca mais se falou a respeito da suposta conta na Suíça em que ele teria recebido R$ 23 milhões em propinas da Odebrecht. Depois de uma manchetinha aqui e outra ali, escândalos do Serra caem em um buraco negro </span><span>–</span><span> um fenômeno que nunca ocorreu com Jucá, Geddel e até mesmo Aécio, que até pouco tempo atrás também desfrutava da amnésia midiática.</span></p>\n<p><span>Eu aposto que você nem se lembra que Serra contratou uma funcionária fantasma para seu gabinete. Sim, o nome dela é Margrit Dutra Schmidt, uma grande amiga que Serra prefere chamar de Mag. E quem é a Mag? Bom, ela é ex-mulher do ex-lobista Fernando Lemos e irmã de Miriam Dutra </span><span>–</span><span> a polêmica ex-amante de FHC. Ela recebia salário sem jamais ter comparecido ao trabalho. Fosse qualquer outro político o protagonista desse escândalo, nós já estaríamos sabendo até a marca da ração preferida do cachorrinho da funcionária fantasma.</span></p>\n<p><span>Nesse ano, enquanto o Titanic de Temer afundava na lama, Serra pediu demissão e saiu à francesa alegando problemas de saúde. A imprensa respeitou e ficou um bom tempo sem tocar em seu nome. Depois desse período sabático, o tucano reaparece saudável, já </span><a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/serra-avisa-psdb-que-pensa-em-concorrer-ao-governo-de-sp-em-2018-22032933\" target=\"_blank\"><span>articulando uma candidatura</span></a><span> para o governo de São Paulo.

O tucano continua ostentando a mesma imagem dos anos 1990: um cidadão correto, pai de família, trabalhador, filho de feirantes da Móoca. Agora feche os olhos por um momento e tente imaginar como seria o tratamento midiático se o protagonista desses mesmos escândalos atendesse pelo nome de Luis Inácio.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>O depoimento de Rodrigo Tacla Duran </b></p>\n<p><span>Este é um assunto que definitivamente não interessou nem um pouco à imprensa. Tacla Duran é um ex-advogado da Odebrecht acusado pela Lava Jato por envolvimento nas fraudes de licitações da Petrobrás. Segundo o Ministério Público, o seu escritório era responsável por lavar a grana das propinas das construtoras envolvidas no esquema.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ele atuava como doleiro e foi preso no final de 2016 na Espanha, mas não pôde ser extraditado por ter cidadania espanhola e, portanto, responde o processo em liberdade. </span></p>\n<p><span>Desde agosto, Tacla Duran tem acusado o advogado Carlos Zucolotto, padrinho de casamento de Sergio Moro e ex-sócio de sua mulher, de negociar clandestinamente uma delação premiada. O doleiro afirma que Zucolotto teria oferecido abrandamento da pena e diminuição da multa em troca de um pagamento de R$5 milhões, que seria feito por caixa dois. </span></p>\n<p><span>Sergio Moro se pronunciou apenas uma vez sobre o caso. Afirmou que o amigo é “sério e competente” e que é </span><span> </span><span>“lamentável que a palavra de um acusado foragido da Justiça brasileira seja utilizada para levantar suspeitas infundadas sobre a atuação da Justiça”.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ora, ora. Se a espinha dorsal da Lava Jato está baseada em delações de criminosos, por que justamente agora devemos desqualificar a declaração de um? É claro que, como qualquer delator da Lava Jato, Tacla Duran pode estar mentindo. Mas depois das provas apresentadas por ele em uma sessão da CPI da JBS, fica difícil desacreditar completamente no doleiro. </span></p>\n<p><span>Durante depoimento de quase quatro horas via teleconferência, Duran apresentou imagens de conversas por celular em que o padrinho de casamento de Sergio Moro admite que está intermediando os detalhes do acordo de delação com um misterioso “DD”. Duran submeteu as imagens à perícia da </span><a href=\"https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2017/12/05/pericia-afirma-que-fotos-da-conversa-entre-tacla-duran-e-amigo-de-moro-sao-originais/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Associação Espanhola de Peritos</span></a><span>, que garantiu serem verdadeiras.</span></p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/cz-1514118076.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/cz-1514118076-540x392.jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-164033\"></a> <p>Reprodução</p></div>\n<p><span>E qual foi a reação de Zucolotto, Moro e cia diante do depoimento de Duran na CPI? Nenhuma. Silêncio absoluto. Zucolotto não apareceu nem para negar que houve a conversa. </span></p>\n<p><span>Os integrantes da Lava Jato, que reiteradamente opinam sobre acontecimentos políticos que estão fora da sua alçada de trabalho e só faltam convocar coletiva para comentar rodada do Brasileirão, se calaram diante das acusações.</span></p>\n<p><span>Curiosamente, no mesmo dia em que Duran prestou depoimento na CPI, a esposa de Sergio Moro</span><a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2017/11/30/mulher-de-moro-anuncia-desativacao-de-pagina-de-homenagens-no-facebook-e-pede-voto-consciente.htm?utm_content=geral&utm_campaign=twt-noticias&utm_source=t.com&utm_medium=social\" target=\"_blank\"><span> deletou a página “Eu moro com ele”</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>A grande mídia, que nunca viu problema em dar manchete às declarações de delatores, silenciou sobre o caso de forma constrangedora. Tirando uma notinha aqui e outra ali, o depoimento de Tacla Duran na CPI foi tratado com o mais absoluto desprezo e passou longe das capas dos jornais e portais. Não teve uma grande empresa interessada em mandar um jornalista para Espanha e fazer uma grande reportagem sobre o assunto.

Depois de uma investigação que durou sete meses, as jornalistas Alexandra Borges e Judite França reuniram fartas e contundentes provas que sustentam a participação da Igreja Universal em tráfico internacional de crianças.</p>\n<p><span>Atuando desde 1989 em Portugal, a Igreja Universal administrava um abrigo para crianças carentes em Lisboa, batizado de Lar Universal, que funcionou ilegalmente entre 1994 e 2001. Mães em situação de vulnerabilidade deixavam seus filhos aos cuidados do abrigo, mas depois de algum tempo nunca mais os viam. Sem o consentimento das mães, as crianças eram adotadas por bispos e pastores da Igreja Universal ao redor do mundo. </span></p>\n<p><span>Segundo a TVI, os três netos de Edir Macedo foram roubados de suas mães biológicas. O bispo Romualdo, integrante da cúpula da igreja, também teria adotado uma criança da mesma maneira.</span></p>\n<p><span>A reportagem virou um documentário de dez episódios que vêm sendo exibidos na TV portuguesa durante as últimas duas semanas. Há apresentação de diversos documentos e depoimentos de pais e mães que tiveram seus filhos roubados. A Igreja Universal nega tudo e diz que irá processar a emissora. </span></p>\n<p><span>No Brasil, não há um grande veículo sequer tratando seriamente do assunto. Nem o MBL, </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/17/as-novas-senhoras-de-santana/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>sempre muito preocupado com as criancinhas</span></a><span>, se pronunciou sobre esse caso tenebroso. A Folha de São Paulo foi a única que, ainda que timidamente, </span><a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/12/1944379-supostas-vitimas-da-igreja-universal-miram-governo-portugues.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"><span>publicou</span></a><span> algo sobre o assunto. Todas as outras grandes empresas de comunicação estão caladas. Até mesmo a Globo, que nunca perdeu uma oportunidade de tirar uma casquinha da Record, noticiou a acusação.

        "content": "<p><u>On the night</u> of December 2, 2017, a Honduran woman in the rural province of Olancho was protesting what she saw as a stolen election. The woman, eight months pregnant, stood in the streets in violation of a national curfew, and she screamed alongside a rebellious multitude, “Fuera JOH!” (“Out JOH!”), referring to the incumbent president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who many believe fraudulently rigged the elections in his favor to maintain power. The Honduran military and police forces had flooded the streets to enforce the curfew, and the woman was shot in her abdomen, reportedly by a soldier. She was rushed to a nearby clinic where her baby was delivered by emergency cesarean. The child was born with a gunshot wound to the leg.</p>\n<p>The curfew and violence were sparked by a strange, contested election. On the day before Hondurans went to the polls, The Economist <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21731725-recording-obtained-economist-suggests-it-may-be-merits-investigation-hondurass\">published evidence</a> of what seemed to be a plan by Hernández’s National Party to commit systematic fraud. The next day, November 26, the election results came in choppy waves: first a sizable lead by Hernández’s opponent, Salvador Nasralla, and then the electronic voting system went off the air. When the system came back up, Hernández was winning. He was then proclaimed victor by a thin margin. International observers <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/11/honduras-guarantee-credibility-elections-protect-free-expression\">noted</a> “strong indications of election fraud,” and a partial recount still handed the win to Hernández. Packed protests and militarized streets followed. As of December 22, human rights organizations in the country have counted more than 30 people killed by security forces, at least four of whom were under the age of 18.</p>\n<p>After delivering the wounded baby, the doctor at the clinic sent mother and child to a hospital in Olancho for specialized care. Then, shaken by the experience, the doctor shared with a handful of peers several photographs he had taken of the patients, which he framed carefully to excise their faces. After someone uploaded the photos to Facebook, the doctor received death threats. Although he refused to speak on the record for fear for his safety, the doctor doesn’t know who threatened him. In this province, there’s a sense that danger could come from anywhere.</p>\n<p>“I know it sounds conspiratorial,” a journalist from Olancho who followed the baby’s case told me, “but Olancho and the whole eastern fringe of the country are covered in a sort of fog, more than anything due to the drugs that move through the place.” The journalist requested anonymity, like everyone else, because of fear. The journalist’s grandmother worked on a farm in Olancho where 14 people, including religious clergy, were killed in a <a href=\"http://radioprogresohn.net/~rprog/index.php/comunicaciones/noticias/item/1128-a-39-a%C3%B1os-prevalece-impunidad-en-masacre-de-los-horcones\">massacre during land reform protests</a> in 1975. Three more family members died violently between 2012 and 2014, two of them in Olancho. And in the next two years, 19 of the journalist’s family members left the province for the United States, undocumented and desperate.</p>\n<p>Similar stories abound. In fact, this reality permeates Honduras, although in Olancho it has a particular flavor. It’s rooted in corruption fed by the Honduran and international elite for generations. Atop this foundation, the 2017 electoral conflict rages – a pyre into which one can be born already a victim of gun violence.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Olancho-municipal-1513956993.jpg\"><img alt=\"Municipal office in Concordia on Aug. 3, 2015.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Olancho-municipal-1513956993-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-163761\"></a>\n<p>Municipal office in Concordia, in the Honduran province of Olancho, on Aug. 3, 2015.</p>\n<p>Photo: Danielle Mackey</p></div><br>\n<u>Olancho is the</u> “Wild West” of Honduras, a nickname used even by the <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/05TEGUCIGALPA2445_a.html\">U.S. Embassy</a>. It has a slate of mottos to match: “The Sovereign Republic of Olancho,” where it’s “easy to get in, tough to make it out,” and whose swaggering armed cowboys are called “olan-machos.” It has been historically dominated by three gold-rush trades that yielded fortunes for a few: cattle ranching, logging, and mining. Olancho is the birthplace of a <a href=\"http://clasarchive.berkeley.edu/Research/graduate/summer2000/graham/graham.html\">legendary bandit</a>, a land of families that evolved into rival clans, where residents are known to claim their nationality first as Olanchano. And in keeping with the autonomous character, Olancho is politically divided: One population center, Juticalpa, is home to the rancher and former president from the right-wing National Party, Porfirio Lobo, so Juticalpa is loyally Nationalist. The other population center, Catacamas, favors Manuel Zelaya, a logger raised there who later became the leftist president ousted in a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/29/honduras-coup-us-defense-departmetnt-center-hemispheric-defense-studies-chds/\">2009 coup</a>. The rest of Olancho falls somewhere in between or nowhere at all. Another of the province’s mottos describes the divide: tierra de nadie, no man’s land.\n<p>The province of Olancho is larger than the entire neighboring country of El Salvador. It spans much of the eastern end of Honduras. This location has been especially unlucky since 2006, when the pressure of the American drug war rerouted most trafficking off its previous route and instead directly through Central America. Olancho, and the eastern Honduran fringe it dominates, has become a corridor: To the south is the land border with Nicaragua; to the north and east, the Caribbean, which functions as a sea border with producers in South America and consumers in the north. Drugs are forced through whether they float, drive, or fly. “The problem we live is geopolitical — there’s no doubt about that,” said Bertha Oliva, an Olancho native and human rights <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/bertha-oliva-cofadeh-nominated-nobel-prize\">defender</a>, in an interview in her Tegucigalpa office.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">In Olancho, there’s a sense that danger could come from anywhere.</blockquote>\n<p>Olancho is gorgeous, with elevated cloud forests flush with orchids and fresh water that tumbles down majestic cliffs, spilling into lowland rainforests or emerald rolling pastures and valleys. But a sinister history lies below the surface and reveals itself only indirectly. As in the white-tipped fence posts that line acres alongside the Olancho highway: a ranch <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/property-seizures-cia-linked-narco-latest-blow-honduras-impunity/\">until recently</a> owned by Juan Ramón Matta-Ballesteros, the man contracted by the CIA to run its planes during Iran-Contra, who later engineered the union of the Colombian and Mexican cartels in Central America. Or the unassuming stucco building in a cove off another local highway, marked by a weathered metal sign at the entrance: “El Aguacate Military Runway” — once the landing pad for covert, illegal U.S. supplies en route to the Contras in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p>Years later, olanchanos faced new terrors — no longer an imperial counterinsurgency but the drug trade. They remember that time as a free-for-all. Drug planes used the highways as airstrips at midnight. Bulletproof vehicles circulated without license plates, and everyone else had to drive with windows rolled down so they could be easily identifiable as an unthreatening local. There were gun battles at all hours and targeted killings to eliminate people the narcos considered undesirable: gang members, transgender women, street children. And perhaps more than anything, cocaine for individual consumption was available everywhere: around the corner, in the park, at the neighborhood fruit stand. Narcos often paid their Olancho help in-kind.</p>\n<p>Interdiction data extracted from the U.S. government’s Consolidated Counterdrug Database show that the amount of cocaine seized in Honduras tripled from 2005 to 2006, hitting 21,320 kilograms. Annual totals remained similarly high until 2009, the year of the coup, when the total skyrocketed again to 70,272 kg. Then, between 2010 and 2011, U.S. federal government agencies reported almost 250,000 kg of cocaine intercepted in Honduras.</p>\n<p>Tegucigalpa, aided by Washington, began a <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/20/2036836_honduras-ct-police-arrested-3-narcos-in-olancho-.html\">crackdown</a> that was visible to olanchanos by 2011. Special forces police, in units known as Cobras and Tigres, accompanied by the military and public prosecutors office, raided mansions, hotels, construction firms, meat-packing plants, mayoral offices, outlet stores, mineral mines, and <a href=\"https://elfaro.net/es/201709/centroamerica/20882/Una-finca-de-animales.htm\">private zoos</a> throughout Olancho in the next few years. The Cobras police remained to occupy some areas. Residents say they frequently saw U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents accompanying raids. U.S. agencies registered a drop in intercepted kilograms in 2012 – to just over 68,000 kg – and by 2014, the amount had fallen to about 30,000 kg. In response to the repression, the narcos went underground.</p>\n<p>But the narcos who ran wild in Olancho weren’t in charge of the game. The chessboard masters are the elite. In January 2015, the leader of one of Olancho’s own cartels, the Cachiros, was among those caught and extradited to face trial in the Southern District of New York. Once on the stand, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/son-of-honduras-ex-president-arrested-for-drug-trafficking/\">pointed</a> the DEA to Fabio Lobo, the son of the Olancho cattleman and former president. Fabio was later arrested in Haiti, and his personal cadre of police, who ensured safe passage for the drugs, was arrested in Honduras. Then Hernández’s brother was called to Washington to answer for his apparent <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-york/articles/2017-03-16/trafficker-says-he-met-with-the-honduran-presidents-brother\">involvement</a> with a major trafficker. That same month in a different case, when a Mexican trafficker-turned-DEA informant was asked on the stand who offered to help him move drugs through Honduras, he <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/26/honduras-election-pacheco-security-minister-is-running-drugs-according-to-court-testimony/\">named</a> Hernández’s current minister of security, Julian Pacheco, a longtime ally of the U.S. military and graduate of the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia. The informant also said it was Lobo’s son who had introduced him to Pacheco.</p>\n<p>Olanchanos aren’t fooled: They know the leaders of the drug game are the same corrupt networks. The streets may be calmer now, but they still rule, and they make their presence known.</p>\n<p>Olanchanos recognize the traces of the drug networks because they’re “out of place,” fuera de lugar<em>.</em> For instance: the imported German beers in the dilapidated refrigerators of corner stores across Catacamas, catering to expensive tastes not from around there. The mayor’s office in Concordia, built like a castle, against which lean the homes of residents, clay block shacks. Sightings of limousines that appear suddenly and meander dirt roads. Elegiac poetry books, sold in gas stations around Juticalpa, honoring former Mayor Ramón Sarmiento, arrested for illegal weapons possession.</p>\n<p>Another trace of their presence is large enough to be seen from space.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Clearcut-near-tiro-RPBR--1513956985.jpg\"><img alt=\"Narcodeforestation in the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve on Aug. 2, 2015.\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Clearcut-near-tiro-RPBR--1513956985-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-163760\"></a>\n<p>Narcodeforestation in the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, in the Honduran province of Olancho, on Aug. 2, 2015.</p>\n<p>Photo: Narcodeforestation scientist tea</p></div><br>\n<u>In the summer</u> of 2015, a group of U.S. scientists met in a classroom at the University of Arizona. They have been studying a trend they call <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6170/489\">narco-deforestation</a>: trees razed because of the drug trade. Suddenly, one scientist gasped and swiveled his computer screen so the rest could see. A Honduran colleague had uploaded to Facebook a satellite image of the middle of a preserved rainforest that traverses Olancho, the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve. The image was a cemetery of hacked trees. The extent of the carnage was almost certainly too big and had happened too fast to be funded by anything other than drugs.\n<p>Mark Bonta, a geographer at Penn State Altoona, is one of the scientists and earlier that summer, he was in a truck jostling along a dirt path into the heart of the reserve. Three other people rode with him: Oscar, a teacher and lawyer from Olancho, and José, a farmer-cum-environmentalist in Olancho. I sat beside José. For a while, the lowland rainforest appeared just as a 1.3 million-acre plot of federally protected land ought to: The song of tropical birds buoyed off leafy, wet, dense green. But then we rolled into blight. Recently felled trees smoldered, a gray graveyard extending to the horizon. This is what’s called the “colonization front,” the outer edge of a patch of deforestation.</p>\n<p>In the age of the American drug war, Olancho’s traditional trades — logging, cattle-ranching, mining — double as vehicles for laundering money and moving drugs. They all lead to deforestation. The logging-to-cattle cycle is particularly useful: Use drug profits to chop trees, grow grass, buy cows, and every step of the process is like a magic wand that transforms bad money into good — and yields a return on the investment. When it’s time to physically move drugs out of the region, send a semi-truck full of those products across the border. Cocaine has been found in many exported Honduran products, including logs, cattle, tomato paste, and coconuts.</p>\n<p>That day, as we drove on, we passed pastures of long-ago deforested land, now grassy hills flecked with shining cattle. The scene wouldn’t look out of place in Kentucky, but this is a rainforest preserve.</p>\n<p>We took a pitstop when the dirt path hit a patch of houses. A man there told us he worked providing transport, driving his truck up and down the road. He said that the “secreto a voces,” the spoken secret, is that the cattle farms around here are mostly owned by narcos. He said that just across the Coco River that divides Honduras from Nicaragua, the farthest point his work takes him, there are large ranches owned by Colombian traffickers. We heard similar rumors that day about multiple other regions of the country: Narco operations, sometimes in collaboration with international outfits and sometimes under homegrown capos, are to blame for the broken trees.</p>\n<p>In fact, satellite images produced by the scientists show active deforestation of lowland rainforest in five Honduran national parks, including the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, a growing colonization front that spans the country like a horizontal belt. Not all this deforestation is narco-related. After all, logging and ranching are historic trades in the region. The drug connection is a scientific hypothesis based on satellite images of unusually rapid land-use change, located in well-known trafficking routes, triangulated with the testimonies of people on the ground and reports from organizations that follow the tides of corruption.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">In the age of the American drug war, Olancho’s traditional trades — logging, cattle-ranching, mining — double as vehicles for laundering money and moving drugs.</blockquote>\n<p>We piled back into the truck, and along the way we offer rides to various local residents we found walking along the edge of the road. One passenger told us his nephew, a mechanic, took a job with a company in the Río Sico area of the Biosphere Reserve, in La Mosquitia territory. (La Mosquitia is northeast of Olancho, the site of an infamous DEA-involved <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-dea-says-it-came-under-fire-during-a-deadly-drug-raid-its-own-video-suggests-otherwise\">massacre</a>.) The man said his nephew arrived to discover his new employer was a mineral mine owned by Colombian narcos. The nephew is only occasionally allowed to return home to bring his earnings to his family, the passenger said.</p>\n<p>He is one of many people unwittingly recruited into the service of traffickers, said Migdonia Ayestas, the coordinator of a project that collects and analyzes data on violence, based at the National Autonomous University of Honduras or UNAH. It’s common to be hired for illicit duties masked as a normal profession, said Ayestas, and hard to extricate yourself from the situation: As soon as you know it’s a narco operation, you know too much. Leaving the job means going rogue. Drug money so thoroughly permeates everything that when Ayestas’s project was awarded a grant from the government of Spain to investigate campaign finances in 2014, the university had to give the money back, she said in an interview in her campus office. “We couldn’t find anyone willing to take the job. People say all the time, ‘Where did that political campaign come up with so much money?’ We wanted a scientific answer to that question,” she said. “We couldn’t because no one dared do it.”</p>\n<p>Edmundo Orellana, who has served as the Honduran public prosecutor, the minister of defense, and delegate to the United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.hondurastierralibre.com/2015/10/economia-hondurena-se-ha-sostenido-por.html\">has said</a> that the Honduran economy runs on money laundering. In a phone interview, he said he began to notice legitimate industry used to launder illicit funds in the 1990s when he was public prosecutor. Moguls and politicians were “animated by how easy it was to make money, but also by the security that the justice system wasn’t going to catch up with them.” And then came the drug war. “Honduras’s current situation, in which it has been a victim of drug trafficking and organized crime in general, is the fault of the United States,” he said, continuing that it is U.S. strategy that pushed the drug war into Central America. “What the U.S. is doing from its perspective is good, it’s right. But from Hondurans’ perspective, the problem has become ours.”</p>\n<p>Orellana also points to high-level local control of the drug trade. To illustrate, he uses the case of the Cachiros cartel. “When someone at the U.S. Department of Justice called someone in the Honduran government [in 2015] to request the capture and extradition of the Cachiros,” Orellana said, the U.S. mentioned a particular concern: The cartel owned a construction company that was among the Honduran government’s <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/contracts-awarded-honduran-drug-caln-illustrate-cyclical-corruption/\">favored contractors</a> for paving highways.</p>\n<p>Hernández, who has held office since 2014, is uncomfortably close to drug trafficking — in terms of the sheer volume that has occurred on his watch and because of the alleged narcos among his own people. Other criticisms include his attempts to bring all branches of the government under his control, from the Supreme Court to the public prosecutor, to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the military police force. Then there’s the fact that Honduras has become, under him, the <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/honduras-deadliest-country-world-environmental-activism/\">deadliest</a> place in the world for environmentalists. That reality is especially evident in the unsolved murder of Berta Cáceres, but is widespread beyond her case.</p>\n<p>When environmentalists protect natural resources, they threaten the profit of those who’ve monopolized land and water — some of whom are not only politically powerful but are also documented traffickers. An example is the late Miguel Facussé, who was among the wealthiest businesspeople in Central America. His company Dinant was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/mar/08/farmers-sue-world-bank-lending-arm-ifc-over-alleged-violence-in-honduras\">backed</a> in the past by the U.N. and now by the World Bank. Facussé was <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04TEGUCIGALPA672_a.html\">suspected</a> of drug trafficking by the U.S. government, and Dinant is still the owner of <a href=\"http://www.dinant.com/index.php/en/sala-de-prensa/comunicados/374-honduras-largest-company-slowly-rebuilds-its-global-reputation\">thousands</a> of acres of palm oil plantations on disputed land. While defending that land, more than 100 farm workers have been killed by Facussé’s private security forces working in concert with the Honduran military, which illustrates another piece of the puzzle. When environmentalists resist such characters, they often face retaliation from state security forces acting at the landowners’ behest, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/28/berta-caceres-honduras-military-intelligence-us-trained-special-forces\">happened</a> with Cáceres. The Honduran police and military have been <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/03/the-president-of-honduras-is-deploying-u-s-trained-forces-against-election-protesters/\">trained </a>by the U.S., Israel, and Colombia, funded by millions of U.S. dollars annually.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Honduras-military-1513956608.jpg\"><img alt=\"Honduran military police stand guard next to supporters of opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla as they hold a protest march on December 3, 2017 in Tegucigalpa, despite the state of emergency and a 10-day curfew imposed by the government to stop violent demonstrations triggered by claims of presidential election fraud.

One of the more quirky examples of such knowledge was a State Department <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04TEGUCIGALPA2223_a.html\">cable</a> written in Tegucigalpa about U.S. fast food franchises in Honduras. The cable’s author remarked that the same handful of families owns the rights to brands like McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Pepsi, and benefits from “dubious” tax breaks awarded them by a friendly Congress with seemingly no legal explanation, except the flimsy argument that gringo chains bring tourism. (Has a gringo ever traveled to Tegucigalpa to eat a Big Mac?) Another cable, written after Mel Zelaya was elected president, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/05TEGUCIGALPA2445_a.html\">noted</a> that Zelaya’s father-in-law is a prominent lawyer who, at the time, counted among his clients some people who are nominally Zelaya’s political enemies, prominent National Party members. One of the clients was Facussé, the palm baron. The cable also noted that Zelaya’s father owned the Olancho farm that was the site of the 1975 massacre of land reform advocates.\n<p>Yet successive U.S. administrations have chosen to cultivate that oligarchy, especially the faction from the political right. Enter President Juan Orlando Hernández, described in a State Department <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10TEGUCIGALPA58_a.html\">cable</a> as someone who has “consistently supported U.S. interests.” Hernández earned a master’s degree in public administration at the State University of New York at Albany and has a brother who had received extensive care at U.S. army hospitals after being injured in a military parachuting accident.</p>\n<p>Now Hernández and his National Party are roundly and globally scrutinized for mounting evidence of electoral fraud. Yet two days after the election, the U.S. State Department <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-election-usa-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-document-certifies-honduras-as-supporting-rights-amid-vote-crisis-idUSKBN1DY2K7\">certified</a> Honduras as a country that fights corruption and respects human rights and thus, can receive millions of dollars in U.S. aid. On December 2, the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa <a href=\"https://hn.usembassy.gov/embassy-statement-honduran-electoral-process/\">announced</a> it was “pleased” with the ballot recount, saying it “maximizes citizen participation and transparency.” Three days later, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy led a small chorus of congressional rebuttal: “Those of us who care about Central America have watched the election for Honduras’ next president with increasing alarm,” <a href=\"https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-statement-on-the-election-in-honduras\">he wrote</a>, citing “a process so lacking in transparency” with “too much suspicion of fraud.” Of the U.S. Embassy’s “troubling” role in the crisis, the senator wrote, “I hope it is not a new standard.”</p>\n<p>In fact, it appears to be an old standard, if not a tradition.</p>\n<p><span>On December 17, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal officially crowned Hernández president-elect. That night, the delegation of election observers from the Organization of American States recommended the results be scrapped and that a new election be held. Despite increasing calls from U.S. senators to support the OAS verdict, on December 20 a senior State Department official </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-election-usa/u-s-follows-mexico-in-backing-disputed-honduran-vote-result-idUSKBN1EE2AR\"><span>said</span></a><span> that unless presented with additional evidence of fraud, the U.S. government has “not seen anything that alters the final result.” Two days later, the State Department sealed Honduras’ fate, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAmbHonduras\">congratulating</a><span> President Hernández on his victory, prescribing a “robust national dialogue” to “heal the political divide,” and advising those who claim fraud to recur to Honduran law. The Department ended its statement by calling upon Hondurans to refrain from violence.</span></p>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/23/honduras-election-fraud-drugs-jose-orlando-hernandez/#_ftnref1\"></a></p>\n<p>Top photo: Residents get away from clashes between riot police and supporters of opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla, during protests in Tegucigalpa, on December 18, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/23/honduras-election-fraud-drugs-jose-orlando-hernandez/\">The Election Fraud in Honduras Follows Decades of Corruption Funded By the U.S. War on Drugs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Newly elected state Delegate Lee Carter, a Democratic Socialist, says enough is enough, warning that Northam may be alienating the Democrats who put him in office.</p>\n<p>Northam told the Washington Post last weekend that he will not try to force a vote on expanding Medicaid — an issue that was central to his campaign — in the legislature. Responding to criticisms, the governor-elect’s spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/progressives-riled-up-by-northams-comments-on-medicaid-bipartisanship/2017/12/18/94dd2684-e42e-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.8dbebecc0b09\">told</a> the Washington Post that Northam still wants to expand the program. Northam also renewed his commitment to Medicaid expansion on social media following the outcry.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have and will continue to advocate for Medicaid expansion because it is a no-brainer for Virginia families, our budget, and our economy. We can also come together on smart policy choices that will allow us to deliver better care at lower cost.</p>\n<p>— Ralph Northam (@RalphNortham) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RalphNortham/status/942448928250826755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 17, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, it remains unclear whether Northam will ask the legislature for a straight up or down vote on the measure or instead try to work out a compromise that may include reforms that could actually reduce Medicaid eligibility for some people.</p>\n<p>Northam will enter office in January with a slate of newly elected Democrats, including Carter — a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lee-carter-delegate-democratic-socialist_us_5a074548e4b05673aa5997fd\">30-year-old marine veteran</a> who toppled the Republican House whip in the November election.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to recognize that there are <a href=\"http://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org/2017/07/17/building-opportunity-health-care/\">750,000 Virginians</a> with no health insurance whatsoever. So when we’re talking about the Medicaid expansion — there’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/08/virginia-expands-health-coverage-for-25000-medicaid-expansion-stalled.html\">370,000 people who are eligible</a> under the federal rules,” Carter said in an interview with The Intercept. “So a clean Medicaid expansion only covers half of those people. A clean Medicaid expansion <em>is</em> the compromise. That’s where I’m coming from, that’s what I hope he’d be advocating for. I don’t think his comments were indicative of that.”</p>\n<p>Carter himself has not had health insurance for nearly a year, as purchasing coverage through the health care marketplace can be cost-prohibitive. He thought about how that might change on the night he won his election, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lee-carter-delegate-democratic-socialist_us_5a074548e4b05673aa5997fd\">reportedly telling his</a> wife, “You know what I won? Health insurance.”</p>\n<p>Virginia is one of a handful of states that has yet to utilize the Affordable Care Act’s provision to expand Medicaid access. Republicans in the state legislature have been blocking the move, but the Democratic wave in November makes the body nearly evenly split. Northam would only have to swing a handful of Republicans in order to fully expand the program.</p>\n<p>As a candidate, Northam made expanding Medicaid a <a href=\"https://pilotonline.com/opinion/columnist/guest/ralph-northam-do-the-right-thing-expand-medicaid/article_43f3ffbf-5211-546a-b026-808d7467e606.html\">cornerstone</a> of his bid for governor. He highlighted that promise in campaign commercials aired throughout the state, a fact that was not lost on his supporters:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RalphNortham?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RalphNortham</a> calling anyone who thinks Virginia shouldn't expand Medicaid &quot;needs their head examined&quot; – today he walked back this promise. <a href=\"https://t.co/oTAHKF6kuw\">pic.twitter.com/oTAHKF6kuw</a></p>\n<p>— People For Bernie (@People4Bernie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/942434166875963393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 17, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>But he wavered on that promise in his recent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gov-elect-northam-rode-a-democratic-wave-but-now-hes-preaching-bipartisanship/2017/12/16/689e1074-e1b3-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html?utm_term=.34b00e90377e\">interview</a> with the Washington Post. Summarizing his view, the paper wrote, “Northam said he has no plans to try to force Republicans to accept a broad expansion of Medicaid. Instead, he has begun talks with lawmakers in both parties about overhauling the state’s Medicaid system to expand access to health care while better defining eligibility to control costs.” Later in the interview, Northam said he consulted with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and that he plans to instead push for a bipartisan solution that could involve, among other things, encouraging those who do not currently work to work. “I want people to have skin in the game. I want to incentivize people to really have good health,” he said.</p>\n<p>Carter believes voters will punish Democrats if the party does not make progress on expanding health care coverage.</p>\n<p>“There was a clear mandate from the voters on health care. I mean it was completely unambiguous,” he said. “750,000 Virginians with no health insurance whatsoever. There’s a million or two million more who have health insurance but can’t afford their deductible. Something has got to change on health care. It’s got to change in a dramatic matter. And if we don’t deliver on that, in two years there’s gonna be hell to pay.”</p>\n<p>Former Virginia Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello, who unsuccessfully challenged Northam for the Democratic nomination earlier this year, pointed out on Twitter that the Medicaid promise was a big part of the Democrats’ success last month:</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Blocking Medicaid expansion was a major reason so many Republicans lost their House seats in VA this year. Full expansion should be bi-partisan, and every legislator in Richmond should have to cast a public vote before 2019 on a policy that is morally right &amp; good for VA economy.</p>\n<p>— Tom Perriello (@tomperriello) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomperriello/status/942436973419159557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 17, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, an NBC exit poll found that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/health-care-played-big-role-in-democratic-win-in-virginia-poll.html\">37 percent</a> of Virginia voters said health care was the most important issue to them. University of Maryland polling released earlier this year found that <a href=\"http://www.publicconsultation.org/federal-budget/large-majority-of-voters-in-states-without-medicaid-expansion-favor-it/\">69 percent</a> of Virginians supported Medicaid expansion.</p>\n<p>Northam has also made getting a full Medicaid expansion more difficult by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/northam-names-democrat-from-lynchburg-as-secretary-of-transportation/2017/12/14/d111ce9e-e054-11e7-bbd0-9dfb2e37492a_story.html?utm_term=.3200acd3ad2c\">so-far not appointing</a> Republicans from the legislature into his administration. Doing so would trigger special elections that could throw control of the legislature to the Democrats instead.</p>\n<p>Carter expressed some disappointment in the governor-elect’s move.</p>\n<p>“It certainly would’ve made it easier to achieve our legislative priorities if he had done that,” Carter said of appointing a Republican to a cabinet position. “It’s not necessarily the decision I would have made, but it wasn’t the decision for me to make.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Lee Carter, a socialist who won a seat during this year’s elections in the Virginia House of Delegates for the 50th District, poses on November 9, 2017 in Manassas, Virginia.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/23/virginias-new-socialist-lawmaker-a-clean-medicaid-expansion-is-the-compromise/\">Virginia’s New Socialist Lawmaker: “A Clean Medicaid Expansion Is the Compromise”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>On Wednesday, a</u> federal judge in Nevada declared a mistrial in the prosecution of Cliven Bundy, his sons Ryan and Ammon, and family supporter Ryan Payne, over charges related to their armed standoff with federal officials in 2014. The government had failed to disclose pertinent evidence to defense lawyers, including FBI reports that said the Bundy family wasn’t dangerous — the latest in a series of embarrassing blunders and egregious misconduct by federal agents and prosecutors.</p>\n<p>After racking up more than $1 million in fees for his cattle to graze on federal lands, Cliven Bundy had refused to pay. In April 2014, the Bureau of Land Management, with the help of so-called contract cowboys, tried to impound Bundy’s cattle. Cliven and his sons took up arms and were soon joined by dozens of armed supporters who had heard about their apparent plight through the social media and right-wing media. Federal agents backed down, delivering what appeared to a victory to Bundy and his supporters.</p>\n<p>But the government wasn’t finished. Months after the standoff, the FBI set up a front company, Longbow Productions, and supposed employees portrayed themselves as documentary filmmakers sympathetic to the Bundy family and their supporters. The FBI even had a working title for their fake documentary: “<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/05/16/the-bizarre-story-behind-the-fbis-fake-documentary-about-the-bundy-family/\">America Reloaded</a>.” But the government’s investigation seemed doomed from the start.</p>\n<p>FBI agents posing as documentary filmmakers traveled to a hotel in Las Vegas in 2015 to interview Ryan Bundy. Sitting in a hotel chair as he waited to be interviewed by the fake filmmakers, Ryan seemed to grow wise to the government’s cover. “Is this just a mole project to garner information that will then be given to the feds?” Ryan asked the undercover agents.</p>\n<p>“I want a truthful documentary,” answered Charles Johnson, the undercover FBI agent who was posing as the lead filmmaker.</p>\n<p>Ryan’s suspicion about the undercover FBI operation was in hindsight a sign that the federal government’s case against the Bundy family and their supporters was headed off the rails.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department and defense lawyers have until December 29 to file briefs arguing whether the judge should allow a new trial against Bundy, his sons, and Payne. Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a review of the case.</p>\n<p>But for all the apparent zeal with which the U.S. government went after the Bundy family and their supporters, government agents and prosecutors seemed to succeed most in lending support to the various conspiracies the Bundy family and their supporters believed to be true — that a land-hungry, out-of-control federal government was victimizing Western ranchers.<br>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Clive-bundy-ranch-1513959590.jpg\"><img alt=\"FILE - In this Jan. 27, 2016, file photo, rancher Cliven Bundy stands along the road near his ranch in Bunkerville, Nev.

But the FBI wasn’t willing to let the Bundy family and their supporters stand victorious.</p>\n<p>Instead, FBI agents in the Las Vegas field office called in Johnson to help determine if anyone had violated federal law during the armed standoff. Johnson and the Las Vegas FBI settled on <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/05/16/the-bizarre-story-behind-the-fbis-fake-documentary-about-the-bundy-family/\">a controversial plan to pose as documentary filmmakers</a>. While FBI Director James Comey had described this practice of impersonating journalists as “lawful and, in a rare case, appropriate,” the scale of the fake Bundy documentary was the largest of any publicly disclosed involving the use of a journalistic cover.</p>\n<p>Despite spending eight months and traveling to five states to interview people who were there for the standoff at the Bundy ranch, Johnson and his undercover FBI team never uncovered anything incriminating against Bundy and his sons. In fact, the best evidence they filmed came from a former FBI informant and Arizona militiaman, Greg Burleson, who said he had hoped for violence at the standoff.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people say, ‘Thank God it wasn’t bloody,’” Burleson told fake filmmakers. “I’m saying, ‘Damn, I’m disappointed.’” He also stated: “I was hellbent on killing federal agents that had turned their back on we the people.”</p>\n<p>But Burleson was alone in this. The other people the FBI film crew interviewed on camera, including the Bundy patriarch and his sons, expressed relief that no one was hurt during the standoff.</p>\n<p>Less than a year after fake documentary operation ceased, Johnson, the undercover agent, continued to pose as a journalist for FBI operations. In March 15, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/05/16/how-an-undercover-fbi-agent-ended-up-in-jail-after-pretending-to-be-a-journalist/\">Johnson was arrested by police in Glendale, Colorado,</a> on a charge that he was acting as a private investigator without a license. Appearing to be investigating a city land deal, Johnson had told local police he was doing research for a journalist he would not name. Local prosecutors dropped the indictment after receiving a letter from the FBI asking them not to prosecute.<br>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Lavoy-funeral-Bundy-1513958840.jpg\"><img alt=\"KANAB, UT - FEBRUARY 5: People line the road as a horse honor guard escorts the hurst after the funeral of rancher Robert &quot;LaVoy&quot; Finicum on February 5, 2016 in Kanab, Utah.

Roughly a year and a half after the showdown in the desert, the men led the armed takeover and occupation of a wildlife refuge in Oregon. Officially, the Bundys said, they were standing in solidarity with a local ranching family that had faced unlawful persecution by the state; the justification would be called into question in the ensuing weeks, as it became increasingly clear that local support for the occupation, including from the family in question, was far from unanimous.</p>\n<p>The Oregon standoff stretched on for weeks, with the threat of violence lingering. While a Waco-like tragedy was averted, the confrontation was not without bloodshed. On January 26, 2016, Roger “LaVoy” Finicum, a 54-year-old rancher from Arizona, was shot dead in a snowbank along a remote highway outside the refuge. Finicum had been one of the drivers in a two-vehicle convoy intercepted by Oregon State Police and the FBI as the occupiers attempted to make their way to a nearby town. Finicum led authorities on a brief chase before plowing his vehicle into a snowbank in order to avoid a roadblock; his final moments were captured on video from multiple angles, including an FBI <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGxDWKrjPQ\">surveillance aircraft</a> monitoring the scene from above and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEswP_HSFV4\">cellphone footage</a> shot from inside his vehicle.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement said Finicum was killed because he had reached for a handgun later found in his jacket — the FBI footage shows Finicum alternating between throwing his hands in the air and reaching for areas around his torso — while Bundy supporters argued the three bullets in his back and the lack of a gun in his hand were evidence of state-sanctioned murder. Complicating matters further, the shooting produced a curious piece of evidence: a bullet-hole in the roof of the vehicle Finicum was driving.</p>\n<p>The cellphone footage captured from inside the vehicle <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH4PInHFfOc\">shows</a> the round was fired just as Finicum stepped out to face law enforcement. Local law enforcement had accounted for the shots they had fired. Initially, the five FBI agents assigned to the highway intercept operation said none of them had opened fire that day, but <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/03/bullet_casings_disappear_from.html\">suspicions</a> mounted when law enforcement sources, police reports, and the FBI’s own footage indicated that two bullet casings had in fact been removed from the scene by FBI agents prior to the arrival of local investigators.</p>\n<p>Local authorities found themselves at odds with their federal counterparts. The Department of Justice inspector general opened an investigation, and a year later, a member of the FBI’s elite Hostage Rescue Team was <a href=\"http://beta.latimes.com/nation/la-na-fbi-oregon-shooting-20170628-story.html\">indicted</a> for taking the shots at Finicum and then lying about it to state and federal investigators. The agent, W. Joseph Astarita, has pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Eric-Parker-1513897674.jpg\"><img alt=\"Eric Parker from central Idaho stands watch on a bridge with his weapon as protesters gather by the Bureau of Land Management's base camp, where cattle that were seized from rancher Cliven Bundy are being held, near Bunkerville, Nevada April 12, 2014. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Saturday said it had called off an effort to round up Bundy's herd of cattle that it had said were being illegally grazed in southern Nevada, citing concerns about safety.

From Nevada to Oregon, the actions of federal officials and agencies have repeatedly resulted in self-sabotage and, ironically, offered a degree a legitimacy to theories held by the Bundy family’s most eccentric supporters. In other words, these actions have not only the hurt the state’s efforts at securing prosecutions, but they have also fueled longstanding perceptions among the right-wing groups and militias that the federal government is an underhanded institution that will stop at nothing to crush the little guy and cover up its own misdeeds.</p>\n<p>From the beginning, federal prosecutors have sought to prove a grand conspiracy undergirded the initial 2014 standoff and that the Bundys themselves were involved in setting those events in motion. Unfortunately for the government, the state’s own evidence has failed to meet that mark.</p>\n<p>In August, jurors <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/bundy-blm/2-men-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-bunkerville-standoff-case/\">acquitted</a> one of the most prominent defendants in the case, Eric Parker, of several counts for his involvement in the standoff. A photo of Parker lying prone on highway overpass, his rifle trained on the wash below, where Bundy protesters were facing off against BLM agents, became a symbol of the clash that day. Parker had traveled to Nevada with his friend, Scott Drexler, who was also acquitted, to join in the demonstrations. In his conversations with the FBI’s fake documentary team, Parker had said that his motivation for attending the protest was to take a stand against police brutality — a reference to a viral video of one of the Bundy brothers being tased by BLM agents — and that he carried a weapon in hopes of providing a check against the militarized law enforcement on hand in Bunkerville. In addition to Parker and Drexler, jurors also acquitted standoff participants Ricky Lovelien and Steven Stewart in August.</p>\n<p>To date, the heaviest punishment resulting from the Nevada standoff was levied against Burleson, the Arizona militia member and former FBI informant. In conversations with the FBI film crew, Burleson made a series of self-incriminating boasts about his reasons for joining the standoff as he drank alcohol provided by the undercover agents. Burleson claimed that he was ready, willing, and eager to kill members of law enforcement. Whether he had the capacity for such violence is unclear; the 53-year-old is legally blind, suffers from serious health issues, and now uses a wheelchair for transportation. He was <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/bundy-blm/bundy-supporter-burleson-sentenced-to-68-years-in-prison/\">sentenced</a> to more than 68 years in federal prison.</p>\n<p>Most of the government’s convictions have come from guilty pleas from nine supporters in Oregon and two others in Nevada. They include Gerald DeLemus, a co-chair of a veterans’ group with the Donald Trump presidential campaign who was sentenced to seven years in prison.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Bundy-FBI-BLM-1513960457.jpg\"><img alt=\"The FBI are running operations out of the BLM Single Engine Air Tanker base next to Burns Municipal Airport in Ore., pictured on January 10, 2016.

During his two years and 10 months examining the Bundy case, which he described as “the largest and most expansive and important investigation ever within the Department of Interior,” Wooten said he observed “a widespread pattern of bad judgment, lack of discipline, incredible bias, unprofessionalism and misconduct, as well as likely policy, ethical, and legal violations among senior and supervisory staff at the BLM’s Office of Law Enforcement and Security.” Wooten added that the actions of BLM officials in the Bundy case “made a mockery of our position of special trust and confidence, portrayed extreme professional bias, adversely affected our agency’s mission and likely the trial regarding Cliven Bundy and his alleged co-conspirators and ignored the letter and intent of the law.”</p>\n<p>In addition to a fostering a “carnival atmosphere,” in which the Bundy defendants, their supporters, and Mormons in general were routinely ridiculed (the Bundys are Mormon), Wooten accused Dan Love, the lead BLM agent, of doing everything in his power to push the Bundy investigation in his preferred direction. “It is my assessment and the investigation showed that the 2014 Gold Butte Trespass Cattle Impound was in part a punitive and ego driven expedition by a Senior BLM Law Enforcement Supervisor,” he said, adding that Love sought to “command the most intrusive, oppressive, large scale and militaristic trespass cattle impound possible.” Wooten specifically accused senior BLM officials in Nevada of failing to keep the U.S. attorney’s office up to date “on substantive and exculpatory case findings and unacceptable bias indications.” When he “personally informed” acting U.S. Attorney Steven Myhre and the FBI of the issues, Wooten said, his supervisor “deceptively acted ignorant and surprised.”</p>\n<p>“When I asked Mr. Myhre if the former BLM (Special Agent in Charge’s) statements like ‘Go out there and kick Cliven Bundy in the mouth (or teeth) and take his cattle’ … would be exculpatory or if we would have to inform the defense counsel, he said something like, ‘We do now,’ or ‘It is now,’” Wooten said.</p>\n<p>Wooten lost his job in Nevada — a result, he believes, of continually raising concerns regarding the professionalism of the Bundy investigation — and was assigned to a post in Idaho. He has since filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint, and the case is now being investigated. In closing his memo, Wooten said his complaints were not a result of sympathy for the Bundys or their supporters; he believes they broke laws during the confrontation at the wash. Instead, he argued, they stemmed from responsibilities incumbent on professional law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p>“As a law enforcement officer, I can’t allow injustices and cover-ups to go unreported or half-truths and skewed narratives to go unopposed,” he said. “I have learned that when conduct of this sort isn’t corrected, then by default it is condoned, and it becomes unofficial policy.”</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Bundy-family-trial-1513897104.jpg\"><img alt=\"From left, Ryan Payne, Jeanette Finicum, widow of Robert &quot;LaVoy&quot; Finicum, Ryan Bundy, Angela Bundy, wife of Ryan Bundy and Jamie Bundy, daughter of Ryan Bundy, walk out of a federal courthouse Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2017, in Las Vegas.

The Bundys’s legal team had argued that the build-up of equipment and personnel was part of the reason their co-defendant Ryan Payne put out a public call for support in the run-up to the standoff, and made formal requests for information on the technology set up around the property. Though the U.S. attorney’s office apparently knew about the existence of the surveillance equipment, it nonetheless dismissed the motion as “fantastical” and part of a “fishing expedition.”</p>\n<p>Navarro also pointed to the existence of nearly 500 pages of internal BLM documents withheld from the defense team regarding Love, the BLM special agent in charge during the Bundy affair.</p>\n<p>Two months before the trial of Cliven Bundy, his sons, and Payne was to begin, <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/blm-agent-accused-of-taking-valuable-stones-held-as-evidence/\">BLM fired Love</a> after internal inquiries substantiated a host of misconduct, including deleting BLM emails that then-Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz had requested; manipulating a job search so that his friend would benefit; and using his BLM position to acquire tickets to the Burning Man festival, where he was overseeing security and had demanded the construction of a $1 million compound with <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2015/06/26/blm-wants-vip-compound-burning-man/29318493/\">24-hour access to ice cream</a>. In addition, BLM determined that Love took valuable stones known as “Moqui marbles” — which were being held as evidence in a case — and handed them out “like candy” to colleagues and a contractor.</p>\n<p>While so far unable to convict Cliven Bundy, U.S. prosecutors and investigators have at least proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the government really was out to get him.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Flanked by armed supporters, rancher Cliven Bundy speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada on April 2014.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/cliven-bundy-case-ranch-standoff-fbi/\">How the Government Botched the Case Against Cliven Bundy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>College basketball and</u> football players are being fleeced. As they put their bodies on the line day in and day out — often suffering catastrophic injuries and brain-damaging concussions — the NCAA and various regional sports leagues squeeze every cent out of these “amateur” student-athletes’ labor, and make billions of dollars off it. The players, though, are penalized for selling autographs or making money off their social media or YouTube accounts.</p>\n<p>Where I’m from, we call that a hustle. It’s a scam. And one man, LaVar Ball, the brash basketball dad, has proposed a new professional sports league for standout high school basketball stars that could upend it all – either because it ends up working or because it forces the NCAA racket to finally change its ways.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Ball announced his intentions to start the<a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2750309-lavar-ball-to-start-big-baller-brand-league-for-players-who-skip-college\"> Junior Basketball Association</a> or JBA. A league with 10 teams of eight young players each, salaries for each player would range from $3,000 to $10,000 per month. It’s a brilliant gambit. High school basketball is already so popular that some high school stars, including Ball’s own children, have hundreds of thousands — and sometimes millions — of followers on social media. Highlight videos regularly have millions of views on YouTube, and bootleg livestreams of competitive games featuring emerging stars regularly go viral.</p>\n<p>Because of an agreement between the NBA and the NCAA, high school athletes are no longer allowed to do what Kobe Bryant or LeBron James did and go pro straight out of high school. They must play a year of college or overseas basketball before they can be drafted. Only a tiny percentage of American high schoolers take the overseas route first. Instead, they are doing something that is now routinely called the “one and done.” This is when high school stars go to college where they attend for a year – playing basketball – then declare themselves eligible for the NBA draft.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Unlike semi-pro athletes, students aren’t paid a dime.</blockquote>\n<p>The top universities are fully aware that these star athletes have no intention of staying. These educational institutions — and granted tax protections because of that designation — completely violate their mission when signing such athletes and running such programs. In essence, top programs are being treated like semi-pro leagues. Players are practicing five times a week, traveling and playing 30 to 40 games in just a few months, conducting interviews, attending charity events, all while being expected to somehow maintain some type of academic integrity. Unlike semi-pro athletes, however, students aren’t paid a dime; they can’t even collect money in any way connected to their work on the court.</p>\n<p>A few decades ago, the hustle was a bit easier to swallow. Brands and corporations had hardly gotten in on the act, coaches were well-paid but not yet filthy rich, and TV contracts weren’t anything like they are now.</p>\n<p>Today,<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/19019077/highest-paid-us-employees-dominated-college-football-college-basketball-coaches\"> in 39 different states</a>, college sports coaches, not governors or college presidents, are the highest-paid public employees. In most states, it’s not even close. In Michigan and Kentucky, states often said to have struggling economies, college coaches are being paid over $7 million per year by the government. In Kentucky, in contrast, Gov. Matt Bevin made just about $140,000 last year. Now the argument could easily be made that those coaches lead teams that generate hundreds of millions of dollars for their universities. Let’s agree on that. These coaches also make millions of dollars in lucrative endorsement deals, ranging from long-term contracts with major brands to commercial deals with local car dealerships.</p>\n<p>And that doesn’t even count the money that sports bring to the NCAA itself. The collegiate sports authority <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2016/4/12/11415764/ncaa-tournament-tv-broadcast-rights-money-payout-cbs-turner\">just signed an $8.8 billion extension with CBS</a> to broadcast the NCAA tournament every March. The deal was already worth $10.8 billion and was scheduled to run through 2024, but the new arrangement extends the contract through 2032. Consider this: Most of the players who will be in that tournament in 2032 aren’t even in kindergarten yet.</p>\n<p>UCLA — where Ball’s oldest son, Lonzo, played for a year before going pro — <a href=\"http://beta.latimes.com/sports/ucla/la-sp-0525-ucla-under-armour-20160525-snap-story.html\">just signed a record $280 million contract with Under Armour</a>, the largest shoe and sports apparel deal in college sports history. As a result, players must wear one brand and one brand only throughout their time on the court. Often, teams are literally selling jerseys and gear with the team numbers of the most popular players on them. Teams also sign endorsement deals dictating what players will drink during games, where they will go to the doctor, what airline they will travel on, and so much more.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Lonzo-ball-ucla-1513962033.jpg\"><img alt=\"TUCSON, AZ - FEBRUARY 25:  Lonzo Ball #2 of the UCLA Bruins handles the ball during the second half of the college basketball game against the Arizona Wildcats at McKale Center on February 25, 2017 in Tucson, Arizona.

Those are the facts.\n<p>But if the athletes who are generating these funds even accidentally cross the line to get a microscopic piece of the pie, they are routinely kicked off teams, put out of programs, blacklisted, and have their scholarships taken from them. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/31/college-football-player-loses-scholarship-youtube/\">It happened earlier this year</a> when Donald De La Haye, a kicker for the University of Central Florida’s football team, was deemed ineligible, then lost his scholarship, because of a small amount of money he made off his YouTube channel.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, Todd Gurley, now a running back and MVP candidate for the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, was <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/todd-gurley-autograph-scandal-2014-10\">suspended indefinitely</a> by the University of Georgia and the NCAA for receiving $400 to autograph some memorabilia. He was literally paid a measly <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/sports/college/source-ncaa-violation-may-end-gurley-season/mvDwfrv0axQXoM8D9x3EBN/\">$5 per autograph</a> and it ended his college career. The coach at Georgia makes $3.8 million per year as his base salary alone. These coaches live in mansions, drive luxury cars, and hang out with celebrities all over the world.</p>\n<p>For years, hungry college athletes were suspended for taking too much free food after burning thousands of calories in games and practices. In 2013, the NCAA <a href=\"https://www.athleticscholarships.net/2014/04/16/what-athletes-will-get-under-the-ncaas-new-food-rules.htm\">finally relaxed the rules on how much food players are allowed to eat</a> and how much free food they can accept. Yeah, really — that’s how wild this situation is.</p>\n<p>Any student on campus other than college athletes can sell their signatures, get free food from anyone and everyone, sign endorsement deals, and transfer to or from any college of their choice. NCAA student-athletes literally have fewer rights than students because they participate in a system that brings their schools more monetary benefits than many of the other students on campus.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">What Ball is aiming to do is what the NCAA should’ve done a long time ago: provide talented high school basketball stars with a way to play the game and make some money.</blockquote>\n<p>What Ball is aiming to do is what the NCAA should’ve done a long time ago: provide talented high school basketball stars with a way to play the game and make some money, while preparing for the NBA or leagues around the world.</p>\n<p>The argument that it’s too complicated to pay college athletes is hypocritical. Complex problems are routinely solved whenever those with the power feel motivated to do so. If colleges and universities don’t have the intellectual heft to crack the code on how to compensate players, maybe they shouldn’t be in the education business.</p>\n<p>Then there’s another issue: Is it not strange that young athletes in almost every predominantly white sport in America can go pro whenever they feel like it?</p>\n<p>High school tennis stars routinely go pro. Golfers, too. Even young baseball players can go pro without ever going to college. But a big-money market doesn’t exist for college athletics in those sports. Somehow, with basketball and football — dominated by black athletes, craved by millions of fans — youngsters must wait before they can go pro.</p>\n<p>So it makes sense that Ball, a black man who had rejected mainstream athletic apparel companies and started his own apparel company, would be the one to start a new league that blows the lid off the profit motive of college sports. These rules don’t exist to protect the players. They exist to provide colleges and corporations with billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Let the players who want to go pro do it. LaVar Ball is giving them a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Top photo: LaVar Ball, father of basketball players LiAngelo and Lonzo Ball and the owner of the Big Baller brand, attends a promotional event in Hong Kong, on Nov. 14, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/ncaa-junior-basketball-association-jba-lavar-ball/\">The NCAA Makes Billions, College Athletes Get Nothing.

According to attorneys and experts, lenders have ignored federal moratoria on foreclosures; placed notices of default in newspapers where they’re unlikely to be seen; sent files to homeowners in English rather than Spanish; and required residents to complete tasks that are borderline impossible without electrical power yet fully restored, among other abuses.</span></p>\n<p><span>The foreclosure horrors add to Puerto Rico’s Dickensian experience of late.

According to the New York Times, roughly one-third of 425,000 Puerto Rican homeowners have fallen behind on mortgage payments, and with jobs scarce after the hurricane, that number will likely grow. In fact, the economy of the island could collapse, as the Republican tax bill </span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/19/rubio-puerto-rico-governor-tax-fight-305996\"><span>imposes a 20 percent tax</span></a><span> on offshore exports — a category that includes Puerto Rican manufacturing.</span></p>\n<p>But if you think America learned lessons from the orgy of illegality that accompanied foreclosures in the United States after 2008, just look to Puerto Rico.

Adding two hurricanes to the equation makes the island’s residents ripe for a gargantuan ripoff. </span></p>\n<p><span>The foreclosure process in Puerto Rico resembles the judicial foreclosure process on the mainland. Lenders must follow federal guidelines on notifying borrowers of default and giving them an opportunity to cure debt. Then lenders can file a lawsuit for foreclosure. Judges are obligated to impose mandatory mediation, bringing borrowers and lenders to the table to work out a resolution. Only if that doesn’t work can lenders obtain a judgment and evict the homeowner.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, what sound like substantive protections for the borrower often don’t play out that way. “Many times they don’t know about their rights,” said Veronica Rivera, a coordinator for </span><a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://derechoatucasa.org/&prev=search\"><span>Derecho a tu Casa</span></a><span> or Right to Your House — a coalition of legal aid groups providing information and assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure. “They think that the bank would understand that they can’t pay because they lost their jobs. It surprises me sometimes how much trust people have in the banks.”</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, after Hurricane Maria, the federal government imposed a foreclosure moratorium on homes either backed by government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or those with Federal Housing Administration insurance. The FHA moratorium was </span><a href=\"http://www.tenaco.com/fha-extends-90-day-foreclosure-moratorium-properties-affected-hurricanes-harvey-irma-maria/\"><span>recently extended</span></a><span> to March 19, 2018, but it only applies to a sliver of loans. The Fannie and Freddie moratoria were set to expire on December 31, but the lenders this week made an extension until March 31. Banks and mortgage investors voluntarily offered three months of relief from payments, but homeowners had to call their lender to trigger it. “The banks said you have to call,” said Rivera. “We didn’t have internet for more than a month, didn’t have electricity, no communication. Many didn’t know.”</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“They think that the bank would understand that they can’t pay because they lost their jobs. It surprises me sometimes how much trust people have in the banks.”</blockquote>\n<p><span>Indeed, a </span><a href=\"http://hedgeclippers.org/report-no-53-private-equity-and-puerto-rico/\"><span>report</span></a><span> from the public interest firm Hedge Clippers shows that one company, Roosevelt Cayman Asset Co., has 289 active foreclosure cases in federal court and another 56 in local Puerto Rican courts. Federal courts, typically not a venue for foreclosure cases, are seen as faster than local courts, so offshore companies like Roosevelt lean heavily on them. </span></p>\n<p><span>Even after the hurricane, Roosevelt has filed motions for default judgment or eviction in the cases. The Intercept has reviewed lists of dozens of these motions. For example, Roosevelt filed a motion for eviction of Ernesto Santiago-Guzman and his family on October 11, three weeks after Maria hit, and a motion for default judgment against Elias Rivera-Rivera on October 12. U.S. District Judge Gustavo Gelpí denied that request because the case was only initiated a month before the hurricanes, “which trashed the entire island of Puerto Rico.” The judge postponed the case until March.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other judges have not been so kind. Docket entries show that Roosevelt secured a default judgment against Carlos Gonzalez-Luna’s property on October 23.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many of the loans Roosevelt acted on were purchased in a fire sale from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after the </span><a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/doral.html\"><span>2015 failure of Doral Bank</span></a><span>, a lender with a large portfolio of Puerto Rican mortgages. These loans were severely delinquent, some over two years. Federally insured distressed mortgages in Puerto Rico have become an </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/business/wall-street-paulson-puerto-rico-hedge-funds.html\"><span>appetizing target</span></a><span> for Wall Street land speculators seeking to make a quick buck and turn Puerto Rico into a playground for the rich. </span></p>\n<p><span>An unidentified Puerto Rico homeowner submitted a comment to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s </span><a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/\"><span>consumer complaint database</span></a><span>, claiming that Roosevelt is “not flexible and expressed that they just want to acquire the home to build their house portfolio.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Critics allege Roosevelt uses sleazy tactics to get default judgments. “Since the hurricane, they’ve sought to use service by publication, publishing names in the newspaper to serve the lawsuits. Who’s reading the newspaper these days?” asked Jim Baker, founder of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, who helped with the Hedge Clippers report. “Then they ask for default judgment because they served papers and the homeowners haven’t responded. In most cases, they’re getting [the judgment],” he added, referring to Roosevelt.</span></p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Rushmore claims to have “instituted an immediate suspension of foreclosure proceedings in Puerto Rico.”</blockquote>\n<p><span>Roosevelt is an </span><a href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/economia/nota/eldolordeperderlacasa-2342742/\"><span>affiliate of Rushmore Loan Management Services</span></a><span>, which in turn services loans owned by private equity giant </span><a href=\"https://www.tpg.com/\"><span>TPG Capital</span></a><span>, managers of $73 billion in assets.

Related demonstrations were held in eight cities around the world. “This is the first of many companies hurting the people of Puerto Rico and it will be one of many we will be scrutinizing,” said Julio López Varona, a spokesperson for Hedge Clippers, in a statement. “We have asked TPG and Rushmore directly to stop their foreclosures and we will continue to target them until they stop harming Puerto Ricans.”</span></p>\n<p><span>This appears to have made an impact. Rushmore claims to have “instituted an immediate suspension of foreclosure proceedings in Puerto Rico,” per spokesperson Steven Goldberg, including stopping notice by publication. The length of the freeze is indefinite.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Rushmore pursues loan modification or other alternatives to foreclosure first in all cases and remains fully committed to working to keep as many borrowers as possible in their homes,” Goldberg said, “especially in light of the extremely challenging circumstances caused by the hurricane.” He said the company has conducted “extensive outreach efforts” to contact borrowers, given communication problems on the island. Goldberg even provided the number to Rushmore’s Puerto Rico office, (877) 509-8389, and its <a href=\"https://www.rushmorelm.com/es/\">Spanish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rushmorelm.com/\">English</a> websites</span><span>, urging borrowers to contact them to seek a resolution to their situations.</span></p>\n<p><span>TPG’s Clifford added, “We’ve been in constructive dialogue with various advocacy groups, and we plan to continue having those conversations because they are important.”</span></p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/PR-protests-manhattan-1513892402.jpg\"><img alt=\"NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 20: Protestors rally against foreclosures on Puerto Rican families affected by Hurricane Maria, outside the offices of TPG Capital, December 20, 2017 in New York City.

Many have called for those to be extended, but no decision has been made.</span></p>\n<p><span>The voluntary payment moratoria also expire by January. In an </span><a href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/opinion/columnas/vitalextensiondemoratoria-columna-2383346/\"><span>opinion piece</span></a><span> for Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Dia, Ricardo J. Ramos González, who runs the Legal Aid Clinic at the University of Puerto Rico’s School of Law, warned residents that the payment moratorium merely comprised forbearance, not a cancellation of payments. “Those who accepted the moratorium on payments, could very well face a process of collection and eventual foreclosure of their main home, if they are required to pay three months plus the current term,” González wrote. He endorsed a yearlong moratorium on foreclosures, similar to those instituted in some states during the Great Depression.</span></p>\n<p><span>When foreclosure notices and letters from lenders come in the mail in Puerto Rico, they are typically in English. But many Puerto Ricans only speak Spanish. Unlike in local courts, federal court filings are similarly in English, putting homeowners at a disadvantage.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rivera of Derecho a tu Casa claims that lenders have been negotiating loss mitigation with borrowers while also pursuing foreclosure, a scheme known as “dual tracking,” which is supposed to be illegal under </span><a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-rules-establish-strong-protections-for-homeowners-facing-foreclosure/\"><span>federal mortgage servicing laws</span></a><span> and local law in Puerto Rico. The mediation process has not assisted borrowers more generally. “Lawyers cannot participate in the process unless the client gives us special power,” said Rivera. Worse, lenders send representatives who are not empowered to make decisions, she explained. “It’s a pro forma process,” said Rivera. “The banks do not have to give a specific option.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Foreclosure lawyers in Puerto Rico are also finding the same </span><a href=\"https://thenewpress.com/books/chain-of-title\"><span>discrepancies in foreclosure processing</span></a><span> that roiled the United States after the crisis. This is not surprising, since those errors </span><a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/ditech-may-have-hid-mortgage-documents-from-miami-court-9848540\"><span>never really stopped</span></a><span> in the United States. Rivera alleges that investors who came in and scooped up distressed mortgages didn’t follow property records procedures. “There have been cases where there is no mortgage. They don’t have the note,” Rivera said.</span></p>\n<p><span>The endgame of aggressively foreclosing on properties in Puerto Rico — where there is little hope of turning them around to make a profit — is unclear. Offshore lenders “made this investment a couple years ago,” said Baker of Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They’re churning through the portfolio. Maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes.” The insurance payouts also benefit offshore purchasers of distressed mortgages; that alone could turn a profit relative to the small price paid.</span></p>\n<p><span>Derecho a tu Casa offers resources at its </span><a href=\"http://derechoatucasa.org/\"><span>website</span></a><span> to educate homeowners and also representation for those who qualify. “Many people get depressed and we want to give them hope,” Rivera said. “I can see the difference when I represent someone.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>Correction: December 22, 2017 at 3:36 p.m.</strong><br>\nAn earlier version of this piece stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s moratoria on foreclosure sales would expire on December 31.

        "content": "<p><u>Pouco antes das</u> 15h de uma quarta, 29 de novembro, havia apenas três deputados no plenário da Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo (Alesp). Como um discursava sobre a possibilidade de o governo demitir 30 mil professores temporários e os outros dois compunham a mesa diretora, o plenário estava completamente vazio, ainda que o painel eletrônico registrasse 94 presenças e nenhuma ausência.</p>\n<p>Nas galerias, de onde visitantes podem assistir aos debates e votações, havia apenas uma dezena de alunos de uma escola pública de Nova Europa, interior do estado. Eles acompanharam por alguns minutos o deputado que falava para as cadeiras vazias (e para a câmera da TV Assembleia), depois seguiram para outras dependências da casa.</p>\n<p>O coração do legislativo paulista funciona a maior parte do tempo assim, quase que totalmente vazio, com exceção de quando há votações de interesse do governo. Aí a base aliada, que conta com 80% dos deputados, comparece em peso e aprova os projetos de Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB) em ritmo acelerado.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">Há atualmente oito mil propostas de lei prontas, mas sem previsão de serem votadas.</blockquote>\n<p>Na legislatura atual, portanto a partir de janeiro de 2015, entre leis ordinárias e complementares, o governador presidenciável enviou 95 projetos. Todos aprovados. No mesmo período, o deputado Carlos Giannazi (PSOL), um dos parlamentares mais atuantes da casa, encaminhou 125 projetos. Aprovou onze:um orientava a diminuição de alunos em sala de aula, quatro diziam respeito à denominação de lugares (túneis, escolas, viadutos, etc), um dava o título de “utilidade pública” a  uma associação beneficiente e cinco criavam dias em homenagem homenagem a algo, entre eles o dia estadual do violão na MPB.</p>\n<p>A gigantesca diferença na taxa de sucesso tem a ver com o fato de que o plenário é, na prática, um grande teatro. Assim como na maior parte das casas legislativas, as decisões de fato são tomadas nas reuniões do colégio de líderes, que ocorrem a portas fechadas, às terças e quartas-feiras. Ali, as lideranças dos partidos, do governo e da minoria, decidem o que vai tramitar e o que vai seguir na fila. Como Alckmin tem a maioria e a presidência da casa, são raros os projetos de oposição que conseguem ir adiante. Há atualmente oito mil propostas de lei prontas, mas sem previsão de serem votadas.</p>\n<h3><b>“Permaneçam como estão”</b></h3>\n<p>O prédio da Alesp tem 50 mil metros quadrados e ergue-se em frente ao parque do Ibirapuera, num bairro nobre, longe do centro e com carência de transporte público – o que faz com que protestos e manifestações tornem-se raridade. Cada deputado recebe um salário de R$ 25,3 mil e pode contratar 32 pessoas a um custo total de até R$ 160 mil. O orçamento de todo esse sistema é considerável: R$ 1,1 bilhão ao ano para criar leis para o Estado e fiscalizar e controlar as ações do executivo.</p>\n<p>O problema é que, como se vê pelo índice de aprovação de leis encaminhadas pelo governador, a Alesp funciona mais como um <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/30/conluio-de-elites-sufoca-a-democracia-em-sao-paulo/\">puxadinho do Bandeirantes</a> do que como um poder independente dele.</p>\n<p>Nesse sistema, curiosamente, a presença da maioria dos deputados não se faz assim tão importante. O regimento interno da casa e a Constituição Estadual oferecem certa liberdade aos políticos. Eles são obrigados a comparecer à Casa nas sessões ordinárias, que ocorrem às terças, quartas e quintas-feiras, mas podem justificar até quatro faltas. Se faltarem mais, passam a ser descontados.</p>\n<p>O comparecimento, contudo, não tem de ocorrer exatamente na hora em que as sessões estão em andamento. Os deputados precisam apenas assinar a lista de presença, o que pode ser feito das 9h às 19h. Se houver 24 assinaturas, considera-se que há quórum para se discutir as leis do Estado e os trabalhos vão adiante. Às segundas e sextas, as sessões são deliberativas. Para que tenham início é preciso apenas doze assinaturas em lista e, uma vez que elas são atingidas, todos recebem presença.</p>\n<p>O sistema de votação também ajuda nesse funcionamento modo piloto-automático. Quando há consenso, a tomada de votos ocorre de forma simbólica. Ao microfone, o presidente da sessão simplesmente pede que todos “permaneçam como estão”, caso aprovem determinada medida. Só quando não há consenso os parlamentares costumam solicitar a verificação de presença e os votos passam a ser computados no painel eletrônico. Nesses casos os deputados ausentes recebem falta mesmo tendo assinado a presença. A lista com essas assinaturas supostamente é pública, mas, na prática, apenas os deputados têm acesso a ela.</p>\n<p>A Alesp informou que as presenças dos deputados só são divulgadas no fim de cada mês, depois de eles justificarem suas faltas. Mas não existe um balanço total de quantos deputados assinaram a lista. O que também não seria muito útil, porque as assinaturas não necessariamente correspondem à presença física. Ou seja, na prática é impossível saber quantos parlamentares de fato pisam no plenário com alguma frequência.</p>\n<p>O espanto que isso pode causar em quem não está acostumado aos trâmites da política estadual não se estende a boa parte dos que trabalham diretamente na assembleia, aos (poucos) jornalistas que cobrem a casa, e à maioria dos deputados. Há um entendimento geral de que a política não necessariamente é feita na Assembleia, e pode ocorrer nas bases, em discussões com o povo, pelo interior do Estado.</p>\n<p>Quanto aos que assinam a lista, mas não estão fisicamente no plenário, a justificativa também é simples: muitos dos deputados estariam na casa, mas, ao menos durante parte do expediente, ficariam ocupados nas comissões, onde os projetos são debatidos antes da votação final.</p>\n<p>Na quarta em que havia apenas três deputados em plenário, quatro comissões funcionavam em paralelo à sessão ordinária. Três delas não tinham a maioria dos participantes presentes, e a falta de quórum inviabilizava qualquer tomada de decisão.</p>\n<p>Uma das poucas que funcionava de fato era a Comissão de Constituição, Justiça e Redação, que serve como um primeiro filtro para todos os projetos propostos, avaliando se o conteúdo está escrito de forma aceitável e se não há nada que vá contra a Constituição do Estado.</p>\n<p>Passava um pouco das 15h quando o deputado Roberto Trípoli (PV) pediu a palavra por uma questão de ordem. O projeto que era discutido, do deputado Sebastião dos Santos (PRB), autorizava o governador a instalar um restaurante Bom Prato em Barretos, cidade de origem do parlamentar.</p>\n<p>“Está escrito em algum lugar que o governador precisa de autorização do poder legislativo para instalar um Bom Prato onde ele bem quiser?”, indagou o deputado.</p>\n<p>Os demais deram de ombros, houve um período de desconforto seguido de um breve debate que jogou alguma luz sobre o impasse. De fato, o governador não precisa de autorização de ninguém para instalar restaurantes que oferecem refeições a preços populares onde bem entender.</p>\n<p>O deputado Sebastião dos Santos provavelmente sabe disso, mas propôs o projeto mesmo assim. A peça nunca dificilmente irá para votação. Deve servir apenas para que o parlamentar mostre a seus eleitores que está lutando por um Bom Prato na região, ou algo do tipo. E, se um dia o governador resolver erguer o tal restaurante, certamente lá estará o nobre deputado, gabando-se de ter brigado bravamente pelo povo de Barretos.</p>\n<p>A prática é bastante comum no legislativo nacional e propostas do tipo têm até um nome: são os projetos “autorizativos”. Os deputados que os defendem, argumentam que eles servem como um direcionamento ao executivo. Por meio do projeto de Sebastião Santos, o governador seria alertado da necessidade de um Bom Prato em Barretos.</p>\n<p>Para Trípoli, a prática “ é um desperdício do nosso tempo. E de papel, de clips, de impressora, de energia elétrica. É um desperdício do dinheiro do contribuinte”, argumentou Tripoli. O projeto foi aprovado por 5 votos a 2 e seguiu para ser discutido na comissão seguinte.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/com-verba-de-r-11-bi-plenario-vazio-e-projeto-inutil-alesp-funciona-como-puxadinho-de-alckmin/\">Com verba de R$ 1,1 bi, plenário vazio e projeto inútil, Alesp funciona como puxadinho de Alckmin</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Isso sem falar daquele primo adolescente que pediu o livro do Bolsonaro no amigo oculto e do tio que acredita que racismo não existe.</p>\n<p>Listamos alguns assuntos que renderam muitos textões nas redes sociais em 2017 para que você possa se preparar e ter as melhores respostas para os parentes nessa data festiva.</p>\n<h3>A arte está nua</h3>\n<p><span>Em um curto espaço de tempo, tivemos o </span><a href=\"https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/09/11/politica/1505164425_555164.html\"><span>encerramento da </span><span>exposição</span></a><span> Queermuseu – Cartografias da Diferença na Arte Brasileira, a polêmica sobre a </span><a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/interacao-de-crianca-com-artista-nu-em-museu-de-sp-gera-polemica.ghtml\"><span>performance de um artista nu no Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo</span></a><span> e a discussão sobre a</span><a href=\"https://revistacult.uol.com.br/home/historia-sexualidade-classificacao-indicativa-censura/\"><span> classificação etária da mostra “História da Sexualidade”</span></a><span>, no Museu de Arte de São Paulo.

Quando o preto abre a boca para denunciar algum ato racista real, é taxado de vitimista e escuta logo que toda a sua argumentação não passa de mimimi. Afinal, “somos todos humanos”.</p>\n<p><span>Quando Taís Araújo fala que pessoas mudam de calçada quando veem seu filho negro, o </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/01/a-aula-de-racismo-e-machismo-a-brasileira-do-secretario-de-educacao-do-rio/\"><span>secretário de educação do Rio de Janeiro sente-se ofendido</span></a><span>.

Não pode mentir no Natal, hein? Precisamos falar umas verdades.</span></p>\n<h3>Aborto</h3>\n<p><span>O ano começou com a </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/04/aborto-stf-e-palco-da-batalha-definitiva-pela-descriminalizacao/\"><span>inconstitucionalidade do aborto sendo debatida no Supremo Tribunal</span></a><span> Federal e terminou com a discussão da sua proibição até mesmo em casos de estupro com a </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/13/mulheres-marcham-contra-a-pec-que-proibe-aborto/\"><span>PEC 181</span></a><span> – projeto que avança sendo </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/10/quem-sao-os-18-homens-que-querem-legislar-sobre-o-corpo-das-mulheres/\"><span>debatido por homens</span></a><span>.

Caso aconteça, diga a todos que o aborto vai continuar acontecendo de qualquer maneira, que mulheres vão continuar morrendo por conta de procedimentos inadequados e que provavelmente </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/03/07/voce-tambem-deve-conhecer-uma-mulher-que-ja-abortou/\"><span>alguma mocinha da própria família já abortou</span></a><span>. O climão é certo. Testado e aprovado.</span></p>\n<h3>Cura Gay</h3>\n<p>Em 2017, os LGBTQi puderam meter atestado no trabalho ou se acharam no direito de fazer isso. Uma ação deu permissão para que psicólogos pudessem aplicar o tratamento de reversão sexual, também conhecido como cura gay. Vale lembrar que a Organização Mundial da Saúde não considera a homossexualidade como patologia há 30 anos.</p>\n<p><span>A autora da ação,</span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/19/autora-da-acao-da-cura-gay-tem-cargo-em-gabinete-de-deputado-evangelico/\"><span> Rozangela Alves Justino possui desde junho de 2016 um cargo no gabinete do deputado evangélico Sóstenes Cavalcante</span></a><span> (DEM-RJ) na Câmara, apadrinhado pelo líder da Assembleia de Deus Vitória em Cristo, pastor Silas Malafaia. Ou seja, assim como a PEC 181, o projeto que autoriza do tratamento da “cura gay” foi mais um lobby da bancada evangélica.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9uAisPRL_A\"><span>Yukeeeee</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<h3>Eleições 2018</h3>\n<p>Uma das grandes polêmicas de 2017 é o que vai acontecer em 2018. Parece que foi ontem que você  bloqueou seu primo do Facebook, mas já faz quatro anos. É difícil prever o cenário político do próximo ano, mas uma coisa é certa: as brigas no grupo da família estão voltando com tudo. Então, se prepare.</p>\n<p><span>Michel Temer é carta fora do baralho. </span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/05/12/o-papel-da-imprensa-no-julgamento-de-lula/\"><span>Lula aguarda o julgamento</span></a><span> do Tribunal Regional Federal, que acontece no próximo dia 24 de janeiro, para definir sua candidatura.

Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. Andiola and her fellow protesters were on a hunger strike while in jail, and her <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210673636932907&set=a.1324569190129.2047092.1107842462&type=3&theater\">Facebook post</a> about being detained went viral over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The group was demanding that Schumer and Curbelo vote against a must-pass federal spending bill unless it contains a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/09/dreamers-dream-act-protest-daca-immigration/\">measure known as the DREAM Act</a>, which would bring protections for Dreamers, without any compromises on harsher immigration policies.</p>\n<p>“Our lives are at stake,” said Andiola, a former presidential campaign staffer for Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in an interview with The Intercept minutes after she left jail. “Undocumented youth are not bargaining chips.”</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">“We were very clear: Don’t throw our Dreamers under the bus.”</blockquote>\n<p>In a sign of intra-party tension on the issue, more than a dozen members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus followed the Dreamers’ lead and stormed Schumer’s office Thursday afternoon before demanding answers for the delay on measure addressing the Dreamers. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/hispanic-caucus-clashes-with-schumer-over-dreamers-delay\">told Bloomberg</a> that Schumer had agreed more Senate Democrats should vote down the bill but said he feared the party being blamed for a government shutdown. “We were very clear: Don’t throw our Dreamers under the bus,” Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, D-Ill., <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/dream-act-hispanic-lawmakers-march-on-schumers-office/\">said</a> after the meeting.</p>\n<p>On Thursday evening, a day after the Dreamer activists were released, Congress <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/dream-act-hispanic-lawmakers-march-on-schumers-office/\">passed</a> a temporary stopgap spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. The bill merely extends government funding until January 19 and did not include any measures on the Dreamers. Schumer and Curbelo kept their word by voting against the bill, but <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/12/why_democrats_folded_on_a_daca_fix.html\">reports circulated</a> Thursday evening indicating that Schumer had failed to whip his caucus against the bill. Seventeen Democrats voted for the bill in the Senate, allowing the measure to pass without any fix for the Dreamers.</p>\n<p><u>Andiola was 11</u> when her mother came to the U.S. from Durango, Mexico, with her and her four siblings, to escape domestic violence. At the time, Andiola said, she was old enough to realize she was undocumented, a fact that didn’t stop her from excelling in school and landing seven college scholarships. Andiola said she became politically active when, in 2006, Arizona passed a referendum that prohibited in-state tuition rates for undocumented students — a near-fatal blow to her chances of pursuing a college degree.</p>\n<p>Andiola’s fate and that of the nation’s <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_population_data.pdf\">nearly 700,000 Dreamers</a> lies with Congress after Trump’s September decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The program granted Dreamers work permits and, while not providing them formal legal status, gave them protection against deportation. Widespread <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/cd4b2d91423a4b3aab022041df149622/AP-NORC-Poll:-Most-don%27t-want-young-immigrants-deported?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Politics\">public support for Dreamers</a> has put pressure on Congress to act to codify DACA protections before a temporary extension of the program expires in March.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/19/senate-white-house-trump-lay-groundwork-for-daca-deal-306298\">Politico</a><em> </em>reported this week that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly met with a bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday to hammer out a compromise. The proposed deal, according to Politico, would include security measures – such as expanding the existing border fence – and would not be considered until January.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“It’s 2017. We are sick of waiting. We are sick of empty words.”</blockquote>\n<p>The Dreamers said any promise for a deal in an election year is unlikely, and they oppose tacking on other harsh immigration policies. Politicians “have been telling us since 2001 that they want to pass a DREAM Act,” said Li Adorno, a 24-year-old community organizer who was among those arrested. “It’s 2017. We are sick of waiting. We are sick of empty words.”</p>\n<p>The group’s decision to protest outside Curbelo and Schumer’s offices was strategic, said Adorno. Both members of Congress have been outspoken supporters of passing a law with DACA-like protections in this congressional session. Curbelo has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/12/11/key-gop-voice-on-immigration-accuses-bipartisan-caucus-of-withholding-a-potential-dreamers-compromise/?utm_term=.32a7eb49a498\">one of the few</a> members of the Republican caucus to demand a legislative solution before the year’s end. For his part, Schumer has heavily criticized Trump’s decision to end DACA and made numerous predictions that a clean DREAM Act – without compromises like the border fence – would reach the president’s desk by December 31. In recent weeks, however, Schumer has backed off from that pledge as Democrats up for re-election in more conservative states in 2018 have pushed back.</p>\n<p>In a statement to The Intercept, a spokesperson said Curbelo remained committed to finding a bipartisan solution. “He’s pledged to withhold his support for any spending past December 31 until action is taken on a solution,” the statement reads. “[The Dreamers have] lived in fear for far too long and it is past time leadership in both Chambers allow a solution to come to the floor.”</p>\n<p>The Intercept reached out on several occasions to Schumer’s office but was not provided comment.</p>\n<p>The Dreamers on Capitol Hill criticized Schumer along with other Democrats who they said have staged photo-ops with Dreamers to distance themselves from Trump’s hawkish immigration policy, but have failed to have the courage to actually force his hand. “We don’t want photo-ops,” said Juan Carlos Carabantes, 22, who came to the U.S. when he was 4 years old. “We want action.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Protesters fill the waiting room of the office of Senate Minority Leader Sen.

        "content": "<p><u>Harris County</u> Sheriff’s Deputy Darren Goforth was filling the tank of his cruiser at a gas station outside Houston, Texas, when he was ambushed and shot repeatedly in the back of the head by a man named Shannon Miles. Miles was quickly apprehended and charged with Goforth’s murder; there was little doubt that prosecutors would seek the death penalty.</p>\n<p>It was exactly the kind of crime that in the not-too-distant past would have been a slam-dunk death case in Harris County, which has the dubious distinction of having sent more people to death row than any jurisdiction in the nation and, aside from the state of Texas as a whole, is responsible for the greatest number of executions.</p>\n<p>Still, there were problems with the case: Miles had a history of mental illness and had to be hospitalized in order to ensure his competency to stand trial. While such issues haven’t traditionally stopped the state from seeking — or securing — a death sentence in any number of troubling cases, in September, at the urging of Goforth’s widow, prosecutors agreed that the death penalty should be taken off the table and Miles should be sentenced to life without parole.</p>\n<p>The outcome of a case like Miles’s points toward a deeper understanding of the issues that plague capital punishment and suggests a “reflection on the fact that there are no crimes and no defendants that are automatic symbols of death anymore,” Kristin Houlé, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, told The Intercept.</p>\n<p>Indeed, 2017 marked the third year in a row that Harris County did not send any new defendants to death row. Even more dramatic, it was the first year in more than three decades that no one from the county was executed. Texas added just four new names to its death row roster in 2017, down from a peak of 48 new sentences in 1999; and the state executed seven individuals, down from a high of 40 put to death in 2000, according to a new <a href=\"http://tcadp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Texas-Death-Penalty-Developments-in-2017-Year-in-Review.pdf\">report</a> by the TCADP.</p>\n<p>The lack of new death sentences or executions out of Harris County is also notable in its reflection of the change in attitudes about capital punishment across the United States, says Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “It’s symbolic because Harris County has executed more people than any other county. And it is emblematic in that the long-term trend we’re seeing is away from the death penalty.”</p>\n<p>In its year-end <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/2017YrEnd.pdf\">report</a>, the Death Penalty Information Center projected that by month’s end, a total of just 39 new death sentences will have been imposed in 2017 — down from a stunning 315-sentence total in 1996. Similarly, there were a total of 23 executions carried out, down from a high of 98 in 1999. There are currently 2,817 people in the U.S. living under a death sentence.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/death-penalty-protest-1513808210.jpg\"><img alt=\"Activists hold signs with the names of people executed in the United States since 1977 during an anti death penalty protest in front of the US Supreme Court January 17, 2017 in Washington, DC. / AFP / Brendan Smialowski        (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/death-penalty-protest-1513808210-1024x682.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-163354\"></a>\n<p>Activists hold signs with the names of people executed in the United States since 1977 during an anti-death penalty protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 17, 2017, in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<h3>Waning Public Support for the Death Penalty</h3>\n<p>In October, <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/221030/death-penalty-support-lowest-1972.aspx\">Gallup</a> found that just 55 percent of Americans said they favored capital punishment, the lowest level of support since 1972 — the year the landmark case known as Furman v. Georgia was <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/69-5030\">argued</a> before the U.S. Supreme Court. In Furman, lawyers for death row inmates argued that the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The court ultimately found that the way the death penalty was administered at the time was racist and arbitrary and concluded that it should be banned. In 1976, the court’s ruling in Gregg v. Georgia allowed for the resumption of capital punishment based on the notion that it would be less arbitrary and capricious if reserved only for those who commit <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-6257\">the most heinous of crimes</a>.</p>\n<p>Forty-five years later, with national sentiment turning against the death penalty, the high court could again be poised to consider its legality. <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17-251-petition.pdf\">Pending</a> before the court is a case that asks the justices to consider whether the promise that capital punishment would be imposed in a responsible manner, narrowed to capture only the worst of the worst, has been kept. Lawyers representing Abel Daniel Hidalgo in Arizona say the state — and the nation — has not restricted the use of capital punishment to such situations. Neal Katyal, the former Obama administration solicitor general who is representing Hidalgo, argues that instead of narrowing eligibility, Arizona has so grossly expanded it as to expose “virtually every” person charged with murder to the possibility of the death penalty, which violates constitutional protections.</p>\n<p>Today, Dunham says, the “social factors” at play “mirror the conditions that were present when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty” in 1972. “I think there is little question that the Furman court, if it were reviewing the death penalty today, would reach the same conclusion. And the Gregg court would reach that same conclusion, because several of the justices from the Gregg court who upheld the death sentence at that time came to change their minds.” The only difference now, he says, “is the current composition of the court.”</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Texas-protest-death-penalty-1513788568.jpg\"><img alt=\"Mark Clements (R), who was imprisoned for 28 years before being released and exonerated, wipes sweat from his brow while advocating for the commutation of Jeff Wood's sentence outside of the Texas State Insurance Building, where the Office of Governor Gregg Abbott is located, on August 18, 2016 in Austin, Texas. Clements joined friends and family of Jeff Wood and anti-death penalty activists to deliver a petition with over 10,000 signatures asking the governor and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute Wood's sentence. Jeff Wood is scheduled to be executed by the state of Texas on August 24, 2016 under what is referred to as the &quot;law of parties&quot; for a criminal act he committed on January 2, 1996.

Similarly, in Riverside County, California — <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6566\">dubbed</a> the “buckle of a new Death Belt” — every defendant sentenced to death over the past two years has been a person of color, DPIC reports; in the five years before that, it was 76 percent. In <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/08/arkansas-plans-to-execute-seven-people-this-month-continuing-long-tradition-of-assembly-line-killing/\">Arkansas</a>, where officials raced to execute eight people this year in an effort to use their stock of lethal injection drugs before it expired, there were four stays of execution. “Can you guess the race of those who got stays?” asks Dunham. Three out of four were white; three out of the four who were executed were black.</p>\n<p>Four men were exonerated from death row this year, bringing the number of death row exonerees across the country to 160. Their cases highlight the flaws in the system, from insufficient evidence and prosecutorial misconduct to the high incidence of defendants with mental illness and intellectual disability. Meanwhile, according to DPIC, more than 90 percent of those who were executed in 2017 showed significant evidence of mental illness, intellectual disability, a history of severe trauma, or actual innocence — a circumstance that underscores the arbitrariness of application and outcome that once helped to condemn the capital punishment system.</p>\n<p>Further highlighting the problem is the fact that location — not the nature of the crime — remains the best predictor of who will face a death sentence. A 2013 DPIC <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/TwoPercentReport.pdf\">report</a> demonstrated that the majority of death sentences at the time had arisen out of just 2 percent of the nation’s counties. In 2017, the skewing of the system by so-called outlier counties continued: Maricopa County, Arizona — where the Hidalgo case pending before the Supreme Court originated — accounted for three new death sentences, while Clark County, Nevada, added four; Riverside County handed down five new death sentences. All three jurisdictions have long been on the list of outliers. “Three counties, which represent fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of the counties in the United States, accounted for 31 percent of all new death sentences,” Dunham said.</p>\n<div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Kathleen-Goforth-executions-1513782537.jpg\"><img alt=\"Kathleen Goforth, widow of Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth, holds up a photo of her late husband as she spoke to the media after Shannon Miles pled guilty at the Harris County Civil Courthouse, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2017, in Houston.

At a press conference, Goforth showed reporters a family photo. “Mine and Darren’s two children have been spared. They will not have the backdrop of their lives, for the next 10 to 25 years, being court dates, trials, and appeals,” she <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Hearing-scheduled-for-Shannon-Miles-12194360.php\">said</a>. “They won’t have that inflicted on them and that is merciful. It’s compassionate, and it’s the right thing to do.”</p>\n<p>Goforth’s thinking may well reflect larger changes in the way victims, juries, judges, and an increasing number of prosecutors consider the death penalty, both Houlé and Dunham say. “There is still a long way to go,” said Houlé, “but I think we’re on the right track.”</p>\n<p>Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/11/10/overzealous-prosecutors-ousted-across-the-country-showing-there-is-still-hope-for-reform/\">elected</a> to her position last year as a reform-minded prosecutor, seems to embody much of the thinking that influenced the continued demise of the death penalty in 2017. “This has been an important year in terms of death penalty litigation,” Ogg <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/For-first-time-in-more-than-30-years-no-Harris-12405400.php\">told</a> the Houston Chronicle this fall. “I view it as a positive thing. I don’t think that being the death penalty capital of America is a selling point for Harris County.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: A cemetery for prisoners, with some 3,000 graves since the 19th century, is pictured on May 21, 2013, in Huntsville, Texas.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/death-penalty-harris-county-texas/\">For the First Time in Three Decades, the “Death Penalty Capital of America” Goes Without an Execution</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

It instructs you exactly how to feel at every moment as the Post’s executive editor Ben Bradlee (played by Tom Hanks) pushes to get a copy of the papers – a top secret Defense Department study of decades of U.S. involvement in Vietnam – and then persuades the Post’s owner Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep) to publish them in the face of extreme legal peril. It’s like the score to a Star Wars movie.</p>\n<p>Then at the end when the credits roll, you’ll understand why: It’s by John Williams.</p>\n<p>And as you walk out, punchy with the thrill of good triumphing over evil, you may realize “The Post” is like a Star Wars movie in several key ways – specifically “Return of the Jedi.”</p>\n<p>Now that we know how the story continues in “The Force Awakens” and “The Last Jedi,” it’s obvious that the victory at the end of “Return of the Jedi” was an illusion. Our lionhearted heroes do not live the rest of their lives basking in the joy of their moral perfection, but screw everything up and turn out to be dangerously flawed. What seemed like the final conquest of iniquity turns out to have been a skirmish in a different, bleaker war.</p>\n<p>Exactly the same is true for “The Post.” Yes, Graham’s willingness to run stories based on the Pentagon Papers — in the face of a court injunction against the New York Times for first publishing excerpts days before – was courageous. Most importantly, the eventual Supreme Court ruling in New York Times Co. v. United States was a <a href=\"https://billofrightsinstitute.org/educate/educator-resources/lessons-plans/landmark-supreme-court-cases-elessons/new-york-times-v-united-states-1971/\">critical landmark</a> in establishing that the First Amendment means what it says. Spielberg’s enormous bag of trickery can feel manipulative when he uses it to turn your emotions up to 11 about something imaginary and meaningless. But you actually should feel it deeply when Post editorial writer Meg Greenfield (Carrie Coon) is called with the decision and conveys it bit by bit to the rest of the newsroom.</p>\n<p>But 46 years later we know the rest of the story about the Washington Post, Graham and Bradlee. And in retrospect everything about what happened then looks different.</p>\n<p>The sneakiest thing about “The Post” is its inclusion of what almost always gets left out of movies about the media: money. (The script is co-written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer. Singer also co-wrote “Spotlight.”) Throughout the film Graham is largely focused not on what’s in the newspaper, but that the Washington Post Company is selling public stock for the first time — just as the Post obtains the Pentagon Papers.</p>\n<p>She therefore spends less time huddling with editors, and more with the lawyers and bankers running the IPO. A large part of her concern about publishing the Pentagon Papers is a clause in the company’s contract that would allow buyers to void the sale if some kind of catastrophic event happens within a week. She frets as she’s informed that institutional investors don’t like the fact that the Post, unlike some other papers, isn’t a monopoly. And felons can’t own broadcast licenses, so if the Post is convicted under the Espionage Act it will lose its profitable TV stations.</p>\n<p>Graham finally forges ahead, informing a plethora of white financial men that she believes that “quality and profitability go hand in hand.”</p>\n<p>The problem is that we now know that just isn’t true. High-quality, high-impact journalism that holds powerful institutions accountable isn’t just not profitable, it’s anti-profit. Good journalism is expensive. It takes forever. It scares off advertisers. The powerful fight back, and can inflict enormous additional legal costs even if they don’t win. And if they win they can <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/08/peter-thiel-just-got-wish-gawker-shutting/\">drive you out of business</a>.</p>\n<p>Graham wasn’t crazy to believe what she did: “The Post” occurs in the brief moment in the 1970s when it seemed like these rules had been changed. But in retrospect we can see this was an odd historical anomaly, not the beginning of a new normal. The Post and other outlets were floating on a wave of advertising money from businesses that had no other way to reach a gigantic new middle class. As soon as that middle class deteriorated, and corporations had other technological options to reach consumers with cash to spend, the profitability of American journalism collapsed – first slowly and then very very fast.</p>\n<p>The Post held on longer than many of its peers, which have expired across the U.S. as though there were some kind of a bubonic plague targeting newspapers. But the Post’s financial success, while it lasted, had less to do with any kind of “quality” than that it eventually did establish a monopoly, in America’s richest metro area.</p>\n<p>Warren Buffett was an early, crucial investor in the Washington Post Company. As described in a 2000 New Yorker article, the paper appealed to him because of his investment philosophy, which is to avoid competitive capitalism whenever possible. “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society,” Buffett explained in a speech. “The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.”</p>\n<p>The moat around the Post was deep in 1971. But it finally dried up. Following years of huge losses, Katherine Graham’s son Donald was forced to sell the paper in 2013 to one of the few people who definitely had the resources to keep it alive: Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, now the world’s richest man.</p>\n<p>Post-Pentagon Papers and post-Watergate it also became clear Graham and Bradlee were not white knights of journalism. In a 1988 speech at the CIA, Graham portrayed herself as a responsible member of the U.S. establishment who could be trusted to dole out just the right amount of information to unwashed Americans. “We live in a dirty and dangerous world,” Graham said. “There are some things the general public does not need to know, and shouldn’t. I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows.”</p>\n<p>And while “The Post” portrays Graham and Bradlee as agreeing that the days have to end when they both censored the news to protect their powerful friends, they didn’t. Robert Parry, a reporter who worked at Newsweek in the 1980s (then owned by the Washington Post Company) has written that he was “told that my story about the CIA funneling anti-Sandinista money through Nicaragua’s Catholic Church had been watered down because the story needed to be run past Mrs. Graham, and Henry Kissinger was her house guest that weekend.”</p>\n<p>Then there’s Bradlee. One story left out of “The Post” is that the company’s IPO led him to resign from its board because the salaries of board members were now going to become public. Bradlee <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpNIuIcd90C&lpg=PP1&dq=%22That%20upset%20her%20some%20but%20nearly%20as%20much%20as%20it%20upset%20Ben%20Bradlee%22&pg=PT1120#v=onepage&q=%22decided%20that%20he%20could%20not%20edit%20the%20paper%22&f=false\">didn’t want his reporters</a> to know how much he was making. Then he was evasive when his employees asked how much his Post stock was worth.</p>\n<p>Bradlee also did not cover himself in glory as the disastrous problems with establishment journalism were revealed by the march to war with Iraq. Bradlee <a href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/001906.html\">publicly proclaimed</a> that he was “embarrassed” by the 2004 apologies by both the Post and the New York Times. Why? Because “I don’t think they really have a hell of a lot to hang their head about.” If you didn’t like their Iraq coverage, he informed us, “you’ve got to lump that.”</p>\n<p>But those were personal issues. The overwhelming problems for journalism are structural, not individual. So go see “The Post” – it’s incredibly well-made, it’s dramatic, and it’s surprisingly accurate. Just remember that Katherine Graham could stand up to the government, but in the end her paper could not stand up to the Force of capitalism.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep in the “The Post” Film, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/the-real-drama-in-the-post-isnt-about-journalism-vs-the-government-its-about-journalism-vs-capitalism/\">The Real Drama in “The Post” Isn’t About Journalism vs. the Government.

        "content": "<p><u>Like many other</u> journalists, activists, and software developers I know, I carry my laptop everywhere while I’m traveling. It contains sensitive information; messaging app conversations, email, password databases, encryption keys, unreleased work, web browsers  logged into various accounts, and so on. My <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/encrypting-laptop-like-mean/\">disk is encrypted</a>, but all it takes to bypass this protection is for an attacker — a malicious hotel housekeeper, or “<a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/10/evil_maid_attac.html\">evil maid</a>,” for example — to spend a few minutes physically tampering with it without my knowledge. If I come back and continue to use my compromised computer, the attacker could gain access to everything.</p>\n<p>Edward Snowden and his friends have a solution. The NSA whistleblower and a team of collaborators have been working on a new <a href=\"https://github.com/guardianproject/haven\">open source</a> Android app called <a href=\"https://guardianproject.github.io/haven/\">Haven</a> that you install on a spare smartphone, turning the device into a sort of sentry to watch over your laptop. Haven uses the smartphone’s many sensors — microphone, motion detector, light detector, and cameras — to monitor the room for changes, and it logs everything it notices. The first public beta version of Haven has officially been released; it’s available in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.havenapp.main\">Play Store</a> and on <a href=\"https://guardianproject.github.io/haven-nightly/\">F-Droid</a>, an open source app store for Android.</p>\n<p>Snowden is helping to develop the software through a project he leads at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which receives funding from The Intercept’s parent company. I sit on the FPF board with Snowden, am an FPF founder, and lent some help developing the app, including through nine months of testing. With that noted, I’ll be forthright about the product’s flaws below, and have solicited input for this article from people not involved in the project.</p>\n<p>Also collaborating on Haven is the Guardian Project, a global collective of mobile security app developers.</p>\n<p>Haven is an external solution to a problem computer makers traditionally attempted to handle from within their devices. Some laptops, for example, offer “secure boot” through a special tamper-resistant chip called a Trusted Platform Module, which tries to ensure that the computer’s bootloader code hasn’t been modified to be malicious. But there are various ways this could go wrong: there can be bugs in the code that does the verification, attackers could connive to get their code marked as trustworthy, or malicious code could be inserted after the bootloader. Some computer users have tried the low-tech solution of <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5xwy/itll-take-more-than-glitter-nail-polish-to-stop-snooping\">painting glitter nail polish</a> on their laptop screws, creating a sort of seal that would be broken during a tampering attempt.</p>\n<p>“Due to how current laptops, and probably most other computing devices, are made today, it is virtually impossible to systematically check later if the laptop has been compromised or not,” said <span>Joanna Rutkowska, founder of the secure Qubes operating system, who invented the term “evil maid” in 2009 as part of her work as a security researcher.</span></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr0wEsISRUw\" height=\"400px\"></iframe>\n<p>Here’s how Haven might work: You lock your laptop in a hotel safe —  <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hotel-safes-not-safe-secure_us_55f17c9ee4b002d5c0783381\">not a secure move</a> on its own — and place your Haven phone on top of it. If someone opens the safe while you’re away, the phone’s light meter might detect a change in lighting, its microphone might hear the safe open (and even the attacker speak), its accelerometer might detect motion if the attacker moves the laptop, and its camera might even capture a snapshot of the attacker’s face. The Haven app will log all of this evidence locally on the Android device.</p>\n<div> <img alt=\"\" width=\"540\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/haven_screenshot-1513645038-540x960.png\" class=\"wp-image-162941\" height=\"960\">\n<p>Intrusion events in the Haven app</p>\n</div>\n<p>You can configure Haven to send you real-time encrypted alerts of what it detects to your other phone, the one you carry with you, when an intrusion is detected. You can choose to get encrypted <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/05/01/cybersecurity-for-the-people-how-to-keep-your-chats-truly-private-with-signal/\">Signal</a> notifications, and you can also configure Haven to run a Tor onion service website (that is, a darknet site), and use Tor Browser on another device to connect in and view all of the alerts — all without giving anyone else access to these evidence logs unless you choose to share them. Haven also supports SMS text notifications, which can be intercepted but which might be more reliable in some situations.</p>\n<div> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/haven_signal_notification-1513706405-540x960.png\" class=\"wp-image-163024\">\n<p>Real-time encrypted Signal notifications of intrusion events from Haven</p>\n</div>\n<p>Protecting my laptop against evil maid attacks is my primary use-case for Haven, but it isn’t the only reason people might be interested in using the app.”I can imagine this might be useful to victims of domestic abuse who are worried about their abusers spying on them in some way,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity for Electronic Frontier Foundation, said. Galperin is familiar with the security challenges of evil maid attacks, but has not tested out Haven herself. “This might be useful for teenagers who are concerned about their parents, or who are concerned about nosy partners, or friends [spying on them]. Or if you’re in college and you’re worried about your roommate,” she added.</p>\n<p>Galperin’s main concern about Haven is false positives. “If you’re concerned about people coming into the room and moving things, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they have ill intent. Or you could be setting things up on a hair trigger, and then you end up with a bunch of false positives and get paranoid for no reason,” she said. “Maybe the maid isn’t evil. Sometimes the maid is just a maid.”</p>\n<p>Haven can also be used as a cheap home or office security system to detect break-ins or vandalism while you’re away, positioning the phone to send you photographs when someone walks within range. Or you can use it to monitor for wildlife in rural areas, or to capture evidence of human rights violations and disappearances.</p>\n<p>Based on my experience testing Haven so far, here are some of the things to consider.</p>\n<p>You definitely need a separate Android device to use Haven effectively, but you don’t actually need to pay for phone service for that device if you don’t want to. Without phone service, here are your options for using Haven:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You could choose to not get notifications on your other phone at all, and instead just check the local Haven logs once you get back to the room you’re monitoring.</li>\n<li>You could connect to a wifi network (like the hotel’s network) on your Haven phone, and configure Haven to run a Tor onion service website directly on the phone. You can then use <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en\">Tor Browser</a> on a computer, <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox/\">Orfox</a> on an Android phone, or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8\">Onion Browser</a> on an iPhone to load this website to check for intrusion alerts. To do this, you need to install the <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/\">Orbot</a> app, which is Tor for Android, on your Haven phone as well.</li>\n<li>You could also connect to wifi and configure Haven to send you real-time Signal notifications as intrusion events happen. This is the most user friendly way of getting alerts. However, without phone service, it’s not trivial to set up because you’ll need to obtain an extra phone number to register a new Signal account with, like described in <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/28/signal-tutorial-second-phone-number/\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do pay for phone service for your Haven phone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your phone plan includes mobile data, you don’t have to worry about wifi being available. In fact, I’d recommend disabling wifi and only using mobile data.</li>\n<li>You can use the Haven app to register a Signal account using your spare phone’s phone number, to send encrypted notifications to your normal phone via Signal.</li>\n<li>You can also choose to have Haven send SMS notifications to your normal phone on intrusion events, instead of using Signal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re going to be gone for a long period of time, you might need to keep your Haven phone plugged in so that it doesn’t run out of battery and power off. This means you can’t keep your laptop and Haven phone in a hotel safe for too long before the battery dies. But, considering hotel safes are not very secure, it’s not too different to just leave your laptop and Haven phone on the desk or bedside table, plugged in.</p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is the the security of your Haven phone itself.</p>\n<p>A clever attacker who knows that you’re using Haven could jam the wifi, mobile data, and SMS wireless frequencies, preventing Haven from sending you notifications. The attacker could then attempt to access the phone to delete the local evidence logs from the device as well.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it’s important to lock down your Haven phone. Lock your phone with a strong passcode or password, and make sure your phone is encrypted. You can change your lockscreen and security settings from the Settings app. Also, install all updates for Android and for all of your apps, and turn off all radios that you aren’t using, like bluetooth and NFC. If you can, use mobile data and turn off wifi as well. This will reduce the attack surface of the phone, making it more difficult for an attacker to hack it once they’ve entered your room.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><span> Rutkowska said she “absolutely” believes there is a need for technology like Haven, and suggested that the developers add “a hearbeat signal… for remote logging.” That would help warn users when the device loses a network connection, for example due to signal jamming. She also thinks most users will disable real-time notifications because “getting lots of Signal messages is annoying” — better to have a log that can be consulted later. To protect it from tampering, such a log could be cryptographically signed. It could also be pushed to a remote location, like a git version-control repository running on a distant server.<br>\n</span></p>\n<p>If an attacker can both jam your Haven phone’s radio signals and also hack into it to delete the evidence of intrusion, it’s possible for them to then still do an evil maid attack on your laptop without getting caught. However, Haven makes such an attack considerably more expensive, with less certainty of success, than if all they had to deal with was tampering with your laptop.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Haven can only monitor for intrusions if you actually use it. During my time testing it, more than once I positioned my Haven phone in the right place, made sure it was connected to wifi so I could get notifications, and plugged in so the battery wouldn’t die, but then forgot to actually activate the app. Several hours later when I returned to my room and found the Haven phone deactivated, I had no way of knowing if an intrusion occurred or not.</p>\n<p>Finally, Haven is still in early development. There are still kinks that need to be worked out, plenty of bugs that need to be fixed, and plenty of features that would make it more useful and more reliable. There are false positives; once, I came back to find over 80 intrusion alerts, all of them the sounds of loud cars or sirens driving by my Manhattan hotel room. And sometimes, actual events don’t get logged when they should — I ran into issues where camera motion events weren’t getting triggered at all on my device, but that bug has been resolved for me now. It would be prudent to wait for the Haven app to mature before relying on it in high security situations.</p>\n<p>But even now, it’s much better than leaving your laptop exposed to physical attacks without any monitoring while you’re heading out for drinks after a long day at a conference.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/snowdens-new-app-uses-your-smartphone-to-physically-guard-your-laptop/\">Edward Snowden’s New App Uses Your Smartphone to Physically Guard Your Laptop</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>On Thursday, a</u> jury acquitted six defendants charged with felonies stemming from their arrests at protests surrounding Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. The acquittal is a blow to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia: a jury rebuke in the first tranche of 194 defendants the government is seeking to collectively punish for the acts of a handful of individuals.</p>\n<p>Supporters gathered outside the courthouse to meet the defendants as they left the building, holding a banner that read, “Love for all who resist.” When a group of four jurors exited the courthouse, demonstrators recognized them and cheered.</p>\n<p>The defendants had been arrested in Washington on Inauguration Day when police corralled more than 200 people, many of them demonstrating under the banner of “DisruptJ20.” The government eventually charged hundreds of people in connection with a small amount of property damage committed by a few individuals. Prosecutors sought to use a novel approach to group liability in the case to charge the defendants with an array of crimes — a tactic critics of the prosecution have said runs the risk of criminalizing dissent and poses a threat to the First Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">“This is a demonstration that the jury didn’t buy the prosecution’s absurd theory of the case.”</blockquote>\n<p>“This is a demonstration that the jury didn’t buy the prosecution’s absurd theory of the case,” said Sam Menefee-Libey, of the Dead City Legal Posse, which is providing legal support to defendants. Menefee-Libey, who has served as a de facto spokesperson for the J20 defendants, added, “This is a big win for these six defendants and a big relief to everyone else who’s still fighting.”</p>\n<p>In a statement, the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office made no indication that it intended to drop charges. “We appreciate the jury’s close examination of the individual conduct and intent of each defendant during this trial and respect its verdict,” said the statement. “In the remaining pending cases, we look forward to the same rigorous review for each defendant.”</p>\n<p>Although the jury had lots of careful discussion over the past three days, a juror who only gave his name as Steve told the media collective <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UR_Ninja/status/943902452599881728\">Unicorn Riot</a> it was not ultimately a close call. “The prosecution admitted the morning of day one that they would present no evidence that any of the defendants committed any acts of violence or vandalism,” Steve said. “From that point, before the defense ever uttered a sound, it was clear to me that ultimately we would find everyone not guilty.”</p>\n<p>The jury’s decision heartened those still facing charges — even as they steeled themselves for more battles ahead. “I think most defendants are feeling vindicated right now,” said one defendant who, still facing charges, asked for anonymity to speak frankly. “What’s frustrating is it took these acquittals to prove to everybody the abuses we’ve endured for a year. From the moment of Trump’s inauguration, we were tortured by police, terrorized by the prosecutors, stalked by the ‘alt-right,’ vilified in the press and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/17/j20-inauguration-protest-trump-riot-first-amendment/\">alienated from friends and family</a>.”</p>\n<p>Instead of presenting evidence that any of the six personally engaged in property destruction, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff argued that by showing up to the march in black, moving through the streets with the group, and chanting anti-capitalist slogans, the defendants had willfully associated with a “riot.” The government charged the six with misdemeanor rioting, misdemeanor conspiracy to riot, and five felony counts of property destruction, charges which carry a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The jury acquitted all six defendants, including photojournalist Alexei Wood, nurse Britt Lawson, Jennifer Armento, Oliver Harris, Michelle “Miel” Macchio, and Christina Simmons, on all the charges.</p>\n<p>Menefee-Libey and other J20 supporters are renewing their call on the Trump administration to drop the charges against the remaining 188 defendants. The next trial of seven J20 defendants on three misdemeanor charges — rioting, conspiracy to riot, and one count of property destruction — has no scheduled trial date, but D.C. Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz will hold a status hearing on January 19. The next tranche of defendants facing the same felony and misdemeanor charges as those acquitted today is scheduled for March 5.</p>\n<p><div><br>\n<a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/J20-pepper-spray-1513893780.jpg\"><img alt=\"TOPSHOT - Police officers pepper spray a group of protestors before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Throughout the day, protesters suffered <a href=\"https://policecomplaints.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/office%20of%20police%20complaints/publication/attachments/Inaguration%20Protest%20Monitoring%20Report%20FINAL.pdf\">abuses</a> at the hands of the Metropolitan Police Department. Police indiscriminately pepper-sprayed crowds of protesters with Super Soaker-like dispensers. Riot cops flung stinger grenades into crowds of marchers, journalists, and legal observers. Some 234 people — among them those who were eventually charged in the J20 trials — were caught in a police line and arrested, despite <a href=\"https://policecomplaints.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/police%20complaints/publication/attachments/first_amendment_act.pdf\">local law</a> in Washington specifically discouraged the use of the controversial mass arrest technique, known as a kettling.\n<p>The arrestees were <a href=\"https://www.acludc.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/001_horse_cmpt.pdf\">trapped</a> in the kettle for as much as nine hours, pushed against each other, and covered in painful pepper spray. They were denied food, water, and access to bathrooms. Those arrested included protesters, medics, legal observers, and some journalists. A handful were let go. Most were charged with a single count of felony rioting. Over 130 defendants signed on to “points of unity,” which insisted on the political nature of the charges and refused to accept cooperating pleas. When the majority of the defendants refused to plea, the U.S. attorney’s office returned a superseding indictment which charged 212 defendants with eight felonies, carrying a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison.</p>\n<p>In the following months, some of those charges were reduced to misdemeanors and a few were dismissed. But the defendants in this case continued to face 50 years in prison for attending a protest — until today.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">Liberal jurisprudence is supposed to hold as a fundamental value that individuals are responsible for their own concerted acts.</blockquote>\n<p>At every step of this prosecution, critics have said, the government has relied on undermining core principles of the American justice system that posit individualized suspicion and individualized punishment. Instead of identifying and arresting the handful of individuals breaking windows, the police indiscriminately arrested a crowd. Instead of individually charging those who engaged in criminal behavior, the state charged some 212 people — holding the entire group responsible for the acts committed by a select few. Yet liberal jurisprudence is supposed to hold as a fundamental value that individuals are responsible for their own concerted acts.</p>\n<p>“Today’s verdict reaffirms two central constitutional principles of our democracy: first, that dissent is not a crime, and second, that our justice system does not permit guilt by association,” said Scott Michelman, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Washington, D.C., chapter, in a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-dc-applauds-jury-verdict-inauguration-day-protestor-criminal-trials\">statement</a> applauding the verdict. “We hope today’s verdict begins the important work of teaching police and prosecutors to respect the line between lawbreaking and constitutionally protected protest.”</p>\n<p>If the prosecution’s theory of the case had prevailed, it would have signaled that anyone who attends a protest at which criminal behavior takes place can be held responsible for that behavior — even if they did nothing but express their beliefs.</p>\n<p>The acquittal is a vindication of the defendants’ decision to fight the charges as a group and refuse to submit to pleas, which by acknowledging guilt, undermine the message that these charges were politically motivated and unjust from the start. Menefee-Libey said, “This is what solidarity, perseverance, showing up for one another, bravery, and collective legal defense get us.”</p>\n<p>Still, more legal battles loom for the nearly 200 remaining J20 defendants. “The challenge going forward will be to ensure that everybody else walks free, even the alleged window-breakers,” said the defendant who spoke anonymously with The Intercept. “A conviction for any defendant, no matter how allegedly culpable of vandalism, will send a signal that this whole fascist effort by the state and their auxiliaries in the far right was worth it. We can’t let them do that.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: An anti-Trump protester holds her hands up as police officers lineup in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/j20-trial-acquitted-inauguration-day-protest/\">Jury Acquits First Six J20 Defendants, Rebuking Government’s Push for Collective Punishment</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>A district judge</u> in Las Vegas has granted a new trial for Kirstin Blaise Lobato, who was convicted of murdering a homeless man and amputating his penis. The 55-page ruling by Judge Stefany Miley, released December 19, offers a solid chance for Lobato to finally prove she was wrongly convicted of the crime.</p>\n<p>Lobato has been in prison for more than 11 years for the grisly murder of 44-year-old Duran Bailey, whose beaten and bloodied body was discovered partially disrobed, his mutilated groin wrapped in plastic, behind a dumpster just off the city’s famed Strip around 10 p.m. on July 8, 2001.</p>\n<p>The crime scene was ripe with evidence, none of which linked Lobato to the slaying. But instead of mining the evidence or focusing on likely suspects, police detectives <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/03/12/murderinvegas/\">relied on a third-hand rumor</a> to target Lobato, a stranger to Bailey, for the crime. Lobato even had a solid alibi: The day that Bailey was murdered she was at her parents’ home in Panaca, a small town near the Utah border nearly three hours northeast of Vegas.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors conceded that she was in Panaca for most of that day, but argued that Lobato had been in Vegas in the wee hours of July 8 when she came across Bailey, who she savagely beat and murdered before hopping in her Pontiac Fiero and blazing a trail up an unlit, two-lane mountainous state highway for home. Under the state’s convoluted theory, Lobato made it home so quickly that she was seen goofing off around the neighborhood on a four-wheeler late that morning.</p>\n<p>Although ludicrous, the state received significant help in peddling its lame tale via the Clark County medical examiner, Lary Simms, who autopsied Bailey’s body and came up with an estimated time of death. Though his original opinion would all but exclude Lobato from committing the crime, by the time he testified at her 2006 trial, he had widened the time-of-death window just enough to allow the prosecutors to charge Lobato with the crime. It worked.</p>\n<p>The defense did little to counter the state’s convenient time-of-death determination — an issue that Lobato raised in an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court. Lobato argued that her lawyers should have called a forensic pathologist or entomologist to narrow Bailey’s time of death and that their failure to do so rendered their counsel constitutionally deficient. In support of her position, Lobato included affidavits from several bug scientists who strongly challenged Simms’s estimation.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a lower court should fully vet her claim. Lobato’s alibi evidence was strong, the court concluded, so if her scientific evidence was credible, it would certainly cause a jury to doubt her guilt, they reasoned. Bailey’s time of death was “a crucial aspect” of the case.</p>\n<p>Over a week in October, that hearing was held in Miley’s courtroom in downtown Las Vegas. Represented by lawyers from the Innocence Project, Lobato presented strong evidence that the state’s time-of-death estimation was off by hours. According to three distinguished forensic entomologists presented by Lobato’s lawyers, there was no way that Bailey’s bloody body had been left outside all day in the Vegas heat before being found. Had he been he would have been covered with blowfly eggs — nature’s ubiquitous first responders to scenes of death. But there was no such evidence on his body, leading them each to conclude that Bailey was killed sometime around sunset that evening, after the blowflies had wrapped up their work for the day.</p>\n<p>Given that entomology is based on centuries of research and knowledge, it would be hard to argue with the scientists’ conclusions, but that <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/25/kirstin-lobato-murder-trial-las-vegas/\">didn’t stop prosecutor Sandra DiGiacomo</a> from giving it a shot. The scientists hadn’t studied blowfly activity in Las Vegas, she argued, so they couldn’t actually say what the local blowflies would or would not do. And, she argued, it just so happens that in Las Vegas, not every dead body attracts flies — even though she had scant evidence to support her claim. In short, DiGiacomo’s defense of Lobato’s conviction was that in Vegas blowflies are exceptionally picky.</p>\n<p>DiGiacomo was fairly flat-footed during the hearing. She called just two witnesses, a doctor and a scientist she’d contacted only weeks before the hearing. And she didn’t even have Simms to help. In response to questions from The Intercept for our <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/03/12/murderinvegas/\">investigation</a> of Lobato’s case back in 2015, Simms reversed course, saying that his first time of death estimation, which would preclude Lobato from having committed the crime, was his best estimation. And he said he hadn’t seen any entomology reports, but that if the science was credible, he would revise his estimate even more, pushing it to late afternoon. In short, before DiGiacomo even made it to Miley’s courtroom, the state’s case against Lobato had fallen apart.</p>\n<p>Miley has granted Lobato a new trial and has set a meeting with the lawyers for January 24, 2018, to discuss a trial date. But whether that will even happen is unclear. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has essentially three options: He can appeal Miley’s ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court, he can move forward with a new trial, or he can dismiss the case and set Lobato free.</p>\n<p>Given that the Nevada Supreme Court has strongly and unanimously signaled that it believes Lobato’s alibi is credible, it would seem folly to try to enlist them to overturn Miley’s decision. If Wolfson were to opt to take the case to trial again, it would actually be the third time the office would pursue a prosecution of Lobato. She was first tried and convicted in 2002, but that conviction was overturned because the trial judge had improperly allowed prosecutors to introduce unreliable snitch testimony into evidence. Lobato was retried in 2006 and again lost, but now that conviction has also been tanked. Even more notable is that this time, the state’s entire case against Lobato has been dismantled, leaving Wolfson exactly zero evidence to offer of her guilt. That leaves the third option: dismissing the case. To Michelle Ravell, Lobato’s most loyal and ardent advocate, the third option is the only just option. “The only reasonable and fair option is No. 3,” she said. “Their job is to seek justice; so, do that. It’s so obvious she is innocent. Do the right thing and let her go already. I want to see her nightmare end.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Kirstin Lobato and her defense team at Clark County Courthouse for a hearing on Oct. 12, 2017.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/kirstin-blaise-lobato-las-vegas-homeless-penis-murder/\">Las Vegas Penis Murder Conviction Overturned</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

(Mulvaney helpfully noted to the staff that he is “known by his last name, ‘Galkowski.'”)</p>\n<p>Eric Blankenstein, a lawyer coming from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, is also part of the new team, as is Brian Johnson, a staffer at the House Financial Services Committee, chaired by hard-line CFPB opponent Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas.</p>\n<p>Sheila Greenwood, an official at Ben Carson’s Department of Housing and Urban Development, has also been detailed to the CFPB, Mulvaney told the staff.</p>\n<p>Greenwood, Johnson, and Blankenstein will work at the CFPB on a full-time basis. The others will, like Mulvaney, split their time between the agency and their jobs in the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump named Mulvaney as acting director of the CFPB despite the succession plan set up by Congress, which would have the deputy director assume the duties in the case of a vacancy. Leandra English, who was deputy under former CFPB Director Richard Cordray, has challenged Trump’s appointment in court. Mulvaney’s proposal earlier this month to embed political staffers throughout the agency was <a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/mulvaneys-plan-to-embed-political-staffers-in-cfpb-sparks-backlash\">met with an uproar</a>.</p>\n<p>The president won the first round of the legal battle, but the case remains pending, and Trump’s continuing takeover of the agency leaves little room to continue to call it independent.

Por outro lado, vemos o levante de uma periferia urbana e rural desiludida politicamente, marginalizada culturalmente e que se sente traída economicamente, mas em ebulição e com poder e voz como nunca se viu.

        "content": "<p><u>So, which side</u> are you on? #TeamWest or #TeamCoates?</p>\n<p>Choose fast, preferably within seconds, and don’t come to this gunfight with a knife. No, like some nerdy Rambo, we want you greased up and loaded with ammo: your most painful character smears, your most “gotcha” evidence of past political infractions, a blitzkrieg of hyperlinks and, of course, an aircraft carrier of reaction GIFs.</p>\n<p>That’s pretty much how the online debate has played out ever since Cornel West published his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/ta-nehisi-coates-neoliberal-black-struggle-cornel-west\">piece in The Guardian</a> challenging Ta-Nehisi Coates, an article you either regard as an outrageous injustice or an earth-shattering truth bomb, depending on which team you have chosen.</p>\n<p>We see it differently. We see this debate as a political opportunity, one that has far less to do with either of these brilliant men and everything to do with how, at a time of unfathomably high stakes, we are going to build a multiracial human rights movement capable of beating back surging white supremacy and rapidly concentrating corporate power. As women, both Black and white, both American and Canadian, we see the question like this: What are the duties of radicals and progressives inside relatively wealthy countries to the world beyond our national borders? A warming world wracked by expanding and unending wars that our governments wage, finance, and arm — a world scarred by unbearable poverty and forced migration?</p>\n<p>Though West directed his criticisms at Coates, these are by no means questions for Coates alone. They are urgent challenges for all of us who see ourselves as part of social movements and intellectual traditions that yearn for a world where justice and dignity abound.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">What are the duties of radicals and progressives inside relatively wealthy countries to the world beyond our national borders?</blockquote>\n<p>So before this goes any further, let’s yank this fight away from the poisonous terrain on which it is currently unfolding — that of two famous men with healthy egos duking it out while the Twitterverse divides into warring camps — and instead dig into the substance.</p>\n<p>Let’s also take it as a given that West’s piece was flawed and painted Coates with too broad a brush. It accuses him of silence on some subjects where he has, in fact, been vocal (like the financial sector’s role in entrenching Black poverty). And as the New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jelani9/status/942582514245304320\">pointed out</a>, the man who has done more to revive the debate about Black reparations than any writer of his generation cannot blithely be written off as a neoliberal tool.</p>\n<p>But that does not change the fact that West raises crucial points when he critiques Coates for having too little to say about the impact of U.S. military and economic policies abroad, for failing to place U.S. experiences in a broader context of U.S. imperial power, and for casting Barack Obama as the continuation of the legacy of Malcolm X (whom West describes as “the greatest prophetic voice against the American Empire,” while Obama is “the first Black head of the American Empire”).</p>\n<p>Where we differ is that we don’t think these criticisms apply just (or even especially) to Coates. Nor do we think this debate should be viewed as an exclusively Black discussion, as some have argued (which is why we decided to write this together). Rather, these questions about our relationship to empire and transnational capital are ones that every progressive movement and intellectual across North America should urgently confront, and we are convinced that if we do, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>To be clear, we are not saying that every writer has a duty to write about everything. No one does. Nor do we think that the subject matter for which Coates is known — Black life in the United States — is somehow insufficient. It isn’t. And yet hard questions remain that cannot be dismissed simply become some dislike the messenger or the form of the message.</p>\n<p>Such as: Is it even possible to be a voice for transformational change without a clear position on the brutal wars and occupations waged with U.S. weapons? Is it possible to have a credible critique of Wall Street’s impact on Black and other vulnerable communities in the U.S. without reckoning with the predatory and neocolonial impacts of the global financial system (including Washington-based institutions like the International Monetary Fund) on the debt-laden economies of African countries?</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\"> Is it even possible to be a voice for transformational change without a clear position on the brutal wars and occupations waged with U.S. weapons?</blockquote>\n<p>Even when our work is primarily focused nationally or hyperlocally, as it is for most organizers and writers, there is still a pressing need for an internationalist conception of power to inform our analysis. This is not a contradiction. In fact, it used to be foundational to all major radical and progressive movements, from the socialist internationals to Pan-Africanism and the global campaign to end apartheid in South Africa, from the “alter-globalization” movement to the international women’s movement. All understood that resistance needed to be global in order to win. Marcus Garvey, for instance, drew ideas and inspiration for Black liberation from the <a href=\"http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.ca/2013/03/marcus-garvey-irish-connection.html\">Irish</a> struggle for independence. And Malcolm X famously <a href=\"http://www.aaihs.org/malcolm-x-and-anti-imperialist-thought/\">observed</a> that when racial minorities in the U.S. saw their struggle in a global context, they had the empowering realization that they were, in fact, part of a broad and powerful majority.</p>\n<p>We are not saying that this internationalist tradition is entirely absent in contemporary North American movements — there have been Black activist delegations to Colombia, Brazil, and Palestine in recent years. The climate justice movement is linked to frontline fights against fossil fuel extraction in every corner of the globe. And the immigrant rights movement is internationalist by definition. So are parts of the movement confronting sexual violence. We could go on.</p>\n<p>But it is also true that the atmosphere of intense political crisis in the United States is breeding a near myopic insularity among progressives and even some self-described radicals, one that is not just morally dangerous but strategically shortsighted. By defining our work exclusively as what goes on inside our borders, and losing touch with the rich anti-imperialist tradition, we risk depriving our movements of the revolutionary power that flows from cross-border exchanges of both wisdom and tactics.</p>\n<p>For instance, if U.S. President Donald Trump is seen in isolation from the rise of far-right forces around the world, we lose opportunities to learn from people in Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines, South Africa, India, Turkey, and Togo about how they are resisting their various strongmen. Because if we have learned anything over the past years of left-wing setbacks and disappointments, from Syriza in Greece to Maduro in Venezuela to the dashed dreams of the Arab Spring, it should be that the forces shaping national destinies are global. International lenders, Western military support for despots, or even a sudden drop in oil prices can all thwart or derail a liberation project that has defined itself too narrowly.</p>\n<p>Which is why it’s high time to change the subject from West vs. Coates, and begin the much more salient debate about what we <em>all</em> can do to rediscover the power of a genuinely internationalist, anti-imperialist worldview. A power that our movement ancestors well understood.</p>\n<p>Because there is simply no way to fight for a world in which Black lives truly matter without reckoning with the global forces that allow Black lives to disappear under waves in the Mediterranean, or to be mutilated and enslaved in countries like Libya, or to be snuffed out by debt imposed by Washington-based financial institutions.</p>\n<p>The same is true of climate change, which is hitting people in the global south first and worst. It has been reported that of the <a href=\"https://maplecroft.com/portfolio/new-analysis/2014/10/29/climate-change-and-lack-food-security-multiply-risks-conflict-and-civil-unrest-32-countries-maplecroft/\">top 10 nations</a> most impacted by climate change, six are on the continent of Africa. Similarly, there is no way to fight for the full funding of public schools and free universal health care inside the United States without confronting the vastly expanding share of the budget that goes to feeding the war machine.</p>\n<p>The immigrant rights movement is the most internationalist of our movements, but we still need to do more to connect the dots between rights and justice for migrants within countries like the United States and Canada, and the drivers of migration in places like Mexico and Ghana, whether it is pro-corporate trade and economic policies that destabilize domestic industries, or U.S.-backed wars, or drought deepened by climate change.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">Our movements simply cannot afford to stick to our various comfort zones or offload internationalism as someone else’s responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p>The unending misery in Haiti may be the most vivid illustration of how today’s crises are all interrelated. On the island, serial natural disasters, some linked to climate change, are being layered on top of illegitimate foreign debts and coupled with gross negligence by the international aid industry, as well as acute U.S.-lead efforts to destabilize and under-develop the country. These compounding forces have led tens of thousands of Haitians to migrate to the United States in recent years, where they come face-to-face with Trump’s anti-Black, anti-immigrant agenda. Many are now fleeing to Canada, where  hundreds if not thousands could face deportation. We can’t pry these various cross-border crises apart, nor should we.</p>\n<p>In short, there is no radicalism — Black or otherwise — that ends at the national boundaries of our countries, especially the wealthiest and most heavily armed nation on earth. From the worldwide reach of the financial sector to the rapidly expanding battlefield of U.S. Special Operations to the fact that carbon pollution respects no borders, the forces we are all up against are global. So, too, are the crises we face, from the rise of white supremacy, ethno-chauvinism, and authoritarian strongmen to the fact that more people are being forced from their homes than at any point since World War II. If our movements are to succeed, we will need both analysis and strategies that reflect these truths about our world.</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Some argue for staying in our lane, and undoubtedly there is a place for deep expertise. The political reality, however, is that the U.S. government doesn’t stay in its lane and never has — it spends public dollars using its military and economic might to turn the world into a battlefield, and it does so in the name of all of U.S. citizens.</span></p>\n<p>As a result, our movements simply cannot afford to stick to our various comfort zones or offload internationalism as someone else’s responsibility. To do so would be grossly negligent of our geopolitical power, our own agency, as well as our very real connections to people and places throughout the world. So when we build cross-sector alliances and cross-issue solidarity, those relationships cannot be confined to our own nations or even our own hemisphere — not in a world as interconnected as ours. We have to strive for them to be as global as the forces we are up against.</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We know this can seem overwhelming at a time when so many domestic crises are coming to a head and so many of us are being pushed beyond the breaking point. But it is worth remembering that our movement ancestors formed international alliances and placed their struggles within a global narrative not out of a sense of guilt or obligation, but because they understood that it made them stronger and more likely to win at home — and that strength terrified their enemies. </span></p>\n<p>Besides, the benefit of building a broad-based, multiracial social movement — which should surely be the end goal of all serious organizers and radical intellectuals — is that movements can have a division of labor, with different specialists focusing on different areas, united by broad agreement about overall vision and goals. That’s what a real movement looks like.</p>\n<p>The good news is that grassroots internationalism has never been easier. From cellphones to social media, we have opportunities to speak with one another across borders that our predecessors couldn’t have dreamed of. Similarly, tools that allow migrant families to stay connected with loved ones in different countries can also become conduits for social movements to hear news that the corporate media ignores. We are able, for instance, to learn about the pro-democracy movements growing in strength across the continent of Africa, as well as efforts to stop extrajudicial killings in countries like Brazil. Many would not have known that Black African migrants are being <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/specials/africa/libya-slave-auctions\">enslaved in Libya</a> if it had not been for these same tools. And had they not known they wouldn’t have been able to engage in acts of necessary <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/africa/libya-migrants-slavery.html\">solidarity</a>.</p>\n<p>So let’s leave narrow, nostalgic nationalism to Donald Trump and his delusional #MAGA supporters. The forces waging war on bodies and the planet are irreversibly global, and we are vastly stronger when we build global movements capable of confronting them at every turn.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Cornel West, left, professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary, speaks at the National Press Club on Feb. 21, 2017 in Washington, D.C.

Without it, Republicans will need to find the votes to keep the government open on their own.</p>\n<p>Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi told The Intercept that Democrats are whipping their members to vote against the continuing resolution.</p>\n<p>CHIP is a decades-old, federally funded program that makes health insurance available to families whose incomes are modest, but too high to qualify for Medicaid. It’s long had strong bipartisan support, providing coverage to almost 9 million kids and 370,000 pregnant women.</p>\n<p>“This may go down as the worst year for children in Congress in decades,” said Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a children’s advocacy group. “We are distraught for the families and nearly 9 million children who rely on CHIP for their health care. This action shows Congress’s failure to prioritize and protect children and a very popular and successful program. It needlessly leaves states and families left in limbo.”</p>\n<p><span>Whether Democrats would refuse to vote on a continuing resolution that extends CHIP funding for only three months remains unclear. In a</span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000160-2734-d0c8-a9eb-2ff71c200000\"><span> Politico-Harvard poll</span></a><span> released this month, Democratic voters said CHIP is their top legislative priority. Another</span> <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/171117_crosstabs_POLITICO_v1_AP-2.pdf\"><span>Morning Consult/Politico poll</span></a><span> showed that when voters were asked if CHIP reauthorization was important enough to prompt a government shutdown, 42 percent answered “yes definitely” and 25 percent answered “yes, maybe.” Among Democrats, 53 percent answered “yes definitely” and 24 percent answered “yes, maybe.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The stakes for kids and expectant mothers are already sky-high. In a </span><a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2017/12/20/new-report-on-chip-funding-delay-shows-2-million-kids-may-lose-coverage-in-january/\"><span>report</span></a><span> released yesterday, researchers at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families found that if Congress does not reauthorize CHIP soon, about 1.9 million children could lose health insurance coverage in January. Several states, including Utah, Connecticut, and Virginia, have already sent out notices to inform CHIP enrollees that their coverage could end January 31. Georgetown researchers report that another 1 million children are at risk of losing their coverage by the end of February.</span></p>\n<p><span>Earlier this week, Alabama’s CHIP director </span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/20/childrens-health-insurance-chip-lose-coverage-congress-249584\"><span>announced</span></a><span> that unless Congress acts soon, the state plans to freeze CHIP enrollment on January 1. (There are currently 84,000 children enrolled in the state, who also stand to lose coverage by the end of January.) History reveals that even temporary enrollment freezes can lead</span><a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2017/10/25/what-are-the-consequences-of-congressional-delay-on-chip/\"> <span>to major drops in coverage</span></a><span>. Arizona’s enrollment fell by more than 60 percent when the state temporarily froze the program in 2009, and North Carolina’s enrollment fell by nearly 30 percent when it froze CHIP for 10 months in 2001. </span></p>\n<p><span>Colorado, which is also set to end its CHIP program at the end of January if Congress doesn’t reauthorize funding, </span><a href=\"http://publicnewsservice.org/2017-12-20/childrens-issues/childrens-health-insurance-funding-nears-end-in-colorado/a60728-1\"><span>has informed pregnant women</span></a><span> who are scheduled to give birth in February that their health insurance will expire before they deliver. </span></p>\n<p><span>Erin Miller, the vice president of health initiatives with the Colorado Children’s Campaign told Public News Service that lapses in CHIP coverage could be financially devastating for families. “If they have a lapse in coverage and say their kid has asthma, and that kid can’t get their meds, has to go to the emergency room and ends up admitted – that possible admission would cost them everything they have,” she said. </span></p>\n<p>Top photo: TC Bell sits with his two daughters Dagny, 8, and Emma, 4, before they get dressed for school, at their home in Denver on Nov. 28, 2017.

        "content": "<p><span><u>Depois de muitas</u> idas e vindas, 14 de dezembro foi enfim um dia de decisão em Brasília: o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia, confirmou que a votação da reforma da Previdência ficou para fevereiro de 2018, o que praticamente decretou o </span><a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/resumo-do-dia/noticia/quinta-feira-14-de-dezembro-de-2017.ghtml\" target=\"_blank\"><span>fim das atividades no Legislativo</span></a><span>. Neste mesmo dia 14, no entanto, o Senado aprovou um belo presente de Natal para o agronegócio: o Programa de Regularização Tributária Rural (PRR). O projeto de lei, que aguarda a sanção do presidente Michel Temer nos próximos dias, concede uma isenção bilionária a devedores do Funrural (Fundo de Assistência ao Trabalhador Rural), um imposto aplicado sobre o comércio da produção agrícola. </span></p>\n<p>Os valores arrecadados por este tributo vão exatamente para os cofres do sistema geral de aposentadoria dos trabalhadores, aquele que o governo diz estar tentando salvar com a reforma.</p>\n<p>Entre deputados e senadores ruralistas, o discurso principal foi dizer que o projeto seria um benefício principalmente para pequenos produtores endividados. Os maiores beneficiados, no entanto, tendem a ser outros. Dados da Procuradoria-Geral da Fazenda Nacional (PGFN), obtidos com exclusividade por The Intercept Brasil por meio da Lei de Acesso à Informação, revelam que gigantes do agronegócio estão no topo da lista de inscritos na Dívida Ativa do Funrural (cujos prazos de pagamento foram todos esgotados).</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"> Com a aprovação do projeto no Senado é que os devedores poderão parcelar seus débitos em suaves 176 parcelas. E mais: ficam isentos de multas, juros e encargos.</blockquote>\n<p>A líder do ranking é ela, a JBS, pivô de um dos maiores <a href=\"http://epoca.globo.com/economia/noticia/2017/10/nova-planilha-da-jbs-lista-64-politicos-e-cita-temer.html\" target=\"_blank\">escândalos de corrupção</a> no país em 2017. Até agosto deste ano, a empresa tinha um débito de R$393,7 milhões. Em segundo lugar na lista, aparece a Tinto Holding LTDA, com R$ 329,5 milhões. A empresa, controladora do frigorífico Bertin, <a href=\"https://www.jota.info/tributario/carf-ve-fraude-fiscal-durante-fusao-da-bertin-com-a-jbs-11042017\" target=\"_blank\">se fundiu em 2009</a> com a JBS. Ou seja, juntas, as firmas ligadas aos irmãos Batista possuem em Dívida Ativa nada menos do que R$ 723,3 milhões em débitos com o Funrural. O pulo do gato com a aprovação do projeto no Senado é que os devedores poderão parcelar seus débitos em suaves 176 parcelas. E mais: ficam isentos de multas, juros e encargos. Só no caso da Tinto Holding e da JBS, se elas aderirem ao PRR, isso representará um desconto de R$ 225 milhões junto à PGFN.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/Funrural/funrural?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes\"><b>Acesse aqui a tabela das dívidas com o Funrural</b></a></p>\n<p>Ao todo, até agosto deste ano, a soma de todos os valores inscritos em Dívida Ativa do Funrural chegou a R$ 17,6 bilhões. Com a isenção de multas, encargos e juros prevista no projeto de lei aprovado pelo Senado, os devedores que aderirem ao programa de regularização podem ser beneficiados com um desconto total de pouco mais de R$ 4,1 bilhões.</p>\n<p><span>O </span><a href=\"http://www25.senado.leg.br/web/atividade/materias/-/materia/131950\" target=\"_blank\"><span>projeto de lei 165 </span></a><span>de 2017 é de autoria do deputado Zé Silva (SD-MG). Em maio deste ano, o parlamentar foi citado na delação de Ricardo Saud, executivo da J&amp;F, controladora da JBS, como beneficiário de R$ 200 mil em espécie na campanha eleitoral de 2014. À época, Zé Silva refutou as acusações. Tanto o deputado quanto a JBS foram procurados, mas não responderam até o fechamento desta reportagem.</span></p>\n<p>Além de prever o parcelamento e a isenção de multas, o texto aprovado determina ainda a redução das atuais alíquotas de cobrança do Funrural. No caso de pessoa física, caso seja sancionado e se torne lei, a cobrança em cima da receita do comércio da produção será de 1,2% em vez dos atuais 2,1%. Para empresas, passará para 1,7% em vez dos atuais 2,5%. Uma curiosidade é que, numa época em que o governo fala tanto em aperto na Previdência, vislumbra dar descontos num tributo que é voltado exatamente para o sistema geral de aposentadoria. Apesar de ter sido criado na década de 1970 especificamente para o setor rural, mais recentemente o imposto voltou-se para os cofres da Previdência geral dos trabalhadores.</p>\n<h3><b>Mais frigoríficos e a usina de um político</b></h3>\n<p><span>No topo dos devedores, há outro gigante frigorífico: o grupo Marfrig. Juntas, a Marfrig Global Foods e a MFB Marfrig Frigoríficos Brasil possuem R$ 321,7 milhões em dívidas com a Procuradoria da Fazenda. Em julho deste ano, a empresa foi citada na</span><a href=\"https://veja.abril.com.br/politica/cui-bono-entenda-operacao-que-levou-ex-ministro-geddel-a-prisao/#\" target=\"_blank\"><span> Operação Cui Bono</span></a><span> porque pode ter sido beneficiada por um empréstimo milionário da Caixa, conseguido sob a influência do ex-deputado Eduardo Cunha e do ex-ministro Geddel Vieira Lima, ambos atualmente presos.  </span></p>\n<p><span>A assessoria de imprensa da Marfrig afirmou que a empresa estudará até fevereiro do ano que vem a possibilidade de aderir ao programa de refinanciamento das dívidas com o Funrural. Sobre a Operação Cui Bono, disse que </span><span>“se trata de uma questão antiga, já investigada e esclarecida pela empresa às autoridades”.</span></p>\n<p><span>Entre as principais devedoras, também estão muitas firmas já falidas, o que pode dificultar a cobrança dos atrasados pela União. É o caso da Laginha Agro Industrial, ligada ao Grupo João Lyra, pertencente ao ex-deputado federal por Alagoas. A empresa possui uma dívida com a PGFN de R$ 292 milhões. Individualmente, é o terceiro maior valor. Em quinto, com R$ 206,4 milhões aparece o Frigorífico Margen, também falido, que, em 2004, chegou a ter os sócios presos </span><a href=\"https://www2.senado.leg.br/bdsf/bitstream/handle/id/67755/noticia.htm?sequence=1\"><span>por suspeita de sonegação fiscal</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Até hotéis são devedores</b></h3>\n<p><span>O Funrural vinha sendo alvo de uma intensa disputa na Justiça, mas em março deste ano o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) </span><a href=\"http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=339602\" target=\"_blank\"><span>reconheceu a constitucionalidade</span></a><span> do imposto, o que deixou em polvorosa a bancada ruralista. Antes do projeto de lei aprovado pelo Senado, chegou a ser editada uma Medida Provisória, de autoria da deputada Tereza Cristina (sem partido-MS), que acabou caducando sem ser votado. Alguns trechos foram incorporados ao projeto de lei.  </span></p>\n<p>De acordo com o texto final que irá para a sanção de Temer, as dívidas até 30 de agosto deste ano poderão ser parceladas com as benesses estabelecidas. Os dados aos quais The Intercept Brasil teve acesso se referem à Dívida Ativa acumulada até o dia 1 de agosto. Os valores totais podem ser ainda maiores porque não levam em conta débitos cujo prazo para pagamento ainda está em andamento.</p>\n<p>Como a cobrança do tributo é feita em alguns casos em cima de quem compra a produção agrícola, a lista da Dívida Ativa do Funrural tem, por exemplo, 27 hotéis, com mais de R$ 122 milhões em valores atrasados. O maior devedor é a Rede Othon, com R$ 59,2 milhões, que não retornou os contatos para comentar se irá ou não aderir ao programa de refinanciamento.</p>\n<p>Ao todo, há 8.129 inscritos na lista da PGFN. Apenas 103 são produtores rurais individuais, sem CNPJ, inscritos no CEI (Cadastro Específico do INSS). Juntos, eles devem pouco mais de R$ 16 milhões.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/funrural-o-presente-de-natal-bilionario-para-a-jbs-e-o-agronegocio/\">Funrural: o presente de Natal bilionário para a JBS e o agronegócio</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

In the war in Yemen, at least two journalists were killed as a result of shelling fired by Houthi and Saleh militias, and at least two more journalists were injured in airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition.</p>\n<p>The third worst country was Mexico, with at least six people murdered in relation to their reporting. This includes several high-profile journalists, such as <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-journalist-murders-20170323-story.html\">Miroslava Breach</a> and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/15/the-murder-of-mexican-journalists-points-to-u-s-role-in-fueling-drug-war-violence/\">Javier Valdez Cárdenas</a>. According to Radsch, Mexican reporters’ deaths were usually linked to their coverage of corruption, drug cartels, and organized crime, but almost none of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. “It’s that combination of rampant murder and endemic impunity that causes a chilling effect throughout Mexico,” she added. (Other organizations have counted a higher number of journalists killed <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/mexico\">in Mexico</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-casualties/at-least-65-media-workers-killed-doing-their-jobs-in-2017-reporters-without-borders-idUSKBN1ED0WH\">globally</a>, due to their work, but Radsch says CPJ included only cases in which the connection to journalistic work was confirmed.)</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Javier-Valdez-Cardenas-1513802322.jpg\"><img alt=\"Journalists hold signs condemning violence against journalists while protesting the recent murder of the of Mexican journalist Javier Valdez on May 16, 2017 in Guadalajara.

While the historical average of women journalists killed is 7 percent, this year, it peaked at 19 percent. That may be because more women are covering dangerous beats and regions than in previous years, said Lauren Wolfe, an investigative journalist and the director of the Women’s Media Center’s Women Under Siege program.</p>\n<p>Women journalists face particular risks; for example, they are more likely to experience sexual assault and online harassment than their male colleagues. Wolfe said that often, those who are supposed to protect journalists, such as guards and drivers, can pose the biggest threats on the job.</p>\n<blockquote data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\">“The kinds of threats that women face are equally insidious and equally threatening to press freedom.”</blockquote>\n<p>Sexual abuse is surfacing as one of the biggest impediments to press freedom when it comes to women journalists, but CPJ does not track it in their annual reports — a limitation, in the eyes of Elisa Lees Muñoz, executive director of the International Women’s Media Foundation. “It doesn’t paint the full picture when you’re only monitoring murders and imprisonment and legal action, because the kinds of threats that women face are equally insidious and equally threatening to press freedom,” Muñoz told The Intercept.</p>\n<p>But Radsch from CPJ said it’s challenging to monitor incidents of sexual abuse, because, unlike imprisonment and murder, they are often not observed externally; it’s up to those who have undergone harassment to make it public.</p>\n<p>Even with the floodgates of the #MeToo moment wide open, women are reticent to talk about experiences of assault, for fear of backlash. For one, the issue still carries cultural and professional stigma. Muñoz highlighted how gender-based violence can lead newsrooms to take a patronizing approach, limiting the assignments available to women, and preventing them from advancing in their careers the ways men might.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen men who have been imprisoned go back on the job, we’ve seen men who had been kidnapped get hostile environment jobs. It doesn’t seem to impair their ability to report back at these environments, whereas women are automatically treated as having been damaged in some way and in need of protection,” she said.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/cjr-report-journalists-killed-2017-2-1513802317.jpg\"><img alt=\"TOPSHOT - The sons of murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia carry the coffin of their mother out of the church in Mosta, on November 3, 2017, after her funeral ceremony.

CPJ introduced a non-binary category to its database in addition to a male-female breakdown, but, so far, there are no available records reflecting the experiences of non-cisgender journalists.</p>\n<p>Both Wolfe and Muñoz suggested that hiring more women in higher management positions is one way to help newsrooms create a safer environment for female journalists. Other than that, Muñoz said that there has to be a culture in the newsroom that focuses on diversity as an objective in and of itself. “It just needs to be a priority,” she said. Newsrooms should “want to have women out there reporting, so that they are providing a diversity of views.”</p>\n<div><b>Correction: Dec. 21, 2017, 11:27 a.m.</b></div>\n<div><em>This story previously stated that 252 journalists were put behind bars for their reporting in 2017; in fact, it was 262.

The law was originally passed to legalize the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping under the Bush administration and serves as the basis for some of the NSA’s largest surveillance programs. Privacy activists have raised concerns about the massive amounts of Americans’ data swept up under the legal authority, and how law enforcement agencies can sift through much of it without a warrant.</p>\n<p>Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee spent much of the year working out a compromise reauthorization bill, which codified certain limits on 702 collection but stopped short of requiring a warrant to query the data for information on Americans. But the House Intelligence Committee passed its own version of the bill, which does not include those limits and <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/demandprogress/letters/Letter_In_Opposition_to_FISA_Amendments_Reauthorization_Act_of_2017.pdf\">may actually expand</a> the NSA’s authorities.</p>\n<p>Without explanation, the Intelligence Committee’s bill appeared on the Rules Committee <a href=\"https://rules.house.gov/bill/115/hr-4478\">website</a> Tuesday night, along with a last-minute amendment from Nunes.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told The Intercept over email that the flyer is a scare tactic and ignores the heart of the debate.</p>\n<p><span>“This is a total straw man. No one in Congress believes that Section 702 should be allowed to expire. The question is whether it should be reformed to prevent domestic spying on Americans,” said Goitein. “Congress should instead be voting on one of the actual reform proposals, not one of which would prevent surveillance of someone like Haji Iman.”</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes, R-Calif., speaks to reporters during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on March 22, 2017 in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/20/fisa-section-702-renewal-surveillance-bill/\">Republicans Circulate Flyer About ISIS While Rushing Opaque Surveillance Bill</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Washington is all</u> abuzz with rumors about the fate of Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to examine “any links and/or coordination” between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/politics/trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">some reporting</a>, Donald Trump’s allies believe he will have a “meltdown” and try to fire Mueller if the special counsel does not quickly wrap up the investigation and exonerate the president. (It <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/19/why-trump-cant-fire-mueller-at-least-not-directly/?utm_term=.83bef399ea23\">wouldn’t be a simple procedure</a> for Trump to get rid of Mueller, but if he’s determined to do so, he almost certainly can.) Meanwhile, elected Republicans and conservative news outlets are obsessively attacking Mueller in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/19/trump-russia-mueller-pardons-investigation-304125\">clear bid</a> to lay the groundwork for Trump to pardon any of his subordinates convicted on charges growing out of the Russia probe.</p>\n<p>But one thing’s for sure: If Trump does take some kind of outrageous action against Mueller, the Republican Party will mumble, look down at its shoes, and then do nothing whatsoever. Earlier this year there was momentum among <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/12/07/how-congress-can-protect-mueller-and-head-off-a-constitutional-crisis/?utm_term=.e3c8290241ba\">a small number of GOP lawmakers</a> to join with Democrats to pass legislation protecting Mueller, but that’s quietly petered out. There may be some opposition from some Republicans, but the odds of it being enough to stop Trump are quite low.</p>\n<p>If this occurs it should come as no surprise to anyone. It’s simply the logical endpoint of decades of effort by the Republican Party and its media penumbra to shield the GOP from the rule of law or any small-D democratic norms. Today’s GOP sees any and all rules just as billionaire New York real estate developer Leona Helmsley saw taxes – they’re only for “the little people.”</p>\n<p>There’s always been a significant faction of the U.S. right, rooted mostly in large corporations, that’s similar to the right in Latin America, in that it genuinely sees democracy as illegitimate. The success of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1930s was a gigantic shock to their system, and there were <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MeE_BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=%22the%20devil%27s%20chessboard%22%20%22john%20foster%20dulles%22&pg=PT20#v=onepage&q=%22a%20group%20of%20Wall%20Street%20plotters%22&f=false\">two small scale efforts</a> by Wall Street and big business to overthrow Roosevelt via military coup. Meanwhile, John Foster Dulles, a powerful corporate lawyer who later became secretary of state during the Eisenhower administration, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MeE_BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=%22the%20devil%27s%20chessboard%22%20%22john%20foster%20dulles%22&pg=PT10#v=onepage&q=%22the%20dulles%20brothers%20were%20not%20intimidated%20by%20mere%20presidents%22&f=false\">told his clients</a> facing new government restrictions: “Do not comply. Resist the law with all your might, and soon everything will be all right.”</p>\n<p>Dulles was wrong. From the viewpoint of conservatives, things did not get “all right” anytime soon. The New Deal was such a stunning political success that, starting with Roosevelt’s election in 1932, Democrats held the majority in the House of Representatives for 58 of the next 62 years until 1994. Democrats controlled the more-aristocratic Senate almost as firmly during the same period, for 52 years, and even managed to gain the presidency for a majority of that time. They provided an imperfect but real check on the right’s dream of rolling back the 20<span>th</span> century and returning the U.S. to the late 1800s.</p>\n<p>But Dulles and company handed their commitment to massive resistance down to their ideological descendants. And soon enough it erupted spectacularly during the presidency of Richard Nixon.</p>\n<p>There was an enormous amount of liberal self-congratulation after the Watergate investigation and Nixon’s resignation. The system worked! But that was true only in the sense that the system worked when Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion. And even that comparison isn’t quite accurate: Americans, at least, were aware of Capone’s bigger crimes.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Nixon’s most monstrous misconduct remains largely unknown, even today. It’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/politics/nixon-tried-to-spoil-johnsons-vietnam-peace-talks-in-68-notes-show.html\">now proven</a> that during the 1968 campaign he directly ordered his underlings to collude with a foreign power – South Vietnam – to prevent a peace deal that could have ended the Vietnam War. His motive was the most craven imaginable: He was worried that peace might help his opponent, Hubert Humphrey. Instead, Nixon won the presidency and in 1973 signed a treaty on essentially the same terms available five years earlier. Tens of thousands of Americans, as well as hundreds of thousands of people across Indochina, died thanks to what can without hyperbole be called treason by Nixon.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/richard-nixon-cambodia-1513782648.jpg\"><img alt=\"(Original Caption) 4/30/1970-Washington, DC-In a TV speech to the nation from the White House, President Nixon announced that several thousand American ground troops have entered Cambodia to wipe out Communist headquarters for all military operations against South Vietnam.

This was a blatant violation of the U.N. Charter and hence of the U.S. Constitution, yet the House Judiciary Committee rejected <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/1025/articlesNixon.pdf\">an article of impeachment</a> condemning it. This left the Nixon administration’s preposterous legal justification available for the Obama administration to cite <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/what-the-us-bombing-of-cambodia-tells-us-about-obamas-drone-campaign/273142/\">over 40 years later</a> as vindication for drone strikes in countries with which the U.S. is not at war.</p>\n<p>Instead Nixon was nailed for quite real fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. But the committee’s Bill of Particulars, which <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/1025/articlesNixon.pdf\">describes</a> Nixon soliciting campaign contributions from McDonald’s in return for letting them raise the price of a quarter pounder cheeseburger, does make it all seem, in the scheme of things, like small potatoes.</p>\n<p>While the Watergate investigation has been portrayed as a proud moment of bipartisan commitment to America’s glorious ideals, this is nearly the opposite of the truth. Nixon would unquestionably have evaded punishment if Republicans rather than Democrats had controlled Congress.</p>\n<p>Even with Democrats in charge, the first congressional attempt to look into it, led by populist Rep. Wright Patman, was effectively killed by Gerald Ford, who at the time was the House Republican leader. (While Ford <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slow_burn/2017/12/episode_two_of_slate_s_podcast_about_watergate.html\">claimed</a> he was only doing this because of a belief in good governance, he <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=oME9DQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=Blind%20Ambition%3A%20The%20White%20House%20Years&pg=PT103#v=onepage&q=%22i%27m%20getting%20into%20this%20thing%22&f=false\">almost certainly</a> was acting on Nixon’s orders.)</p>\n<p>Then there’s Howard Baker, the top Republican on the Senate Watergate Committee. Baker has long been celebrated for asking, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” But Baker was actually asking that in an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2014/0626/Howard-Baker-the-real-story-of-his-famous-Watergate-question\">protect Nixon</a>, and secretly met with Nixon to provide him with intelligence about the committee’s activities. The glowing reviews for Fred Thompson, then the committee’s minority counsel and later a GOP senator from Tennessee, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3447219&page=1\">are also a myth</a>.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Republicans engaged in their now-familiar cut-and-paste attacks on the press. Nixon’s press secretary <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slow_burn/2017/12/episode_three_of_slate_s_watergate_podcast_slow_burn.html\">declared</a> in 1972 that “I use the term shoddy journalism, shabby journalism, and I’ve used the term character assassination. … This is a political effort by the Washington Post, well-conceived and coordinated, to discredit this administration.” The purported coordination, of course, was supposedly with George McGovern, Nixon’s opponent that year.</p>\n<p>In the end, <a href=\"http://watergate.info/impeachment/analysis-judiciary-committee-impeachment-votes\">only a third</a> of the 17 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee voted for the three successful articles of impeachment. And even they largely did not do so out of any kind of high-mindedness. Rather, by 1974 the economy had collapsed — characters in the movie “Network,” made during this period, repeatedly refer to “the depression” — taking Nixon’s popularity with it.</p>\n<p>So with a slightly different roll of history’s dice, Nixon might have skated. But he didn’t. At that point Republicans could have taken one of two lessons from the experience: either “Don’t commit impeachable offenses” or “Build walls to protect yourself when you commit impeachable offenses … and get revenge.” They went with door number two.</p>\n<p><u>It was during</u> the Nixon administration that Roger Ailes <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5814150/roger-ailes-secret-nixon-era-blueprint-for-fox-news\">developed</a> what he called “A Plan for Putting the GOP on TV News.” Eventually this would become Fox News, and give Ailes the power to generate a self-contained alternate reality for the Republican grassroots. The right’s other area of vulnerability was the courts, which had repeatedly ruled against Nixon. The so-called “<a href=\"http://reclaimdemocracy.org/powell_memo_lewis/\">Powell memo</a>,” which laid down the blueprint for the right’s counteroffensive of the last 40 years, emphasized that “the judiciary may be the most important instrument for social, economic and political change.” Ever since, the right has made an enormous investment in shaping the Supreme Court as well as lower courts, in particular the critical U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Democratic Party was undergoing a peculiar cultural shift that’s led them to celebrate losing honorably for the good of the country. This was in fact the exact language of Clark Clifford, one of the “wise men” surrounding Lyndon Johnson when his administration discovered Nixon’s appalling Vietnam chicanery just before the 1968 election. Clifford <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v07/d192\">successfully argued to Johnson</a> that “some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I’m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story … It could cast [Nixon’s] whole administration under such doubts that I would think it would be inimical to our country’s interests.” Top Democrats, including Johnson, Clifford, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and National Security Adviser Walt Rostow generously took Nixon’s secret with them to their graves.</p>\n<p>The same perspective caused Democrats to meekly accept a new status quo when it came to special counsels. Incredibly enough, there hasn’t been a significant investigation <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/02/jared-kushner-still-has-a-job-because-washington-only-fears-republicans/\">headed by a special counsel who’s a Democrat</a> since Nixon fired Archibald Cox in 1973. Democrats have internalized a heads-you-win-tails-I-lose belief that an investigation of a Republican administration can’t be handled by a Democrat, whereas one investigating a Democratic administration must be conducted by a Republican. The same goes for the head of the FBI: Every single one in the bureau’s history, including three appointed by Democratic presidents, has been a Republican.</p>\n<p>For their part, the elite print and broadcast media accepted the right’s critique that they were – as huge profit-driven corporations naturally tend to be – horribly liberal. This made them uncomfortable with their own power, and they decided not to use it against Republicans. Ben Bradlee, editor of the Washington Post during Watergate, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=kJg-DwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=ben%20bradlee%20good%20life&pg=PA402#v=onepage&q=%22at%20least%20I%20began%20to%20feel%22&f=false\">explained in his autobiography</a> that he “began to feel subconsciously that what the world did <em>not</em> need right away was another investigation that might again threaten the foundations of democracy. What the newspaper did <em>not</em> need right away was another fight to the finish with another president — especially a Republican president. [emphasis in original]”</p>\n<p>This dynamic — an aggressive GOP versus a Democratic Party and media both terrified of getting two for flinching – has only accelerated since.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/iran-contra-investigation-1513788535.jpg\"><img alt=\"UNITED STATES - JULY 08:  Lt.

Col. Oliver North is sworn in at the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings.</p>\n<p>Photo: NY Daily News Archive/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>During the Iran-Contra affair of the mid-1980s, Ronald Reagan almost certainly committed impeachable offenses. Specifically, he had, in violation of the Arms Control Act, approved the sale of weapons to Iran in 1985. After the story broke, the independent counsel named to investigate it was Lawrence Walsh, a stalwart Republican who’d previously been appointed to various high-level positions during the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations.</p>\n<p>It didn’t matter. As it became clear that Reagan was vulnerable, and his underlings had engaged in a massive cover up to protect him, Walsh was <a href=\"https://consortiumnews.com/2014/03/21/firewall-inside-the-iran-contra-cover-up/\">ferociously attacked</a> by his own party. The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times denounced him, as did members of the mainstream media anxious to demonstrate that they’d turned over a new, less-liberal leaf.</p>\n<p>By the end of 1992, Walsh had discovered that Reagan’s successor, George H.W. Bush, had likely committed his own impeachable crimes while concealing his role in the scandal. But Bush, on his way out the door after losing to Bill Clinton, pardoned six convicted or indicted Iran-Contra defendants. “George Bush’s misuse of the pardon power,” Walsh later wrote, “made the cover up complete.”</p>\n<p>But if Republicans were certain that Republican presidents were innocent, they knew that Clinton, as a Democrat, was inherently guilty. All they needed to do was figure out exactly why.</p>\n<p>The New York Times got the ball rolling with its preposterous coverage of the Whitewater scandal – which did indeed involve minor crimes, but none committed by Bill or Hillary Clinton. Republicans seized upon Whitewater to demand an independent counsel.</p>\n<p>Clinton’s attorney general, Janet Reno, chose Robert Fiske, a Republican who’d been appointed U.S. District Attorney by Gerald Ford. Unfortunately, Fiske failed to produce the right results: The Clintons had not improperly tried to influence bank regulators in Arkansas, nor had they murdered White House counsel Vince Foster. The Wall Street Journal decried “The Fiske Cover Up.”</p>\n<p>There was only one solution: another, more disciplined Republican independent counsel. Two GOP-appointed judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia replaced Fiske with Kenneth Starr. Starr produced results after a mere four years, having somehow expanded the Whitewater investigation to cover Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton’s impeachment was overseen by Newt Gingrich and Dennis Hastert, an enthusiastic adulterer and child molester, respectively. (The Whitewater probe was eventually wrapped up in 2003, nine years after it started, by a third Republican counsel, Robert Ray.)</p>\n<p>Next up was the 2000 election. It’s been totally forgotten now, but in the week before the vote, the George W. Bush campaign became worried Bush might win the popular vote while losing the electoral college. They therefore <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/10/21/it-isnt-just-donald-trump-the-bush-campaign-plotted-to-reject-election-results-in-2000/\">laid plans to grab the presidency</a> with national demonstrations demanding that Al Gore bow to the clearly expressed will of the people.</p>\n<p>Gore was even preemptively condemned for his selfishness. Ray LaHood, a Republican member of the House from Illinois, declared that it “would be an outrage” if Gore assumed office under such circumstances. Chris Matthews <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/accuracy-vs-speed/\">also felt strongly, saying</a> that “knowing him as we do, [Gore] may have no problem taking the presidential oath after losing the popular vote to George W. Bush.”</p>\n<p>Of course, exactly the opposite happened. Bush officially won Florida and the electoral college when the Supreme Court halted the Florida recount in a 5-4 decision. The five members of the majority were all chosen by Republican presidents, while two of the dissenters were GOP appointees and two had been picked by Clinton. Gore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/14/uselections2000.usa14\">immediately and obediently conceded</a>.</p>\n<p>A full examination published in November 2001 found that under every possible standard <a href=\"https://www.consortiumnews.com/2001/111201a.html\">Gore would have won Florida</a> if all the votes had been counted. The Washington Post published a story about this on page A10.</p>\n<p>By then Matthews and LaHood had both long lost interest in this subject. Matthews, who said that he’d voted for Bush, became a star on the liberal MSNBC. Nine years afterward in 2009, President Obama named LaHood secretary of transportation.</p>\n<p>Within a few years, Bush was embroiled in the Valerie Plame affair. Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed by James Comey, then-deputy attorney general, to investigate. While Comey was a Republican, Fitzgerald, in a scandalous anomaly, was not. He wasn’t a Democrat, of course; he was just an independent.</p>\n<p>He was also loudly slurred as unconscionably biased.</p>\n<p>Bill Kristol, a top neoconservative, pronounced that “the whole prosecution is absurd” because Fitzpatrick “is now out to discredit the Bush administration.” William Safire called him “a runaway Chicago prosecutor,” while CNN’s Lou Dobbs said Fitzgerald was engaging in “an onerous, disgusting abuse of government power.” Four months after Bush administration official Scooter Libby was convicted of multiple counts of perjury and obstruction of justice, Bush commuted his sentence.</p>\n<p><u>That brings us</u> to today and the Mueller investigation, with the GOP exploring new frontiers of rhetoric. It goes without saying that Mueller, a Republican appointed by a Republican deputy attorney general who in turn was appointed by a Republican president, is running an investigation that’s incredibly unfair to Republicans. Fox’s Jesse Watters has been <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-jesse-watters-suggests-we-may-have-anti-trump-coup-on-our-hands-in-america/\">making the case</a> that it is in fact “a coup” aiming to destroy Trump “for partisan political purposes and to disenfranchise millions of American voters.” For her part, Fox’s Jeanine Pirro <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-pirro-stands-by-her-call-for-an-fbi-cleansing-people-need-to-be-led-out-in-cuffs/\">believes</a> that “the only thing that remains is whether we have the fortitude to not just fire these people immediately, but to take them out in cuffs.” Trump himself has referred to the FBI, one of the most notoriously conservative government agencies, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/politics/trump-fbi.html\">constituting</a> a “rigged system” — rigged against him – whose “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937305615218696193\">reputation is in Tatters</a>.”</p>\n<p>So, it’s almost impossible to imagine Trump being forced to pay any price by fellow Republicans. The GOP has spent 43 years constructing an enormous network of well-funded, committed defenders in Congress, the courts and the media. This in turn has allowed them to live in a mental universe in which they cannot do wrong, and therefore any attempts to impose restrictions on them are morally outrageous. The system is now working at full throttle. As Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan and H.W. Bush staffer, and current GOP heretic, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/05/18/roger-ailes-dead-but-conservative-media-bubble-lives-on-bruce-bartlett-column/101806738/#pq=2dVNEq\">forlornly says</a>, if Watergate happened today, “Nixon would have finished his term.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: Marine Lt.

        "content": "<p><u>Credit unions fared</u> well in the GOP tax bill passed through Congress on Wednesday, despite lobbying efforts by big banks to tilt the playing field against them. But they didn’t get everything they wanted.</p>\n<p>A provision that dealt with executive compensation would unfairly penalize credit unions, industry leaders complained after the bill first moved through the Senate in early December. Not to worry, urged lobbyists with the Credit Union National Association, there will be another chance to make themselves whole.</p>\n<p>“We expect a tax technical corrections bill to be considered in Congress in 2018, and CUNA will actively advocate for not-for-profit parity with for-profit businesses regarding employee contract parity and the ‘grandfathering’ of existing contracts,” CUNA promised the credit unions it represents.</p>\n<p>Republican leaders in Congress, after determining to go for $6 trillion in tax cuts, almost exclusively for the wealthy and major corporations, needed a way to balance some of those cuts out in order to squeeze it through the budget process known as reconciliation, which requires only a simple-majority vote in the Senate. The search through the nation’s couch cushions resulted in countless parties equally aggrieved as the credit unions. They now want their coins back. The lobbying battle in Washington, and the looting that comes with it, is just getting started.</p>\n<p>“Next big fight is ‘technical corrections,'” Democratic lobbyist Heather Podesta, who runs the firm Invariant, told The Intercept. “Game on.”</p>\n<p>That effort will compete with, and in some ways complement, a parallel effort to shape how the hastily written law translates into actual IRS regulations.</p>\n<p>The breakneck process through which the bill passed has set the stage for special interests to take another crack at shaping tax policy. Lobbyists thrive on a poorly constructed statute, as it leaves wide room for interpretation when it comes to writing the regulation, and also opens the door for a “technical correction” that, in reality, is brand-new policy masquerading as a noncontroversial tweak.</p>\n<p>Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist and a partner at CGCN Group, said that Washington’s influence industry will now move to its next phase.</p>\n<p>“A law firm will draft a proposed reg that benefits their client(s). A public affairs campaign will be structured around getting the reg drafted correctly, with opeds and media coverage. And then someone will hire us to hand the proposed reg and the favorable press clips to the lawmakers and agencies,” he told The Intercept over email. “We should all be registered as lobbyists, including the media outlets who accept our advertising. Unfortunately, the lobbyists are the only ones to disclose their role in this process.”</p>\n<p>Most major legislative reforms require technical corrections, until recently done on a bipartisan basis to fix uncontroversial errors slipped into the text. After the 1986 tax reform, <a href=\"https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/News/7cf46943-3d1d-42b2-9fe0-fcc5bb8bf725/Presentation/NewsAttachment/59cda6f2-2cdc-4e8a-bf0c-60921fd7b44d/RushToPassTaxReformLikelyToLeaveYearsofFixes.pdf\">several</a> technical corrections were passed to resolve unintentional issues created by the law.</p>\n<p>But that comity was broken in the wake of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which included its share of drafting errors. Republicans, however, refused to negotiate fixes and threatened a filibuster in the Senate. And so the law limped along as originally written.</p>\n<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, drafted largely in secret and passed rapidly over the course of only two months, is expected to create a tidal wave of unforeseen tax issues. Tax experts have <a href=\"https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/News/7cf46943-3d1d-42b2-9fe0-fcc5bb8bf725/Presentation/NewsAttachment/59cda6f2-2cdc-4e8a-bf0c-60921fd7b44d/RushToPassTaxReformLikelyToLeaveYearsofFixes.pdf\">expressed</a> concern that some substantial changes will require a 60-vote majority in the Senate, a legislative scenario that would set up a round of negotiations with Democratic lawmakers. The speed with which the bill was written already caused Republicans headaches, as the Senate parliamentarian ruled that two provisions, and even the bill’s short title, were in violations of the rules of reconciliation, requiring an embarrassed House to hold an extra vote after it had thought it was finished.</p>\n<p>But for tax lobbyists, law firms, public affairs consultants, and <a href=\"https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/the-accountants-full-employment-act\">accountants</a>, the next round means full employment.</p>\n<p>Republicans have made no secret of their plan to try to fix their bill after it becomes law. Only days before the House of Representatives passed the final conference report of the tax bill, one of the primary architects warned reporters — and the lobbyists reading them — to expect another round of changes. “I can’t imagine any major undertaking like this that doesn’t require technical corrections in the future,” Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-bill-technical-corrections_us_5a380422e4b01d429ccb49c8\">told</a> reporters on Friday.</p>\n<p>K Street, no doubt, will be ready to assist.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, center, is joined by House Republican leaders while talking to reporters following passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the Will Rogers Corridor at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 19, 2017 in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/20/gop-tax-bill-lobbyist/\">“Game On”: K Street Salivating Over Next Step in Tax Fight</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Weeks before the</u> Republican-led Congress moved toward final passage of its corporate tax cut bill, major companies had <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/18/tax-bill-corporate-rate-stock-buyback/\">already begun a surge</a> of stock buybacks — confirming critics’ fears that the windfall of lower rates will be used for self-enrichment rather than job growth.</p>\n<p>Home Depot led the buyback splurge, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/18/tax-bill-corporate-rate-stock-buyback/\">pocketing $15 billion</a>. On an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4130797-home-depots-hd-ceo-craig-menear-hosts-2017-investor-analyst-day-conference-transcript?part=single\">earnings call</a> held earlier this month, the company’s CFO Carol Tomé <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4130797-home-depots-hd-ceo-craig-menear-hosts-2017-investor-analyst-day-conference-transcript?part=single\">quietly admitted</a> the strategy, when asked about the impact of tax reform on the firm:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It really all depends on if it happens and when it happens and how we would spend it. Cash is fungible. Right now, we’re thinking it might not happen until 2019, so obviously we are using internally generated cash in 2018 to invest in the business and return capital to our shareholders.<strong> If it were to happen in 2019, we might use the tax — cash tax savings to invest in the business and then use — generated cash to back buy [sic] shares, it’s all fungible.</strong> The point is, we’re going to generate a lot, we may get some from tax reform and we will use it. We will invest back in the business, and we will return it our [sic] shareholders.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By “return it to our shareholders,” she is referring to a buyback, which drives up the price of a stock and can come with dividends as well. Typically, executives hold much of their wealth in company stock, and their compensation is tied to the performance of the shares.</p>\n<p>Other corporations are expected to use the windfall to increase mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) or invest in automation. “Industry executives have been eagerly anticipating tax reform in earnings calls, interviews and casual conversation all year. Multiple CEOs have projected major M&amp;A activity will follow if any kind of corporate rate reduction is finalized, further accelerating the rapid pace of consolidation in the industry,” <a href=\"https://www.wastedive.com/news/how-the-gop-tax-bill-could-affect-the-waste-industry/513310/\">wrote one industry publication</a> about how waste companies are anticipating tax reform.</p>\n<p>But the House Republicans who wrote and passed the tax bill on Tuesday have ignored these warnings. In interviews with The Intercept, members suggested that stock buybacks, as well as M&amp;A, will either be rare or not that harmful to the economy.</p>\n<p>Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., didn’t believe in the buyback threat because some executives publicly pledged to increase jobs. “Most recently … the Delta CEO, and I don’t recall his name, he acknowledged that when the economy grows, it helps them and he doesn’t intend to buyback stock, he intends on making a better product,” she said. When we followed up on whether she anticipates any merger or stock buyback wave, she replied, “I don’t anticipate that happening.”</p>\n<p>Other members conceded that buybacks and M&amp;As may happen, but essentially shrugged off the ramifications.</p>\n<p>Freshman Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., was one of those. “I don’t think we should count the chickens before the Senate votes. And I suspect that different companies will use this tax cut in different ways. The economy is always a different mosaic of different options and opportunities for people,” he said. “Not every instance of a buyback of stock is bad. Sometimes that can help spur more growth. We’ll see.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va.,  — who as you may recall unseated Eric Cantor with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/us/politics/david-brat-waged-solo-fight-against-eric-cantor.html\">populist campaign</a> railing against the influence of corporate lobbyists — refused to even consider the possibility that corporations won’t use the windfall for job creation.</p>\n<p>“That’s just a talking point,” he said of concerns about stock buybacks and consolidation. “Billions of cash have been on the side. So rationally, right, what would an economist tell you? If you’ve got billions of dollars on the sideline doing nothing, is that rational? No, it tells you they can’t find any investment that’s worthwhile.”</p>\n<p>He insisted that the wave of mergers and stock buybacks was a feature of the previous president. “Yeah, under the Obama economy that’s what they did. That’s true. Watch what happens now,” he said.</p>\n<p>When we reminded him that <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/27/bush-already-tried-trumps-proposed-corporate-tax-holiday-and-it-was-a-total-failure/\">corporations used</a> a tax repatriation holiday enacted under George W. Bush to do exactly that, he was unmoved. “OK, that’s good but it doesn’t take down what I just said,” he retorted.</p>\n<p>Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., admitted that they don’t really know what corporations will do with the money. “Well, from the standpoint of tax policy, you can’t dictate how a corporation is going to rebalance their balance sheet as a consequence of tax change. So what I’d say is it’s the intended and hoped for effect of the bill that they’ll invest … but it’s not the guarantee of the bill,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rep. Mark Meadows, R-S.C., Freedom Caucus chair, admitted that a stock buyback wave is possible.</p>\n<p>“There could be. Anything could happen tomorrow, right now we’re at record-breaking pace in the stock market,” he boomed.</p>\n<p>Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., who serves on the Financial Services Committee, said that he is more or less taking corporate executives at their word, noting that they had promised Congress that they will reduce corporate inversions as a result of the bill.</p>\n<p>“The corporate executives that we have talked to who are at risk of inverting and moving jobs and investment overseas, they have told us that this is indispensable legislation to preventing that from going forward,” he said. “The mergers and acquisitions are happening <em>now</em> because of the broken tax code that we have.” An inversion occurs when a company takes over a smaller one offshore merely for the tax advantages.</p>\n<p>He did concede that we will see M&amp;A activity, but that it will be what he perceives to be the good kind. “Of course there’s going to be mergers and acquisitions whenever you have a growing economy, but they’re going to be healthy. They’re not going to be unhealthy mergers and acquisitions that are associated with a non-competitive corporate tax system,” he said.</p>\n<p>Other House Republicans just didn’t have an answer about the possibility of stock buysbacks and mergers.</p>\n<p>“Talk to a Ways and Means [Committee member], I don’t know anything about [that],” Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., responded when asked.</p>\n<p>Upton <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fred-upton-encourages-senate-bid-speculation/article/2634202\">is contemplating </a>a bid for Senate.</p>\n<p>Top photo: People walk by the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 19, 2017 in New York.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/19/tax-bill-corporate-cut-stock-buyback-republican/\">Corporations Say Publicly They’ll Pocket the Tax Cut, But Republicans Aren’t Listening</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

Under former President Barack Obama, the agency had been in the process of restricting the use of the three commonly available chemicals, but the Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain\">latest update</a> on its effort to roll back regulation puts the proposed Obama rules on the back burner.</p>\n<p>The three chemicals  — <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/fact-sheet-trichloroethylene-tce\">TCE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201710&RIN=2070-AK07\">NMP</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201710&RIN=2070-AK07\">methylene chloride</a> — are used to strip furniture, remove grease, and dry clean clothes. All three are clearly dangerous: The EPA has deemed TCE a carcinogen “by all routes of exposure,” NMP is a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18468972\">developmental toxin</a>, and methylene chloride has killed at least <a href=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/09/21/17991/common-solvent-keeps-killing-workers-consumers\">56 people</a> since 1980, many of whom were stripping <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6107a2.htm\">bathtubs</a>.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration has dimmed the possibility of quick action on these — and perhaps all — dangerous chemicals. The new <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain\">regulatory plan</a>, which the White House released last week, showed that the chemicals were moved from the proposed rule category to “long term action.” In all, 469 Obama-era regulations <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2017/12/18/trumps-new-deregulatory-agenda/#3243a8212f60\">were withdrawn</a> and 860 put on hold.</p>\n<p>Although there was no mandatory date for finalizing the Obama rules, the bans were widely expected to take effect in 2018. An official move to “long-term” action means the process will be slowed, perhaps indefinitely.</p>\n<p>The EPA did not respond to specific questions for this article but provided a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-annual-regulatory-plan\">link</a> to information on the regulatory plan, which included this quote from EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt: “EPA’s plan balances its statutory requirements to issue regulations and its commitment to providing regulatory certainty through improvements to existing regulations that were flawed, outdated, ineffective, or unnecessarily burdensome.”</p>\n<p>The EPA had proposed a ban on certain uses of the three chemicals on January 19, one day before Donald Trump’s inauguration. In response, the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance launched a <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2016-0163-0150\">campaign</a> to delay the impending regulation on TCE. HSIA also asked for an extension of the comment period on methylene chloride and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333156-Squire-Patton-Boggs-for-HSIA-May-19-2017.html\">argued</a> that the chemical doesn’t cause cancer. In December, HSIA’s attorney <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/viewEO12866Meeting?viewRule=false&rin=2070-AK07&meetingId=2159&acronym=2070-EPA/OCSPP\">met</a> with the EPA and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to discuss NMP and methylene chloride. At the meeting, attorney <a href=\"https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/en/professionals/n/norman-w-caffey\">W. Caffey Norman</a> of Squire Patton Boggs <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333013-OMB-DCM-Meeting-HSIA.html\">contested</a> the EPA’s science on the chemical and argued that the proposed rule should not go forward.</p>\n<p>Contacted by The Intercept, Faye Graul, executive director of HSIA, took issue with the EPA’s evaluation of TCE and methylene chloride, which had been carried out under an older version of the Toxic Substances Control Act. She said she believes the chemicals should be considered under the updated version of that law, which was signed by Obama in June. Re-evaluating the substances under the new law would add years to the process.</p>\n<p>When asked if the organization had gotten what it wanted with the proposed delay on action on these chemicals, Graul replied, “That is exactly what we asked for, yes.”</p>\n<p>Yet chemical safety advocates argue that any delay leaves the public at risk. “We have people literally dying from the continued access to products at your local hardware store that can kill you and this agency still refuses to act,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. “This EPA seems to have put a premium on meeting its deadlines. But when it comes to chemical specific action, they’re all about delay.”</p>\n<p>“These are bellwether proposals,” said Bob Sussman, general counsel for the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coalition and a former attorney for EPA. “This is the first time EPA is proposing significant regulation. It is a test of whether the expectations for the new law will be met. If EPA can’t summon the willpower to finalize these very compelling proposed rules, it’s not going to be able to regulate anything.”</p>\n<p>Top photo: In this aerial photograph about 10 miles upriver from New Orleans, the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex, an oil refinery, is seen in St. Charles Parish, La., along the Mississippi River on Jan. 10, 2016.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/19/trump-administration-rolls-back-epa-plan-to-restrict-dangerous-household-chemicals/\">Trump Administration Rolls Back EPA Plan to Restrict Dangerous Household Chemicals</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>“The FBI has</u> become America’s secret police.”</p>\n<p>Gregg Jarrett was just getting started. It was December 6, and the Fox News legal analyst <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/12/06/gregg-jarrett-mueller-probe-donald-trump-illegitimate-and-corrupt\">was a guest on Sean Hannity’s show.</a> They were kicking off what would become the newest right-wing talking points about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>“Secret surveillance, wiretapping, intimidation, harassment, and threats,” Jarrett continued. “It’s like the old KGB that comes for you in the dark of the night, banging through your door.”</p>\n<p>“By the way, this not a game,” Hannity interjected. “This is not hyperbole you’re using here.”</p>\n<p>“No. Ask Paul Manafort,” Jarrett replied, referring to the FBI’s search of the former Trump campaign manager’s home. “They came for him and broke through his front door.”</p>\n<p>“And if it can happen to him, Gregg,” Hannity offered.</p>\n<p>“It can happen to all of us,” Jarrett continued. “Absolutely.”</p>\n<p>This message — that the FBI is overly aggressive and politically motivated — is cropping up again and again on Fox News, bellowed by right-wing pundits and elected officials like Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. A Fox commentator, Todd Starnes, even <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/17/todd-starnes-was-fbi-weaponized-to-take-down-trump-presidency.html\">asked</a> point-blank, “Was the FBI weaponized to take down the Trump presidency?” A chyron on the network was yet more succinct: “A coup in America?”</p>\n<p>All of this carries forward the rhetoric of a president who has tweeted insults at the FBI since his election. On December 3, for example, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937305615218696193\">tweeted</a> that the FBI’s “reputation is in Tatters — worst in History!” In his latest burst in the past week, Trump <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/17/todd-starnes-was-fbi-weaponized-to-take-down-trump-presidency.html\">told reporters</a> on the South Lawn of the White House, “It’s a shame what’s happened to the FBI.” The context is quite obvious: The president and his supporters are worried that Mueller, a former FBI director, will find reasons for impeachment, and they’re on the attack to undermine the credibility of the FBI and the special counsel.</p>\n<p>Right-wing media and politicians aren’t entirely wrong about the FBI. It <em>is</em> a secret police that bangs down people’s doors, follows Americans, intercepts digital communications, digs through trash, and harasses and threatens potential informants or targets of criminal investigations. In fact, civil rights activists and left-wing groups have been complaining about this for more than 50 years. And since the 9/11 attacks, Muslims in the United States have been subjected to an unprecedented level of intrusive surveillance. A common joke in mosques around the country: “Whenever I pray on Friday, I just assume the man next to me is an FBI informant.”</p>\n<p>While it’s entirely true that the FBI has few checks on its power, right-wing media did not rouse itself until allegations emerged that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian intelligence agents. What’s amusing about the right’s sudden anti-FBI hysteria is that little evidence suggests Mueller’s investigation has been anything but by the book.</p>\n<p>Let’s review some of the evidence of this so-called FBI coup.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/bob-robert-mueller-fbi-1513699786.jpg\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 21:  Special counsel Robert Mueller (C) leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee June 21, 2017 at the Capitol in Washington, DC.

FBI lawyer Lisa Page and counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok were having an affair, and the pair used their FBI mobile phones to text each other.</p>\n<p>The FBI’s newest critics have zeroed in on one text from Strzok that they argue suggests some sort of “deep state” plot against Trump. Seeming to refer to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Strzok wrote to Page: “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”</p>\n<p>In another text message, referring to Clinton, Strzok wrote: “Oh hot damn. HRC is throwing down saying Trump in bed with Russia.”</p>\n<p>There is nothing unusually partisan about Strzok’s text messages. The mood of the country at the time of these texts was one of worry about the prospect of Trump being elected. President Barack Obama had expressed publicly that he did not trust Trump with nuclear weapons — an unprecedented statement from a sitting president about a major party candidate — and Trump had compounded fears by advocating that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/06/should-more-countries-have-nuclear-weapons-donald-trump-thinks-so/?utm_term=.587aa4465e82\">South Korea and Saudi Arabia become nuclear states</a>. In the context of a nation concerned about electing a potentially incompetent and petulant president, the text messages between Strzok and Page do not appear to differ from the views of about half of the country’s electorate. Strzok’s texts even included a description of Democratic primary candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders as an “idiot like Trump.” There were many FBI agents who preferred Clinton to Trump. While some may have been partisan, others were concerned about Trump’s temperament and respect for the rule of law. Should every agent who voted for Clinton be run out of the bureau?</p>\n<p>In addition, we have no way of knowing at this point what Strzok knew about the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia and how that might have informed his concerns about a Trump presidency.</p>\n<h3>The No-Knock Search</h3>\n<p>When the FBI raided Manafort’s home in July, agents arrived before dawn and busted open the door without warning. In FBI parlance, this is a “no-knock search.” A judge must sign off on such a search, which is generally justified by FBI concerns about the safety of agents or the destruction of evidence. While critics have a strong argument that the FBI too frequently requests permission for no-knock searches, nothing in the Manafort case suggests the search was unjustified given the FBI’s general practices. The FBI has used no-knock searches in even minor cases, including <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/10/recordings-capture-brutal-fbi-tactics-to-recruit-potential-informant/\">one</a> that involved a search for counterfeit car parts.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/fbi-michael-flynn-1513699796.jpg\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 01:  Michael Flynn, former national security advisor to President Donald Trump, leaves following his plea hearing at the Prettyman Federal Courthouse December 1, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Flynn with one count of making a false statement to the FBI.</p>\n<p>Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p></div>\n<h3>The Intercepts</h3>\n<p>The FBI built its case against Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who has become a cooperating witness after pleading guilty to making false statements to the FBI, through intercepts of phone conversations between Flynn and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Flynn lied to FBI agents about the contents of these conversations.</p>\n<p>For counterintelligence purposes, U.S. officials monitor the communications of spies and foreign diplomats under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It would be surprising if Russia’s ambassador was not being monitored, which is what makes it all the more surprising that Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, would choose to have unencrypted phone calls with Kislyak. While the leaking to the media of Flynn’s calls with Kislyak was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/02/14/the-leakers-who-exposed-gen-flynns-lie-committed-serious-and-wholly-justified-felonies/\">a potential criminal act</a>, the calls were intercepted under legal authority and in line with how the FBI conducts counterintelligence investigations.</p>\n<p>The same appears to be true of former Trump adviser Carter Page, whose <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.d35bfae92399\">communications were monitored under FISA authority</a> after the FBI established probable cause that Page was acting as a Russian agent.</p>\n<p>While there’s plenty of room for <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/30/nsa-surveillance-fisa-section-702/\">FISA abuses</a>, the intercepts involving Flynn and Page appear to have followed standard FBI counterintelligence methods.</p>\n<h3>The Lies</h3>\n<p>Mueller’s investigation has so far resulted in two guilty pleas. Both Flynn and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI as part of deals in which they have become cooperating witnesses.</p>\n<p>Trump and his media supporters have pointed out that court records filed in these cases do not establish evidence of collusion and that these two men were convicted for their own lies. While this is true, the argument ignores how the FBI works. Making a false statement to the FBI is a felony offense punishable by up to five years in prison; most people are unaware of this. For that reason, the FBI uses the lying offense as a bludgeon to force cooperation, or as a substitute for more serious offenses.</p>\n<p>In Flynn’s case, Mueller and his team appeared to have significantly more serious charges they could have levied against the former national security adviser. Indicting him for false statements was a way of letting Flynn off easy — not bringing more serious charges — in exchange for his cooperation.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Papadopoulos would likely not be a criminal today had he simply not spoken to the FBI. Unlike Flynn, he does not appear to have committed any crime other than attempting to deceive the bureau. But because he had lied, the FBI was able to use the felony charge as leverage to force Papadopoulos to cooperate.</p>\n<p>Papadopoulos might have known to shut up had he paid any attention to how the FBI has investigated other groups. Since the 9/11 attacks, for example, <a href=\"https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/?charge=making%20false%20statements\">139 terrorism cases have involved charges of making false statements</a>. Muslim civil rights groups routinely advise people never to speak with FBI agents.</p>\n<h3>The Emails</h3>\n<p>A lawyer for Trump criticized Mueller for obtaining <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-unlawfully-obtained-emails-trump-transition-team-says/2017/12/16/6162f350-e2cc-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html?utm_term=.3a52093a53bf\">transition team emails</a> that had been stored on servers administered by the General Services Administration. If Mueller requested the emails from the GSA, under one of the many legal authorities he possesses as special counsel, and GSA employees in turn provided those emails, this would appear to be a fairly benign and legal way for the FBI to obtain information.</p>\n<p>Under FBI rules, Mueller and his team have much more invasive ways to obtain information. Let’s say Mueller’s investigators think a former Trump adviser would make a good informant. FBI agents can use a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-gives-itself-lots-of-rope-to-pull-in-informants/\">Type 5 assessment</a> to surveil the former adviser and even root through the former adviser’s trash for 72 hours in order to find information they can use to leverage cooperation. Imagine the outcry if this had indeed been done. And understand that the FBI has done this many, many times in a variety of other investigations over the years — without a hint of protest from the right wing.</p>\n<p>If the FBI’s tactics in the Mueller investigation seem overly aggressive or partisan, you just haven’t been paying attention to the FBI. America’s secret police has the legal authority to be much more intrusive.</p>\n<p>Top photo: Crime scene tape casts yellow on FBI agents after a shooting on Nov. 14, 2017, in Rancho Tehama, Calif.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/19/fbi-trump-russia-investigation-mueller/\">The FBI Routinely Abuses Its Powers but the Trump Investigation Has Been By the Book</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><u>Democrats are set</u> to vote this week on who will replace Rep. John Conyers Jr., the powerful top-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee who resigned earlier this month due to accusations of sexual misconduct from former aides.</p>\n<p>The decision will shape the trajectory of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats retake control of the House and, in 2020, the White House. The contest pits the next two senior-most Democrats on the committee against each other: New York City Rep. Jerry Nadler and Silicon Valley Rep. Zoe Lofgren. Both are among the most progressive members of Congress, with strong records on civil liberties. Nadler is considered a friend of the creative community, while Lofgren is close to big tech firms.</p>\n<p>The Democrats’ steering committee will vote Tuesday and make a recommendation to the entire Democratic caucus, which will vote the following day.</p>\n<p>The chair of the committee, should Democrats take control, would have considerable influence to set the agenda on <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/28/john-conyers-google-zoe-lofgren-house-judiciary-committee/\">antitrust policy</a>, law enforcement oversight, immigration reform, gun control, and surveillance. And while Donald Trump is still president, the chair would face pressure from activists and other Democrats to begin impeachment proceedings.</p>\n<p>Elected in 1992, Nadler is two years Lofgren’s senior on the committee and assumed the role of acting ranking member when Conyers stepped aside as chair. Nadler has already secured the endorsement of NARAL, a prominent pro-choice advocacy group, which wrote a letter to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi last week calling him a “true leader in protecting women’s constitutional right to reproductive freedom.”</p>\n<p>Nadler was also a leading figure in pushing back on warrantless wiretapping after 9/11. Despite the fact that he represented the district where the World Trade Center fell, Nadler voted against the Patriot Act and has repeatedly tried to reform its surveillance authorities. Lofgren is a more recent convert to the cause and voted for the Patriot Act, but has since said she <a href=\"https://www.theodysseyonline.com/odyssey-interview-congresswoman-zoe-lofgren\">regrets it.</a></p>\n<p>Nadler’s office did not respond to request for comment, and Lofgren’s office declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Since Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing the scope of the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, Lofgren has overtaken Nadler as the House Democrats leading privacy advocate. Since 2013, she has sponsored multiple measures defunding “backdoor searches” — which allow domestic law enforcement agencies to sift through certain kinds of NSA data looking for evidence of a crime.</p>\n<p>Lofgren is also an immigration expert, having taught immigration law before holding elected office. And in 2012, Lofgren led the fight that defeated the Stop Online Piracy Act, which would have placed harsh copyright restrictions on sites like YouTube and Facebook. Nadler was supportive of SOPA.</p>\n<p>Lofgren’s close ties to tech companies, meanwhile, have put her on the wrong side of the anti-monopoly politics that have emerged in progressive circles in recent years. During the Obama administration, Lofgren publicly urged antitrust authorities not to go after Google and condemned European authorities when they actually did. But Lofgren has opposed the tech companies in other ways, criticizing them for their <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/07/03/tech-workforce-diversity-recognizing-problem-is-the-first-step-to-solving-it/\">lack of diversity</a> and advocating reforms for the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act – a law that harshly and redundantly criminalizes hacking, which tech companies generally want to keep in place. And earlier this month, Lofgren raised concerns about competition among <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/dem-seeking-top-spot-on-key-panel-wants-examination-of-data-and-antitrust-2514141871.html\">data companies</a> in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: December 20, 2017, 11:04 a.m.</strong><br>\nRep. Jerry Nadler won the race to become the House Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat in a 118-72 vote Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Top photo: From left, Reps.

        "content": "<p><u>In her first</u> comments to the press, former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said she will cooperate fully with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into “collusion with the Russians” during the 2016 campaign, and is currently searching for relevant documents. Stein denies holding any substantive communications with the Russian government or RT, its state-owned media property.</p>\n<p>Stein says her involvement in the inquiry, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/the-senates-russia-investigation-is-now-looking-into-jill\">first reported by BuzzFeed News</a>, came as a surprise when her campaign was first contacted last month. After a subsequent dialogue between attorneys representing Stein and lawyers from the Senate Intelligence Committee, the former candidate received a formal request for cooperation. Although she says the possibility of testifying before Congress has not yet been broached, Stein says she would be “happy to do so” if asked.</p>\n<p>Still, Stein clearly resents the Senate’s attention vis-à-vis  electoral interference and foreign meddling: “This smacks of the dangerous underbelly of these investigations. The extent to which they exercise overreach, politicizing, and sensationalism is a danger to democracy, especially in the current climate of all-out war on our First Amendment rights. This is not a time to be attacking the rights of political speech and political association.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Stein’s defunct 2016 campaign is working to “produce all docs related to the inquiry into Russian interference” in accordance with the Intelligence Committee’s formal request, though Stein doesn’t “believe they’ve given us search terms,” as their respective attorneys are still “in the process of working that out.” Stein added that she’s unaware of a deadline for this document handover, but “we are trying to comply as quickly as we possibly can. … There are a number of people we have to contact that we’re not in touch with, and they have to search as well.”</p>\n<p>It’s safe to assume the Intelligence Committee is interested in anything pertaining to Stein’s now-infamous attendance of an RT gala in Moscow, at which she was seated and photographed with Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Stein told The Intercept that as she has routinely appeared on RT and expects to hand over communications related to booking those TV segments and other “administrative” messages between her campaign and the Russian network, as well as “logistical” messages about the Moscow event. Stein also noted that before her Moscow visit, she had “requested to speak with either Putin or [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov, or someone in the Russian government, to be able to discuss our policies, because I was there to advance our agenda for peace and climate action and diplomacy and nuclear weapon abolition.”</p>\n<p>Stein says this request was not granted. Stein also maintains that she declined to let RT pay for any portion of her trip to Moscow and further denies requesting or receiving any other assistance, monetary or otherwise, from RT, the Russian government, WikiLeaks, or the Trump campaign, adding that any dialogue or cooperation with Trump “would have been quite contrary to our values.”</p>\n<p>When asked why she had attended the gala and sought an audience with Putin, she told The Intercept that “we sought contact with every powerful world leader we had access to,” and that the Russian government was of particular interest because of its involvement in the Syrian civil war. “We don’t have any reason to suspect that there was any backdoor communication,” Stein said. “We were very much focused on the substantive issues of the elections, and we avoid like the plague manipulations and machinations in order to make things happen behind the scenes.”</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Stein provided the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Responding to a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence request for documents pertaining to interference in the 2016 election, former Green Party Presidential candidate Jill Stein said she is cooperating by sharing all communications relevant to the committee’s mission. “We take seriously the issue of potential interference in our elections, as demonstrated by our continuing efforts to investigate the integrity of the 2016 election and examine our voting machines that are widely known to be vulnerable, but which still have not been examined for evidence of interference. To restore trust in our elections and democracy itself, we must safeguard our elections from all potential sources of interference, whether by foreign state actors or domestic political partisans, criminal networks, lone wolves, or private corporations – including those who control voting software.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our campaign has observed the highest standards of transparency and integrity in our interactions with foreign nationals as well as Americans. Our communications with Russian individuals regarding an invitation to speak on international relations at the RT 10th anniversary media conference will confirm what we stated publicly at that time and since: that we did not accept any payment or even reimbursement for the trip, and that we made the trip with the goal of reaching an international audience and Russian officials with a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy, and cooperation against the urgent threat of climate change, consistent with long-standing Green principles and policies.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We strongly support legitimate inquiry into any illegal activity in our elections – including quid pro quo deals, money laundering, corruption and violation of campaign finance laws. At the same time, we caution against the politicization, sensationalism and collapse of journalistic standards that has plagued media coverage of the investigation. In the current climate of attacks on our civil liberties, with the emergence of censorship in social media and the press, criminalization of protest, militarization of police and massive expansion of the surveillance state, we must guard against the potential for these investigations to be used to intimidate and silence principled opposition to the political establishment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stein said that she would release a more comprehensive statement about the investigation in the near future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Top photo: Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein speaks at a news conference on Fifth Avenue across the street from Trump Tower December 5, 2016 in New York City. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/18/jill-stein-will-hand-over-russia-related-communications-to-senate-commmittee/\">Jill Stein Will Hand Over Russia-Related Communications to Senate Committee</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\">The Intercept</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span><u>The “fake news</u> media” has been prosecuted throughout 2017 in the kangaroo court that is President Donald Trump’s Twitter account, but in a courtroom in Washington, D.C., the definition of journalism itself is on trial.</span></p>\n<p>The answer to the question will decide the fate of one of six people <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/17/j20-inauguration-protest-trump-riot-first-amendment/\">currently on trial</a> for their proximity to the protests that took place around Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Independent photographer and videographer Alexei Wood was arrested with hundreds of protesters, medics, and journalists in response to the violent actions of a few protesters on that day.</p>\n<p><span>On Thursday, Wood’s attorney, Brett Cohen, tried to get jurors at the D.C. Superior Court to understand the distinction between his client’s coverage of the violent acts at the protest and the commission of the violent acts themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span>In an interview with The Intercept, Wood said that part of the government’s case against him revolves around defining who is — and, in his case, isn’t — a journalist. That’s not a determination the state can make, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span>“They can take issue with my professionalism and my style, but they can’t decide what is or isn’t journalism,” Wood said. “They don’t get to have that.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Wood is an independent photojournalist from San Antonio, Texas, whose work focuses on resistance movements. He arrived in D.C. last January planning to document protests around the inauguration — both on January 20 and the Women’s March the following day. But Wood’s coverage of the weekend ended abruptly when he, along with over 200 others, were penned into an area at the intersection of L and 12th streets and arrested en masse. </span></p>\n<p><span>Individuals arrested at the Inauguration Day protests, known as J20, are being charged under blanket statutes for crimes committed during the action, including bashing windows and other property damage. To make its case against nearly 200 defendants, the prosecution is using the Pinkerton liability rule, which attributes every crime committed during a conspiracy to all those involved. In practice, this means that all defendants on trial for the protests can be convicted for all crimes committed during the action by mere virtue of their proximity to the crimes committed. </span></p>\n<p><span>Wood’s prosecution is alarming as a reflection of the government’s attempt to define — and criminalize — journalism, but the case as a whole also speaks to the government’s attempt to undermine the First Amendment right to political speech. “The government is prosecuting this case as though DisruptJ20” — the name given to the protest — “were a run-of-the-mill criminal conspiracy, where the only objective is criminal in nature, rather than a political demonstration designed to make a statement about the current administration,”</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shanakn?lang=en\"><span>Shana Knizhnik</span></a><span>, an attorney with the ACLU-DC, told The Intercept in an email. “This framing undermines the fundamental principles of the First Amendment.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“The concept of who is a journalist is so nebulous in today’s landscape,” Wood told The Intercept, referring to the prevalence of independent journalists. “The ability to produce information is democratized.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Cohen, Wood’s lawyer, raised the question of citizen journalism in his closing argument last week. “What is a journalist?” he asked rhetorically. “One thing we know about journalism is that the internet’s kind of expanding that definition,” Cohen said to the jury. “More people are broadcasting things. More people are reporting things.”</span></p>\n<p><span>If the prosecution has its way, Cohen argued, journalists will not be protected if their actions can in any way be construed as sympathetic to the movements they’re covering — up to and including such dubious ground as simply walking with a group of protesters who happen to engage in violent activities. </span></p>\n<p>The prosecution had submitted into evidence live stream footage captured by Wood, during which he could be heard cheering as other people sprayed graffiti and broke windows. The court last week decided that Wood’s cheering of the act did not rise to the level of incitement.</p>\n<p>In his bid to establish Wood’s credibility as a journalist, Cohen <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexei-wood-inauguration-trial-journalist-trump_us_5a2f0c39e4b01598ac4761bc\">presented the court with emails</a> between the journalist and editors at a San Antonio-based news outlet. In one email, Wood said he was “specifically focusing in on street friction, protest and support and police.”</p>\n<p><span><span>Jim Naureckas, editor of media watchdog</span><a href=\"http://fair.org\"> <span>Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting</span></a>, said he hopes the jury rejects the charges and rules against the government. Otherwise, the potential for accurate coverage of actions of dissent in American politics will suffer. “If these indictments are not rejected by juries,” Naureckas said, “we’ll see even less coverage of dissent than we already do, once it’s established that telling people about anything forbidden by police is the same as committing those acts.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Naureckas added, “It’s truly an Orwellian moment.”</span></p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/12/Alexei-Wood-j20-arrest-journalism-2-1513628803.jpg\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, USA - JANUARY 20: Police arrests anti-Trump protesters after smashing a bank's glass in Washington, USA on January 20, 2017.

The initial trial</span> <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/jury-deliberation-begins-j20-defendants-171215214546793.html\"><span>entered its first day of jury deliberations</span></a><span> and its 14th day overall on Monday. Despite the fact that attorneys for the prosecution have mishandled parts of the case so far — </span><a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2017/12/15/medics_observers_a_journalist_face_50\"><span>Judge Lynn Leibovitz on Thursday</span> acquitted the defendants of incitement</a><span> based on insufficient evidence — there’s still great potential for the case being used as the template for oppressive government action in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s untested waters. “They’re trying to do stuff that there’s not settled procedure for,” said Sam Menefee-Libey, an organizer with the group</span><a href=\"http://www.dclegalposse.org/\"> <span>Dead City Legal Posse</span></a><span>, which was created to provide support to the J20 arrestees during their trials. “The prosecution and defense are testing untrodden ground to try to come out on top.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“This case is just one example of this administration’s demonstrated contempt for the principles of free press,”said Knizhnik.</span><span> “We can only hope it doesn’t go [further].”</span></p>\n<p><span>Part of what’s complicating matters is the unique nature of the trial — both the prosecution and defense are figuring out the case law as they go. During court proceedings on December 14 and 15, the prosecution and defense teams held four sidebars with the judge to discuss the technicalities of the charges and iron out disagreements, court transcripts show.  </span></p>\n<p><span>Menefee-Libey told The Intercept that “the prosecution has been characterized by outrageous overreach” and that convictions based on the theory would have dire ramifications. “We can’t lose sight of the fact that the prosecution is relying on something that should terrify people if it works.”</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://journalism.columbia.edu/faculty/todd-gitlin\"><span>Todd Gitlin</span></a><span>, chair of the Ph.D. program at the Columbia School of Journalism, said the prosecution’s reasoning appears to be that by covering the J20 demonstration, Wood was publicizing the event and is therefore culpable for any crimes committed during the protest. “The principle here is horrific,” said Gitlin. “That anyone who is present as a recorder, a diffuser of information can be clapped into jail, that’s quite staggering.”</span></p>\n<p><span> “Obviously this is a sinister development,” Gitlin added.</span></p>\n<p><span>Massachusetts-based journalist Maya Shaffer, who often works with the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism, told The Intercept the fact that there’s even a trial is “profoundly chilling” for the freedom of speech and a free press. “I have covered many protests — BLM, Occupy, and more,” said Shaffer, “and under the legal precedent I fear could be set by J20, I am concerned that simply being at a protest, even in a media role, is being criminalized.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Alex Stokes is another journalist who was arrested on January 20, although the charges against him were dropped shortly thereafter. Stokes told The Intercept in October that he thinks the fact that he made so much noise about the arrest was likely why his charges were dismissed. “I talked to a lot of press and committees that deal with press freedom” in the weeks after being arrested, Stokes said. “Then I got a lawyer, pro bono — they dismissed the charges after that.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite the fact that he went free, Stokes was present on the day of the trial’s opening statements to show solidarity with the other arrestees. The prosecution is threatening a free press, Stokes told The Intercept. </span></p>\n<p><span>“If any of these defendants end up being convicted of anything given the lack of evidence, you can kiss both of those goodbye,” he said, referring to free speech and journalism. (Another journalist who faces charges, Aaron Cantú, has contributed to The Intercept, though he was not on assignment for the website on January 20.)</span></p>\n<p><span>“The J20 prosecutions epitomize the criminalization of both protest and journalism,” Naureckas said</span><span>.</span><span> “You don’t have to break a window to face decades in prison — merely sharing the opinions of those who break windows, or informing the public about broken windows, is sufficient to bring down the full wrath of the state.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Even if the government fails to convict any of the protesters on a single charge, the damage has been done. The time, money, and stress stemming from the prosecution will take a toll on the emotional and financial well-being of the defendants — and it sends a message to anyone planning an action in the future. “Regardless of the ultimate outcome of the trials, simply pressing these charges and forcing people to fight them is a drain on the defendants,” Shaffer said.</span></p>\n<p><span>Enduring serious charges with decades of potential prison time has a chilling effect on both journalists and activists, especially in this political climate, said Kris Hermes, a legal activist and author of the book “</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crashing-Party-Legacies-Lessons-2000/dp/1629631027\"><span>Crashing the Party: Legacies and Lessons From the RNC 2000</span></a><span>.” And, Hermes warned, the repression won’t stop with the type of protests that took place on January 20. “It’s not just the far left, anti-fascist, and anti-capitalists [at risk] from this demonstration,” said Hermes. “It’s all political and social movements writ large across the country that are at risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“The only conclusion is that the U.S. attorney doesn’t believe in the rights of citizen journalists,” said</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealAlexRubi\"> <span>Alex Rubinstein</span></a><span>, an independent journalist who was himself arrested on January 20 while covering the protest for RT. </span><span>Like the majority of established reporters who were arrested in the action, his charges were dismissed 10 days later.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now all there is to do is wait. “We hope the jury sees through the smokescreen,” said Hermes.</span></p>\n<p>Top photo: Alexei Wood stands outside the D.C.
